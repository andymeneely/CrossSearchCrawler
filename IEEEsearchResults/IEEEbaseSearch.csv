It protects virtual and physical computer networks against threats and vulnerabilities. Presently, machine learning techniques are widely extended to implement effective intrusion detection system. Neural network, statistical models, rule learning, and ensemble methods are some of the kinds of machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy.

Presumption that some techniques are well working against particular type of computer criminality leads to using those techniques against another type of computer criminality. An intrusion detection systems based on system behavior in general evaluates the behavior of observed system. Therefore the level of system observation is very important. We propose intrusion detection system that works at low level system observation. This is important because of many malicious codes nowadays mask their behavior and therefore is difficult to expose those malicious codes from user perspective.

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.",,978-1-4244-8448-5,978-0-7695-4236-2,10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852,ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence,Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation,computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems,biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator,,0,,16,,,4-6 Nov. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

An organization should find the methods to protect their data and network system to reduce the risk from attacks. Snort Intrusion Detection System (Snort-IDS) is a security tool of network security. It has been widely used for protecting the network of the organizations. The Snort-IDS utilize the rules to matching data packets traffic. If some packet matches the rules, Snort-IDS will generate the alert messages. However, Snort-IDS contain many rules and it also generates a lot of false alerts. In this paper, we present the procedure to improve the Snort-IDS rules for the network probe attack detection. In order to test the performance evaluation, we utilized the data set from the MIT-DAPRA 1999, which includes the normal and abnormal traffics. Firstly, we analyzed and explored the existing the Snort-IDS rules to improve the proposed Snort-IDS rules. Secondly, we applied the WireShark software to analyze data packets form of attack in data set. Finally, the Snort-IDS was improved, and it can detect the network probe attack. This paper, we had classified the attacks into several groups based on the nature of network probe attack. In addition, we also compared the efficacy of detection attacks between Snort-IDS rules to be updated with the Detection Scoring Truth. As the experimental results, the proposed Snort-IDS efficiently detected the network probe attacks compared to the Detection Scoring Truth. It can achieve higher accuracy.

Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: ""Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise"".

Intrusion Detection is a major component in computer security systems that can be classified as Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which protects a certain host or system and Network-based Intrusion detection system (NIDS), which protects a network of hosts and systems. This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module.

Intrusion Detection System with packet filtering for IP Spoofing,"Manusankar, C.; Karthik, S.; Rajendran, T.","Dept. of CSE, SNS Coll. of Technol., Coimbatore, India","Communication and Computational Intelligence (INCOCCI), 2010 International Conference on",20110324,2010,,,563,567,"IP Spoofing is a problem without an easy solution, since it's inherent to the design of the TCP/IP suite. Understanding how and why spoofing attacks are used, combined with a few simple prevention methods, can help protect your network from these malicious cloaking and cracking techniques.. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used to secure these environments for sharing their data over network and host based IDS approaches. The rapid improvements of intrusions in internet and other networks are the main factors responsible for the propagation of different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing environment. Now a days the Ids makes use of the signature based detection approach which detects the actions based on analyzing the patterns such as text, password, time etc. So this will create difficulties in updating information and detecting unknown attacks. In this paper we make use of an improved EADS (Exception Agent Detection System) for making the header information secure. Packet filtering is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. In this paper, we also propose an inter-domain packet_filter (IDPF) architecture that can mitigate the level of IP spoofing on the Interne together with the IDS. We establish the conditions under which the IDPF framework works correctly in that it does not discard packets with valid source addresses. In this paper we propose an improved behavioral method for combating the unknown threats other tha- the usual context and content scanning techniques.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738791,Exception agent system;IP spoofing;Intrusion detection system;Local area network;packet filter,Computer architecture;Computer science;Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Intrusion detection,IP networks;Internet;digital signatures;security of data,IP spoofing attack;Internet;TCP/IP network;content scanning techniques;cracking techniques;exception agent detection system;interdomain packet filter architecture;intrusion detection system;malicious cloaking;packet filtering;signature based detection,,1,,12,,,27-29 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48.

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system.

Intrusion detection system using Honey Token based Encrypted Pointers to mitigate cyber threats for critical infrastructure networks,"Asif, M.K.; Al-Harthi, Y.S.","Dept. of Electr.

The scale of damage that could be done on these infrastructures by well-planned cyber-attacks is enormous. Most of the research work done for the security of these critical infrastructures focuses on conventional security measures. In this paper, we designed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is based on the novel approach of Honey Token based Encrypted Pointers to prevent critical infrastructure networks from cyber-attacks particularly from zero day cyber threats. These honey tokens inside the frame will serve as a trap for the attacker. All nodes operating within the working domain of critical infrastructure network are divided into four different pools. This division is based according to their computational power and level of vulnerability. These pools are provided with different levels of security measures within the network. IDS use different number of Honey Tokens (HT) per frame for every different pool. Moreover every pool uses different types of encryption schemes (AES-128,192,256) etc. We use critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes for our simulations. We analyzed the performance of IDS in terms of True Positive and False Negative Alarms. Finally we test this IDS through Network Penetration Testing (NPT). This NPT is accomplished by putting the critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes directly under the zero day cyber-attacks and then we analyze the behavior of the IDS under such realistic conditions.

The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods.

Recently data mining and state transition analysis are becoming important components in identifying intrusions. This paper proposes a semantic based intrusion detection scheme where state transition analysis, pattern matching and data mining techniques are integrated to maximize the detection accuracy. Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder.

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues.

The traditional intrusion detection systems have been unable to meet new security requirements. This paper proposes a collaborative intrusion detection model based on multi-agents. In this model, four kinds of agents are defined, which are organized in a hierarchical structure. The basic agents in every host or at the entrances of subnets are responsible for performing the simple detection and response tasks. The complicated collaboration task is executed by some separate coordination agents, which are responsible for synthetically analyzing the suspicious behavior that the lower-level agents are unable to identify. Coordination agents are also able to assign the task to the lower-level associated agents. Based on the hierarchical structure, the formal description of the model is given. By adaptive policies and dynamic association among some elements, this model provides dynamic adaptability to the changing environment and attacks. In addition, this paper also proposes the concept of coordination domain which facilitates the management of collaborative detection.

New vulnerabilities are found from common programs and even on vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network of an entire company. There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator.

Anomaly-based IDSs need to be able to learn the dynamically changing behavior of users or systems. In this paper, we are experimenting with packet behavior as parameters in anomaly intrusion detection. There are several methods to assist IDSs to learn system's behavior.

A proactive security defense such as intrusion detection system has become a recent research topic in this area. Many intrusion detection models are proposed by the researchers and most of them are promising. How-ever, the problem in mobile ad-hoc environment is that communication and power resources are very limited. Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible. This paper presents a comparison study between the co-operative detection model and the aggregative detection model to evaluate the efficiency of resource usage.

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible.

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead.

One existing solution to this problem has been achieved by using Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios.

Relevance feature selection with data cleaning for intrusion detection system,"Suthaharan, S.; Panchagnula, T.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, USA","Southeastcon, 2012 Proceedings of IEEE",20120510,2012,,,1,6,"Labeled datasets play a major role in the process of validating and evaluating machine learning techniques in intrusion detection systems. In order to obtain good accuracy in the evaluation, very large datasets should be considered. Intrusion traffic and normal traffic are in general dependent on a large number of network characteristics called features. However not all of these features contribute to the traffic characteristics. Therefore, eliminating the non-contributing features from the datasets, to facilitate speed and accuracy to the evaluation of machine learning techniques, becomes an important requirement. In this paper we suggest an approach which analyzes the intrusion datasets, evaluates the features for its relevance to a specific attack, determines the level of contribution of feature, and eliminates it from the dataset automatically. We adopt the Rough Set Theory (RST) based approach and select relevance features using multidimensional scatter-plot automatically. A pair-wise feature selection process is adopted to simplify. In our previous research we used KDD'99 dataset and validated the RST based approach. There are lots of redundant data entries in KDD'99 and thus the machine learning techniques are biased towards most occurring events. This property leads the algorithms to ignore less frequent events which can be more harmful than most occurring events. False positives are another important drawback in KDD'99 dataset. In this paper, we adopt NSL-KDD dataset (an improved version of KDD'99 dataset) and validate the automated RST based approach. The approach presented in this paper leads to a selection of most relevance features and we expect that the intrusion detection research using KDD'99-based datasets will benefit from the good understanding of network features and their influences to attacks.",1091-0050,978-1-4673-1374-2,,10.1109/SECon.2012.6196965,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196965,NSL-KDD dataset;Rough Set Theory;intrusion detection;labeled datasets;relevance feature selection,Approximation methods;Cleaning;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning,feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;security of data,KDD'99-based datasets;NSL-KDD dataset;automated RST based approach;data cleaning;intrusion detection system;intrusion traffic;machine learning technique;multidimensional scatter-plot;network characteristics;network features;noncontributing feature;pairwise feature selection process;redundant data entries;relevance feature selection;rough set theory,,1,,17,,,15-18 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

PAIDS: A Proximity-Assisted Intrusion Detection System for Unidentified Worms,Zhenyun Zhuang; Ying Li; Zesheng Chen,"Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2009. COMPSAC '09. 33rd Annual IEEE International",20090922,2009,1,,392,399,"The wide spread of worms poses serious challenges to today's Internet.Various IDSes (intrusion detection systems) have been proposed to identify or prevent such spread. These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms.

Proper scheduling policies can improve system capability without requiring additional resources. LAS, a size-based scheduling policy which can achieve optimal mean response time by giving preferential analysis to short flows, is widely used in various aspects of network field. Due to the high variability property of Internet traffic, LAS favors short flows without penalizing large flows very much. Unfortunately, the inspection of large flows can not be guaranteed in those network intrusion detection systems on 10Gbps links, which are usually heavily loaded, or even overloaded. Although tiny in percentage, large flows comprise more than 50% of the total load, and therefore can not be ignored, especially when specified by users as critical. How to avoid starving large flows while still giving higher priority to short flows is a dilemma we have to face in practice. In this paper, we propose a QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy (QTL), which can remedy LAS' defect. The experimental results show that our QTL scheduling policy has approximately the same performance as LAS for short flows, and meanwhile exhibits greatly enhanced processing capability for large flows.",1530-1346,978-1-4244-7754-8,,10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546727,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546727,LAS;QoS-supported three-level scheduling (QTL);marked large flows;threat detection latency;threat loss rate,Inspection;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Queueing analysis;Scheduling;Time factors,Internet;quality of service;queueing theory;scheduling;security of data,Internet traffic;LAS;QTL;QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;network intrusion detection system;network security monitoring,,0,,21,,,22-25 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic.

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing.

Technol., Beijing, China","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2013 IEEE Symposium on",20140306,2013,,,179,184,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) module in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) consists of two components: Pre-filter and Rule Verification (RV). Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.",,,,10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942,Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort,Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV,feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data,MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component,,0,,19,,,7-10 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset.

Virtualization technology is another technology which goes along with the cloud environment which is used most widely to reduce the cost purchasing the hardware infrastructures in organizations. Henceforth, the Cloud Computing Systems can be easily intruded by various types of cyber attacks including Denial of Serv-ice (DoS) attack and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which utilize the entire resources like CPU, Memory, etc and makes the server to starve. This creates a major impact reducing the efficiency of the virtual machines. In the proposed method, attack can be overcome by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Mitigation Strategy which uses the SYN Cookie to prevent the attack in the cloud to prevent the attack in which the server ignores the connection packets when it does not receive the correct Acknowledgement (ACK) from the client which requested the connection. The server here has rules to be check whether it is a legitimate client or the spoofed one using the first layer of security for hop count filtering mechanism and second layer of security is encoding the sequence number of the SYN packet so that only a legitimate client can decode it.

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naïve fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naïve fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET.

A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly.

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.",0018-9340,,,10.1109/TC.2012.105,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739,Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness,Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates,computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic,Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design,,1,,40,,5/29/2012,Nov. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes. The system also proves that the proposed system is well suited for intrusion detection and prevention in wireless network.",,,,10.1109/ICESC.2014.73,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745417,AIS;congestion;intrusion detection;mobility,Bandwidth;Delays;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks,access protocols;artificial immune systems;jamming;packet radio networks;radio networks;security of data,AIS system;IP network;MAC address;agent based intrusion detection system;artificial immune system;jamming signal;negative clone selection;network topology;session hijacking;wireless intrusion signature;wireless network,,0,,12,,,9-11 Jan. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Most of the recent research on intrusion detection systems for wireless attacks either focuses on just one layer of observation or uses a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. The goal of this study is to detect injection types of attacks in wireless networks by fusing multi-metrics using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief theory. When combining beliefs, an important step to consider is the automatic and self-adaptive process of basic probability assignment (BPA). This study presents a comparison between manual and automatic BPA methods using the D-S technique. Custom tailoring BPAs in an optimum manner under specific network conditions could be extremely time consuming and difficult. In contrast, automatic methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior training or calibration from an administrator. The results show that multi-layer techniques perform more efficiently when compared with conventional methods.

The key section of code injection attack is a small piece of code, called shellcode, which performs unauthorized operations when it is injected into software as part of valid data. On Windows CE, input data are often encoded using Unicode before being processed. In such cases, shellcode should be built in a way that bypasses such encoding; that is, it should be Unicode-proof. Unicode-proof shellcode also has great advantage of evading instruction detection system. However, it is quite difficult to build Unicode-proof shellcode for the ARM architecture, on which most embedded devices are developed, because the subset of instructions that can be used to write Unicode-proof shellcode is very limited. Moreover, the instruction cache in the ARM processor restricts the application of self-modifying code, which is frequently used in shellcode writing. This novel research proposes an approach to building ARM Unicode-proof shellcode on Windows CE under these constraints.

These networks can be formed, merged or partitioned into separate networks on the fly, without necessarily relying on a fixed infrastructure to manage the operation. Two important properties of an ad-hoc network are that it is self-organized and adaptive. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) where security is a crucial issue, trust plays an important factor that could improve the number of successful data transmission process. The higher the numbers of nodes that trust each other in the network means the higher successful communication process rates could be expected. Since there is no central controller to determine the reliable & Secure communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail.

Intrusion detection systems monitor and inspect the packets traversing over a network ensuring deep packet analysis. But as the attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated, IDS available today are unable to address challenges that surround different types of attacks, since they are designed to handle specific types of attacks only.

Cloud Computing systems can be easily threatened by various cyber attacks, because most of Cloud Computing systems provide services to so many people who are not proven to be trustworthy. Therefore, a Cloud Computing system needs to contain some Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSs) for protecting each Virtual Machine(VM) against threats. In this case, there exists a tradeoff between the security level of the IDS and the system performance. If the IDS provide stronger security service using more rules or patterns, then it needs much more computing resources in proportion to the strength of security. So the amount of resources allocating for customers decreases. Another problem in Cloud Computing is that, huge amount of logs makes system administrators hard to analyse them.

This system, intended mainly for Internet censorship, is a national-scale filter based on intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies. Our results indicate that the Chinese censors discontinued this HTML response filtering for the majority of routes some time between August 2008 and January 2009 (other forms of censorship, including backbone-level GET request filtering, are still in place). In this paper, we give evidence to show that the distributed nature of this filtering system and the problems inherent to distributed filtering are likely among the reasons it was discontinued, in addition to potential traffic load problems. When the censor successfully detected a keyword in our measurements and attempted to reset the connection, their attempt to reset the connection was successful less than 51% of the time, due to late or out-of-sequence resets. In addition to shedding light on why HTML response filtering may have been discontinued by the censors, we document potential sources of uncertainty, which are due to routing and protocol dynamics, that could affect measurements of any form of censorship in any country. Between a single client IP address in China and several contiguous server IP addresses outside China, measurement results can be radically different.

In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS.

However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques.

Performance Evaluation of Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS for MANET,"Agrawal, A.; Patidar, M.; Sharma, M.K.","Dept. of CSE, SIMS, Indore, India","IT in Business, Industry and Government (CSIBIG), 2014 Conference on",20150312,2014,,,1,6,"MANET is an infrastructure less network and can work without any devices dependencies. These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node.

This is a main cause of high false rates and inaccurate detection rates in IDS. In this paper, we propose a new approach named quantitative intrusion intensity assessment (QIIA). QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal.

A WSN is a versatile smart sensing system to support pervasive monitoring in a variety of applications. In this context available middleware platforms usually provide the Application Layer with different basic services, as shared memory or addressing repository, but do not usually provide security services such as secure links management protocol or intrusion detection. Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN.

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes.

Network anomaly detection tools based on association rules,"Othman, Z.A.; Eljadi, E.E.","Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ. Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia","Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI), 2011 International Conference on",20110919,2011,,,1,7,"With the growth of computer networks, the number of attacks posing serious security risks for networks has grown extensively. Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.",2155-6822,978-1-4577-0753-7,,10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705,Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS),Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces,computer network security;data mining,CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule,,1,,25,,,17-19 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

High-Performance Intrusion Detection Using OptiGrid Clustering and Grid-Based Labelling,"Ishida, M.; Takakura, H.; Okabe, Y.","Grad.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.",,978-1-4577-0531-1,978-0-7695-4423-6,10.1109/SAINT.2011.12,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129,OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system,Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data,feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data,KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data,,3,,16,,,18-21 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Different from the general server, once the cloud environment suffered from malicious attacks, people or companies will get caught in extreme dangers. Therefore, it is important for network security in cloud. Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix.

Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol.

Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game.

Bayesian Model Averaging of Bayesian Network Classifiers for Intrusion Detection,"Liyuan Xiao; Yetian Chen; Chang, C.K.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Iowa State Univ.

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset. This also implies that the BNMA is beneficial in accelerating the detection process due to its less dependance on the potentially prolonged process of collecting large training datasets.",,,,10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.25,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903117,Bayesian Model Averaging;Bayesian network;Intrusion detection system;detection accuracy,Accuracy;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training,belief networks;pattern classification;security of data;statistical analysis,BN classifiers;BNMA classifier;Bayesian model averaging;Bayesian network classifiers;KDD Cup 99 dataset;NSL-KDD dataset;detection accuracy;heuristic methods;intrusion detection;probability distribution;reasoning capabilities,,0,,27,,,21-25 July 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

People use their smartphones to keep their contact data, to browse the internet, to exchange messages, to keep notes, carry their personal files and documents, etc. Users while browsing are also capable of shopping online, thus provoking a need to type their credit card numbers and security codes. As the smartphones are becoming widespread, it's also becoming a popular target for security threats and attack. Since smartphones use the same software architecture as in PCs, they are vulnerable to be exposed to similar threats such as in PCs. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS).

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet.

Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures.

The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of TorWard. Our data shows that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malware have been identified.

These malicious attempts including hacking, botnets and works are pushing organization networks to a risky atmosphere where the intruder tries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of resources. In order to detect these malicious activities, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been widely deployed in corporate networks. IDSs play an important role in monitoring traffic behaviors in a computer network, identifying the anomalous activity and notifying the security analyst with current network status. Unfortunately, one of the IDSs' drawbacks is they produce a large number of false positives and non-relevant positives alerts that could overwhelm the security analyst. Therefore, the process of analyzing alerts in order to provide a more synthetic and high-level view of the attempted intrusions is needed. This process is called Alert Correlation.

As the SIP is gaining popularity, open architecture of VoIP often makes SIP vulnerable to so many threats. The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads. Moreover the associated signatures database can also be incorporated into other VoIP protocols and open source IDSs like SNORT.

To understand the interplay underlying this problem, we formulate a Bayesian model, where the IDS faces a scanning allocation dilemma: if the intruder has no knowledge, then all the bands are under equal threat, while if the intruder has complete knowledge, then less-protected bands are more likely to be threatened. We solve this dilemma and show the optimal IDS strategy switches between the optimal response to these threats.

Identification of network intrusion with efficient Genetic Algorithm using Bayesian classifier,"Sangeetha, K.; Periasamy, P.S.; Prakash, S.","Comput. Sci. & Eng., SNS Coll. of Technol., Coimbatore, India","Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), 2015 International Conference on",20150824,2015,,,1,4,"In the field of computer security, the intrusion detection system plays a major role. Whenever the intrusion takes place, intrusion detection technology is used to ensure the data integrity and system availability. Normally the intrusion is considered as an abnormal activity performed by the intruder. The breaking of information system or occurrence of any abnormal activity if performed by the intruder is known as intrusion. Based on the nature of access the intruders can be broadly classified into two groups, as internal intruders and external intruders. One who is having the access permission but trying to perform unauthorized or illegal activities is known as internal intruders. On the other hand one who do not have the access permission, but attacks the system with variety of techniques is called identified as external intruders. The IDS is a security management system for the computers and networks. It helps in monitoring and detecting all the activity which takes place in the Network. On consideration, the firewall technology works on the predetermined rule set. In contrast to this, IDS is potential to be present throughout the network as dynamic defense system. Hence it helps to catch all types of attacks. Genetic Algorithms (GA) is a method of search through solution space towards an optimal solution that uses the mechanics of natural selection and genetics. The main motivating factor for using GA is that it makes no use of domain knowledge; it works on probabilistic techniques making use of payoff data. Another huge advantage that GA has over other learning systems is that GA is totally unsupervised, once set in motion, it presents the user with a good solution. These coupled with the versatility and robustness of GA makes the technique of choice for this work.

In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier.

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack.

When the threat (intrusion) is detected, the workflow system needs to be stopped immediately to avoid any possible loss of enterprise data. The system becomes active again, once it is completely recovered from the threat. This proposed framework overcomes the problem of discontinuity of services as a result of threat detection by enabling the execution of the workflow on an alternate path, keeping the security and integrity of the asset information intact. Hence the system remains available all the time in a secured fashion making it possible for the end user to access the services and data even in the vulnerable state. To achieve the specified goals, the special authentication mechanism has been adopted to authorize the users after threat is detected. Then the data is hibernated that is transferred to the designed dimensions and the connectivity and access to the hibernated data is provided by the chameleon agent.

However, existing parallel schemes often fail to achieve linear speedup in IDS. The throughput even deteriorates severely for some network traffics. Hence, exploring and addressing the problems have become one of the most urgent issues in parallel IDS. In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system. Second, we propose a new fingerprint extraction strategy to deal with HRF. Experimental results show that the throughput deterioration is resolved completely and the throughput is enhanced by 45% by integrating our proposed method into the test bed and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.",,978-1-4577-2135-9,,10.1109/TrustCom.2011.86,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120879,Intrusion Detection System;Snort;multi-core;pre-fliter;software pipeline,,,,,0,,20,,,16-18 Nov. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

We claim that of course our model is not only a detective model but also a correctional model. because first we corner malicious nodes and then we give them incentives to mend their ways and try to behave in favor of other nodes in WSN. We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant.

A Novel Framework of Dynamic Learning Based Intrusion Detection Approach in MANET,"Shirbhate, S.V.; Sherekar, S.S.; Thakare, V.M.",,"Computing Communication Control and Automation (ICCUBEA), 2015 International Conference on",20150716,2015,,,209,213,"With the growth of security and surveillance system, a huge amount of audit or network data is being generated. It is immense challenge for researcher to protect the mobile ad hoc network from the malicious node as topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious node can easily inject false routes into the network. A traditional method to detect such malicious nodes is to establish a base profile of normal network behavior and then identify a node's behavior to be anomalous if it deviates from the established profile. As the topology of a MANET constantly changes over time, the simple use of a static base profile is not efficient. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to detect the malicious node in MANET. In proposed method k-means clustering-based anomaly detection approach is used in which the profile is dynamically updated. The approach consists of three main phases: training, testing and updating. In training phase, the K-means clustering algorithm is used in order to establish a normal profile. In testing phase, check whether the current traffic of the node is normal or anomalous. If it is normal then update the normal profile otherwise isolate the malicious node and ignore that node from the network. To update the normal profile periodically, weighted coefficients and a forgetting equation is used.",,,,10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.46,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155836,Dynamic Intrusion Detection System;K-means clustering;MANET,Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Testing;Training,mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security,MANET;anomaly detection approach;dynamic learning;intrusion detection approach;k-means clustering;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc network;network data;novel framework;security system;static base profile;surveillance system;topology node,,0,,16,,,26-27 Feb. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

This KDD CUP 1999 data set was generated by domain expert at MIT Lincon lab. To reduced number of features of this KDD CUP data set, various feature reduction techniques has been already used. These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al. Tesfahun's approach reduces time and complexity of model and improves the detection rate for the minority classes in a considerable amount. This work investigates the effectiveness and the feasibility of Tesfahun et al.'s feature reduction technique on Back Propagation Neural Network classifier. We had performed various experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset and recorded Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Fscore values. In this work, we had done Basic, N-Fold Validation and Testing comparisons on reduced dataset with full feature dataset. Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters. Experiments of N-Fold validation show that classifier that uses reduced dataset, have better generalization capacity. During the testing comparison, we found both the datasets are equally compatible. All the three comparisons clearly show that reduced dataset is better or is equally compatible, and does not have any drawback as compared to full dataset.

Situation Awareness Measurement Enhanced for Efficient Monitoring in the Internet of Things,"Gendreau, A.A.","Comput. Sci. & Comput. Inf. Syst, St. Leo Univ., St. Leo, FL, USA","Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP), 2015 IEEE",20150727,2015,,,82,85,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a heterogeneous network of objects that communicate with each other and their owners over the Internet. In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power. Potentially, this approac- can be used to design a more energy efficient cluster-based management and monitoring algorithm for the advancement of security, e.g. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and other standards in the IoT.",,,,10.1109/TENSYMP.2015.13,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166243,Internet of Things;Intrusion detection system;Situational awareness;Wireless sensor networks,Energy efficiency;Internet of things;Monitoring;Security;Standards;Wireless sensor networks,Internet of Things;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks,Internet of Things;WPAN;WSN;distributed technologies;efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability;heterogeneous network;object monitoring and tracking capabilities;situation awareness measurement;situation awareness metric;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor networks,,0,,12,,,13-15 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security.

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps.

In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment.

Sometimes, complainants are often bewildered and confused because it is almost certain that the prime suspects will be absolved in courts of law.

The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making.

However, it is not guaranteed that the bandwidth necessary to transmit all aggregated alerts is always available, which usually result in the transmission of a portion of the alerts, while others are discarded or queued. The transmission of insufficient alert information hinders making correct decisions about attacks, leading to compromising network security. In order to maximize the benefits of data aggregation while minimizing the impact of partial alerts, this paper presents a risk-driven real-time transmission prioritization technique for implementing lossy and lossless aggregation of cyber alerts. Lossy alert aggregation and transmission are managed adaptively by allowing the prioritization and transmission of aggregated alerts according to the risk assessment of such alerts. This paper also presents a risk-driven utilization model that further adapts the aggregation and prioritization in response to dynamic network conditions.

Port scanning detection has received a lot of attention by researchers. However a slow port scan attack can deceive most of the existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this paper, we present a new, simple, and efficient method for detecting slow port scans. Our proposed method is mainly composed of two phases: (1) a feature collection phase that analyzes network traffic and extracts the features needed to classify a certain IP as malicious or not. (2) A classification phase that divides the IPs, based on the collected features, into three groups: normal IPs, suspicious IPs and scanner IPs. The IPs our approach classify as suspicious are kept for the next (K) time windows for further examination to decide whether they represent scanners or legitimate users. Hence, this approach is different than the traditional approach used by IDSs that classifies IPs as either legitimate or scanners, and thus producing a high number of false positives and false negatives. A small Local Area Network was put together to test our proposed method. The experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method in correctly identifying malicious scanners when both normal and slow port scan were performed using the three most common TCP port scanning techniques.

Consequently, intrusion detectors that adopt allowable and disallowable concepts are used in network forensics. The disallowable policy enforcers alert on events that are known to be bad while the allowable policy enforcers monitor events that deviate from known good. Nevertheless, sophisticated cases of computer attacks often render attempts to isolate failed attacks from successful attacks ineffective. Thus, attacks are erroneous interpreted and most successful cases of computer attacks are not forestalled while in progress despite the huge volume of warnings that intrusion detectors generate beforehand.

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced. This string matching algorithm can be implemented in FPGA, which can provide very fast and efficient scanning with less memory space occupied.

The disallowable policy enforcers will alert only on events that are known to be bad while the allowable policy enforcer will alert on events that deviate from those that have been classified as good.

Accordingly, intrusion detectors generate tons of alerts that may signify realistic and false attacks. Most often, failed attacks are erroneously predicted and processed while classification trees that should have given detail descriptions of each clusters of the attacks are poorly constructed. This is because the qualities of clustering schemes that are generated are not evaluated with an appropriate model.

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software.

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated.

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with Regular Expression (RegEx) detection is the de facto defense mechanism agains network intrusions. However, current RegEx detection systems cannot keep up with the upcoming high-speed line rate. The RegExes consist of three types of components, exact strings, character classes (CC), and repetitions. Exact string and repetition matching have been widely studied by RegEx research community for better performance. Yet, although more than 55% of RegExes in Snort signature set contain at least one CC, hardware based solutions that focus on CC detection is limited. In this paper we propose a new CC detection architecture called Range Hash that is suitable for high-speed, compact CC detection.

Most of causal methods can be deployed offline but not in real-time due to time and memory limitations. In the proposed method the knowledge base of attack patterns is represented in a graph model called Causal Relations Graph. In offline, we construct some trees related to alerts probable correlations. In real-time for each received alert, we can find its correlations with previously received alerts by performing a search only in the corresponding tree. Thus processing time of each alert decreases significantly. In addition, the proposed method is immune to the deliberately slowed attacks.

Existing solutions such as portable microwave or passive infra-red (PIR) sensors are relatively inexpensive, but cannot work over uneven terrain, around corners, or in foliage. The cost and installation complexity of these sensors increases rapidly as more units are required. The Repels<sup>reg</sup> RF sensor provides many of the required features, but uses sensor cables that are overtly mounted above ground. The OmniTrax<sup>reg</sup> technology was first introduced at the 2004 Carnahan Conference, applying ultra wide band radar principles to a ranging leaky cable guided radar sensor. In 2007, a program called TFDIDS (terrain following deployable intrusion detection sensor) was initiated in conjunction with the US Air Force, to apply the advancements in this ranging technology to the rapid deployment sensor needs defined by the USAF tactical automated sensor system (TASS). This advancement includes a novel invention employing the processing of dual parallel leaky sensor cables, termed Stereo OmniTrax. This processing dramatically improves the discrimination between human intrusion threats and small nuisance targets or environmental effects. The TFDIDS system provides a complete lightweight sensor kit for the rapid deployment (less than 30 minutes) of a 100 m detection zone, and later, for the sensor's retrieval and reuse. TFDIDS interfaces to standard Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) including USAF powering and communications devices. This paper outlines the key elements of the TFDIDS design, describes its components, and explains how TFDIDS provides reliable detection using a surface sensor cable deployment.

Such evidence can be useful for designing efficient countermeasures that will thwart multiple attacks in progress. However, some intruders may take total control of computer networks over time while others may decide to partially compromise certain segments of their targets. Consequently, most intrusion analysts often find it difficult to establish hidden correlations between these two categories of probes and their associated objectives. This paper uses time series analysis to reconstruct workloads using baselines in the range of t<sub>1</sub> = 1s to t<sub>60</sub> = 60s for each intrusion log.

P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions.

Even the cryptographic protocols, which are used to provide secure communication, are often targeted by diverse attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often employed to monitor network traffic and host activities that may lead to unauthorized accesses and attacks against vulnerable services. Most of the conventional misuse-based and anomaly-based IDSs are ineffective against attacks targeted at encrypted protocols since they heavily rely on inspecting the payload contents. To combat against attacks on encrypted protocols, we propose an anomaly-based detection system by using strategically distributed monitoring stubs (MSs). We have categorized various attacks against cryptographic protocols. The MSs, by sniffing the encrypted traffic, extract features for detecting these attacks and construct normal usage behavior profiles. Upon detecting suspicious activities due to the deviations from these normal profiles, the MSs notify the victim servers, which may then take necessary actions. In addition to detecting attacks, the MSs can also trace back the originating network of the attack. We call our unique approach DTRAB since it focuses on both Detection and TRAceBack in the MS level.

This is achieved after classifying each Google dorks (commands) as an invisible attacks according to their characteristics. In addition, a method is devised to secure any organization's network against invisible attacks by creating a rule in Snort NIDPS signature database. Furthermore, OWASP risk rating methodology is incorporated to assess the overall severity risk level of invisible attacks on the network in terms of high, medium and low.

Hierarchically clustering technique is able to help IDS operators to get meaningful overviews from the great number of alarms. A dilemma is encountered when the clusters are generated. If the clusters are obtained one by one, they cannot be prevented from overlapping each other, which makes it quite likely to mislead the operator, if they are obtained in a batch, the total number of clusters must be guessed before clustering, which indicates possibly imprecise cluster number or repeated running. In this paper, we propose a GA (genetic algorithm)-based approach in which vary-lengthed chromosomes are adopted instead of fixed-lengthed chromosomes. The encoding scheme is that different numbers of clusters are encoded into different lengths of chromosomes. In addition, the other genetic operations such as selection, crossover and mutation, are discussed in detail.

To overcome this shortcoming, many researchers have been developing anomaly-based IDSs. Although they can detect unknown attacks, there is a problem that they just classify network traffic into normal or abnormal. Therefore, IDS operators have to manually inspect IDS alerts to classify them into known attacks or unknown attacks.

The proposed scheme takes advantage from heterogeneous nature of devices in smart home for effectively detecting anomalies. The anomaly detection infrastructure is installed at resource rich nodes such as Cluster Heads (CHs).The mobile agent takes only few bytes of data to further assess the anomalous behavior of suspicious node. The analysis and comparative study show several advantages of the proposed scheme, such as efficient utilization of memory, reducing network load, and reduction in overall computational cost of the network.

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software.

However the speed of data packet capture and analysis doesn't match the network application, which causes a general problem in IDS and the ratio of data packet lost is quite high. Various intrusion detection technologies are widely used to solve this problem. In those technologies, the pattern matching based on knowledge is the most popular technology. It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way.

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios.

Attacks on virtual machine can disrupt the normal operation of cloud infrastructure. In order to secure the virtual environment, defence mechanism is highly imperative at each virtual machine to identify the attacks occurring at virtual machine in timely manner. This work proposes In-and-Out-of-the-Box Virtual Machine and Hypervisor based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System for virtualized environment to ensure robust state of the virtual machine by detecting followed by eradicating rootkits as well as other attacks. We conducted experiments using popular open source Host based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) called Open Source SECurity Event Correlator (OSSEC).

A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures. Then, we insert probes in select locations in the application to enable online signature matching.

Event Correlation for Intrusion Detection Systems,"Dwivedi, N.; Tripathi, A.",,"Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), 2015 IEEE International Conference on",20150402,2015,,,133,139,"Intrusion Detection System (IDS) have grown into a mature and feature rich technology that provides advanced features to detect intrusion and provide responses. It also allows the management system for security analysis by monitoring, configuring and analyzing the intrusion data. A better understanding of alerts by using a general framework and infrastructure for detecting intrusions through event correlation strategy minimizes the amount of data generated. Event correlation techniques are needed for two reasons. First, network attack detection is usually based on information or data received from distributed sensors, e.g. intrusion detection systems. During attacks, the generated amount of events is hard to handle and so it is difficult to evaluate the current attack situation for a larger network. Thus, the concept of event or alert correlation has been introduced. Event correlation paints a picture of what is now being called as network or cyber situational awareness and tries to guide the security administrator on the actions that he can take to mitigate the crisis. The aim of the event correlation for intrusion detection system (IDS) is to improve security by correlating events and reduce the workload on an IDS analyst. This correlation has been achieved by getting together similar alerts, thus allowing the analyst to only look at a few alerts instead of hundreds or thousands of alerts. In this paper, we correlate the results of SNORT Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with SEC (Simple Event Correlator) by taking the input from the MIT DARPA (Defense advanced Research Projects Agency) dataset. The alerts generated from Snort are very large and so it is difficult for the administrators to identify them. Here we correlate the alerts based on same name coming from different IP address.

It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture.

The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values.

In this paper we describe an anomaly-based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, based on tempo-spatial data analysis technique to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocol is based on n-gram pattern analysis.

Selecting appropriate network features is one of the factors that influence the accuracy of SDC model. Past research has shown that the Hidden Marcov Chain, Genetic Algorithm, and the two-second time windows are among the best features selection methods for SDC Model. However this paper aims to improve the accuracy model by applying the features extraction based customized features. The customized features are the network data set which has been preprocessed through the following steps: removing biased attributes, discretized using chi-merge and remove the attributes with string value. The previous research applies the feature extraction based on all features. The best model is measured based on the detection rate, false alarm rate and number of rules using four data mining techniques such as Ripper(Jrip), Ridor, PART and decision three. The experiment is conducted using three random KDD-cup99 data sets. The result shows that the features extraction based on customized features has increased the accuracy model between 0.4% to 9% detection rates and reduced between 0.17% to 0.5% false alarm rates.

Although intrusion tolerance has been applied in many areas of security for years, few researches are referred to network forensics.

Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value.

Suricata includes multi-threading to improve processing speed beyond Snort. Previous work comparing the two products has not used a real-world setting. We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its "" backbone"" in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48.

To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization approach based on the behavioral study of animals/birds that outperforms GA in some applications.

Adaptive ACKnowledgement technique with key exchange mechanism for MANET,"Sandhiya, D.; Sangeetha, K.; Latha, R.S.","Dept. of CSE, Kongu Eng. Coll., Erode, India","Electronics and Communication Systems (ICECS), 2014 International Conference on",20140908,2014,,,1,5,"Mobile Adhoc NETwork (MANET) is self configuring network of mobile nodes connected by wireless links and it is considered as network without infrastructure. Routing protocol in MANET operates on the basic assumption that nodes are fully cooperative. Because of open infrastructure and limited battery power some nodes may not cooperate correctly. These nodes start refusing to forward data packets or drop them thereby degrades the performance of network. So it is very essential to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to prevent MANET from attacks. The IDS Watchdog, fails to detect node misbehavior in the presence of ambiguous collisions, receiver collisions, limited transmission power, false misbehavior, collusion and partial dropping. An intrusion detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) has been developed which consists of three parts, namely, ACK, Secure ACK (S-ACK), and Misbehavior Report Authentication (MRA). All the acknowledgement packets are digitally signed and verified to prevent forged acknowledgement packets. For signing and verifying the acknowledgement packets, keys are generated and distributed in advance. The proposed system uses One-hop ACK which is used to improve misbehavior detection rates. Basic drawback of S-ACK includes it cannot distinguish exactly which particular node is misbehaving node. Sometime well behaving nodes became a part of misbehaving link. Thus lot of well behaved node may be avoided by network which results in losing of well behaved routes.

An important component of the CPS devices is the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless, current security models consider protecting only networking components of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS devices.

In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%.

The goal is to identify and to cluster different alerts-produced by low-level intrusion detection systems, firewalls, etc.-belonging to a specific attack instance which has been initiated by an attacker at a certain point in time. Thus, meta-alerts can be generated for the clusters that contain all the relevant information whereas the amount of data (i.e., alerts) can be reduced substantially. Meta-alerts may then be the basis for reporting to security experts or for communication within a distributed intrusion detection system. We propose a novel technique for online alert aggregation which is based on a dynamic, probabilistic model of the current attack situation. Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low.

This traditional approach to security of computer systems is primarily oriented to the defence against already existing threats. It is essential to adapt the security system to this trend as the current threats have much more aggressive forms.

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem.

Among hardware approaches, memory-based architecture has attracted a lot of attention because of its easy reconfigurability and scalability. In order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful network intrusion detection system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement. For Snort rule sets, the new algorithm achieves 21% of memory reduction compared with the traditional Aho-Corasick algorithm.

Analyzing Log Files for Postmortem Intrusion Detection,"Garcia, K.A.; Monroy, R.; Trejo, L.A.; Mex-Perera, C.; Aguirre, E.","Scotiabank, Mexico City, Mexico","Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, IEEE Transactions on",20121221,2012,42,6,1690,1704,"Upon an intrusion, security staff must analyze the IT system that has been compromised, in order to determine how the attacker gained access to it, and what he did afterward. Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%.

Botnets are collections of compromised computers which are remotely controlled by its originator (BotMaster) under a common Commond-and-Control (C&C) infrastructure. They provide a distributed platform for several illegal activities such as launching distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against critical targets, malware distribution, phishing, and click fraud. Most of the existing Botnet detection approaches concentrate only on particular Botnet command and control (C&C) protocols (e.g., IRC, HTTP) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can become ineffective as Botnets change their structure and C&C techniques. The detection of Botnet has been a major research topic in recent years. Different techniques and approaches have been proposed for detection and tracking of Botnet. This survey classifies Botnet detection techniques into two approaches. One approach is based on setting up honeynets and another approach is based on Intrusion Detection System( IDS) which has been categorized into signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques.",,978-1-4244-5537-9,,10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563555,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563555,Botnet;P2P;bot;malicious activities;patterns,Computational modeling;Computers;Cryptography;Monitoring,Internet;command and control systems;computer crime;cryptographic protocols;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail,Botnet detection technique;Commond-and-Control infrastructure;Taxonomy;anomaly based detection technique;compromised computer;cyber attack;distributed denial of service;honeynet;intrusion detection system;malware distribution,,8,,28,,,9-11 July 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,
Block storage listener for detecting file-level intrusions,"Allalouf, M.; Ben-Yehuda, M.; Satran, J.; Segall, I.","IBM Res., Haifa, Israel","Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST), 2010 IEEE 26th Symposium on",20100628,2010,,,1,12,"An intrusion detection system (IDS) is usually located and operated at the host, where it captures local suspicious events, or at an appliance that listens to the network activity. Providing an online IDS to the storage controller is essential for dealing with compromised hosts or coordinated attacks by multiple hosts. SAN block storage controllers are connected to the world via block-level protocols, such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel. Usually, block-level storage systems do not maintain information specific to the file-system using them. The range of threats that can be handled at the block level is limited. A file system view at the controller, together with the knowledge of which arriving block belongs to which file or inode, will enable the detection of file-level threats. In this paper, we present IDStor, an IDS for block-based storage. IDStor acts as a listener to storage traffic, out of the controller's I/O path, and is therefore attractive for integration into existing SAN-based storage solutions. IDStor maintains a block-to-file mapping that is updated online. Using this mapping, IDStor infers the semantics of file-level commands from the intercepted block-level operations, thereby detecting file-level intrusions by merely observing the block read and write commands passing between the hosts and the controller.",,978-1-4244-7152-2,978-1-4244-7153-9,10.1109/MSST.2010.5496974,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496974,,Access protocols;Control systems;Event detection;File systems;Home appliances;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Storage area networks;Telecommunication traffic,file organisation;security of data;storage area networks,SAN block storage controller;block level protocol;file level command;file level intrusion detection system;storage area network;storage controller,,1,,18,,,3-7 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The algorithms are applied locally to measurements collected from three locations of an experimental network and under two attack intensities. The results show that the cumulative sum algorithms are more robust and achieve higher performance under both attack intensities.

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack.

Various Forward Error Correction mechanisms are applied in the presence of a network intrusion detection system and its impact on the resulting video quality is investigated.",2156-7190,978-1-4244-8150-7,978-0-7695-4185-3,10.1109/INTERNET.2010.27,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616479,network intrusion detection systems;video quality,,computer network security;data compression;forward error correction;invasive software,FEC-protected uncompressed video transmissions;delay variations;forward error correction;multimedia services;original packet sequence;security devices;software-based NIDS;software-based network intrusion detection system;video quality,,0,,11,,,20-25 Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,
Optimizing the decision to expel attackers from an information system,"Ning Bao; Musacchio, J.","Technol. of Inf. Manage.

Allerton 2009. 47th Annual Allerton Conference on",20100122,2009,,,644,651,"The conventional reaction after detecting an attacker in an information system is to expel the attacker immediately. However the attacker is likely to attempt to reenter the system, and if the attacker succeeds in reentering, it might take some time for the defender's intrusion detection system (IDS) to re-detect the attacker's presence. In this interaction, both the attacker and defender are learning about each other - their vulnerabilities, intentions, and methods. Moreover, during periods when the attacker has reentered the system undetected, he is likely learning faster than the defender. The more the attacker learns, the greater the chance that he succeeds in his objective - whether it be stealing information, inserting malware, or some other objective. Conversely, the greater the defender's knowledge, the more likely that the defender can prevent the attacker from succeeding. In this setting, we study the defender's optimal strategy for expelling or not expelling an intruder. We find that the policy of always expelling the attacker can be far from optimal. Furthermore, by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), we find how the optimal decision depends on the state variables and model parameters that characterize the IDS's detection rate and the attacker's persistence.",,978-1-4244-5870-7,,10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394923,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394923,,Computer security;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection,Markov processes;decision theory;information systems;invasive software,Markov decision process;attacker detection;attacker expelling;information system;intrusion detection system;malware,,0,,12,,,Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Two-tier data-driven intrusion detection for automatic generation control in smart grid,"Ali, M.Q.; Yousefian, R.; Al-Shaer, E.; Kamalasadan, S.; Quanyan Zhu","Dept. of Software & Inf.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment.

Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.",,978-1-4244-4488-5,978-1-4244-4487-8,10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038,,Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput,computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic,IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats,,0,,23,,,20-23 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions.

DFA-Based Regular Expression Matching on Compressed Traffic,Yan Sun; Min Sik Kim,"Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic.

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set.

Open medium, wide distribution and de-centralization of nodes makes MANETs vulnerable and malicious. It is crucial to develop efficient intrusion detection system to protect MANETs. A new intrusion detection system named bandwidth shared acknowledgment (BSA) in which all transmission packet data and acknowledge should be cryptographically signed. Swarm Based Detection techniques for multiple paths establishment among source to destination and random casting is use during intrusion in MANETs. Eavesdropping in MANET is scheduled based on number of acknowledgement received at every instance in network. The theme of this paper is to provide a seamless message delivery in a MANET despite its threats using random casting and the existing mechanisms like 2-hop acknowledgement or source directed acknowledgement does not hold when a network topology changes frequently or when a node is compromised. These drawbacks are to be addressed ensuring secured connecting edges between source and destination. The source collision, exposure to vulnerability is also minimized using this mechanism.

A traditional packet-based Network IDS (NIDS) is time-intensive as it inspects all packets. A flow-based anomaly detector addresses scalability issues by monitoring only packet headers. This method is capable of detecting unknown attacks in high speed networks. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is employed in this research to detect anomalies in flow-based traffic. Metaheuristic optimization algorithms have the potential to achieve global optimal solution. In this paper, two metaheuristic algorithms, Cuckoo and PSOGSA, are examined to optimize the interconnection weights of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This optimized MLP is evaluated with two different flow-based data sets. We then compare the performance of these algorithms.

The AMCS algorithm uses an improved representation for antigens (corresponding to network access patterns) and detectors (corresponding to detection rules). In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost.

By implementing multiple aircraft in an assessment configuration, aerial monitoring and diverse sensing can be accomplished through the use of ad-hoc networking principles; aircraft act as nodes, each being a distributed agent in the network. Combined with a method called the Distributed Apt Resource Transference System (DARTS) for reallocating redundant or alternately-allocatable resources, such implementations can enjoy longer operational duration, increased coverage, and a higher probability of executing the desired reconnaissance. DARTS employs a hybridization of gossip and flooding-based resource discovery methods to find suitable replacement resources in the case of a node failure. Failures may arise due to natural (environmental) interference or malicious attacks designed to disrupt the mission. Testing of the fault-tolerant resource management techniques demonstrated resiliency of the system, resulting in minimal bandwidth requirements to reallocate (up to 6-fold reduction in traffic) and a faster speed of resource reallocation (up to 79% improvement), even in the face of an inconsistent state of operation.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is in operation in Industries, Govt. organization, Banks to guard mission critical data from fraudulent access and tempering. In recent years, with the explosion of Internet, the number of attacks in computer networks is constantly increasing. This is primarily due to the lack of proper authentication of communicating entities in the network. Moreover, the different layer of network is prone to various threats due to vulnerabilities in each of its layers. The layers are independent of each other in functionality and the lower layers provide service to the upper layers. So any compromise in a lower layer will affect all layers above it without the knowledge of the higher layers. So the attacks needs to be classified in layered fashion and their mitigation technique needs to be developed layer wise which means, modern IDS system should also needs to be designed in layered fashion.

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.",,978-1-4244-2769-7,,10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096,,Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning,graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data,Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory,,0,,23,,,March 30 2009-April 2 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

We generalize the problem of GNP with association rule mining and propose a fuzzy weighted association rule mining with GNP framework suitable for both continuous and discrete attributes.

The two most common implementations of Pattern matching are based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), which take the payload of a packet as an input string. In this paper, we propose an efficient NFA-based pattern matching in Binary Content Addressable Memory(BCAM), which uses data search words consisting of 1s and 0s. Our approach can process multiple characters at a time using limited BCAM entries, which makes our approach scalable well.

In this article, a multi-layer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system is designed and developed to achieve high efficiency and improve the detection and classification rate accuracy inspired by immune systems with negative selection approach. In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers. The obtained results demonstrated that naive bayes classifier has better classification accuracy in the case of lower presented attacks such as U2R and R2L, while the J48 decision tree classifier gives high accuracy up to 82% for DoS attacks and 65.4% for probe attacks in the anomaly traffic.",,978-1-4799-2438-7,,10.1109/HIS.2013.6920485,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920485,Artificial Immune System;Intrusion Classification;Machine Learning;Network Intrusion Detection,Niobium;Probes,Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;principal component analysis;telecommunication traffic,DoS attacks;IDS;J48 decision tree classifier;NSL-KDD benchmark data set;PCA algorithm;R2L;U2R;anomalies detection;anomalous traffic;anomaly detectors;classification approach;feature selection;genetic algorithm;immune systems;multilayer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron neural network;naive Bayes classifier;negative selection approach;normal traffic;principal component analysis algorithm;probe attacks,,1,,25,,,4-6 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

A new ensemble-feature-selection framework for intrusion detection,"Hai Thanh Nguyen; Franke, K.; Petrovic, S.","Norwegian Inf. Security Lab., Gjovik Univ. Coll., Gjovik, Norway","Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA), 2011 11th International Conference on",20120102,2011,,,213,218,"Feature selection is an important part of a pattern recognition system. A feature selection method is required to be general enough to find representative features from training data, which are then used for classifying test patterns. The situation where the features selected from the training data are quite different from the representative features of the testing data is called over-selecting. The main causes of the over-selecting phenomenon are: non-comprehensive consideration of statistical properties of the training data, heuristic search strategies for feature selection and small sample size of the data set for training. In this paper, we show the influence of the over-selecting phenomenon on the over-fitting phenomenon of machine learning algorithms. We propose a new framework to address principal causes of over-selecting and thus reduce the chance of over-fitting. Our new framework that we call Ensemble Feature Selection measure (EnFS), allows to consider many statistical properties of a given data set at the same time by combining many feature selection methods used in the filter model. From the chosen feature selection measures, a new combined measure is constructed. We also propose a new search algorithm that ensures the globally optimal feature subsets by means of the constructed measure. The new search approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming (M01LP) problem by means of the branch-and-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear in the number of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our EnFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application.

Nodes use a trust based transmission method based on previous records of successful packet transmission. Nodes which violate this relay of packets and cause denial of service attack in the form flooding of large packets may cause congestion which needs to be detected. Whenever congestion occurs then the senders should lower their transmission rate, but if certain senders do not do this, it can be found by the destination by comparing it with the previous sending rate. When both the rates are equal, the corresponding sender is considered as an attacker and has to be removed from the existing path.

ATMP has been implemented on top of TinyOS and has been tested using TOSSIM in several attack scenarios to evaluate the evolution of experience, trust and reputation.

However, to the author's knowledge, very few dynamic prioritisation metrics exist. In this paper, a new prioritisation metric - OutMet, which is based on measuring the degree to which an alert belongs to anomalous behaviour is proposed. OutMet combines alert correlation and prioritisation analysis. We illustrate the effectiveness of OutMet by testing its ability to prioritise alerts generated from a 2012 red-team cyber-range experiment that was carried out as part of the BT Saturn programme.

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions.

The covert channel leverages the differences in the framing approaches used by Ethernet and IP packets to append hidden information to IP packet and transmit it to an organization's administrator. This stealthy communication is difficult for even advanced attackers and is challenging to block since it opportunistically uses unrelated communication. Further, since the transmission is tied to the Ethernet frame, the communication cannot traverse network routers, preventing security information from leaving the organization. We introduce the covert channel, incorporate it into a working prototype, and combine it with an intrusion detection system to show its promise for security event reporting.",,978-1-4799-0458-7,,10.1109/SPW.2013.30,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565231,Covert Channels;Insider Threats;Network Security,IP networks;Monitoring;Operating systems;Organizations;Payloads;Protocols;Security,computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication network routing,Ethernet frame;IP packets;computer system;covert channels;insider threats;intrusion detection system;network communication;network routers;organization resources;security event reporting;security information;stealthy communication;suspicious activity;trusted insiders,,0,,26,,,23-24 May 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core.

The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions.

To deceive traffic shaping mechanisms or improve the security of the communications, these applications generate encrypted traffic or resort to several obfuscation techniques, making it difficult to manage this kind of traffic at the network level. In this work, we propose a method that explores transmission vulnerabilities of the encrypted traffic allowing its detection.

On the other side firewalls have optimized several times and different types have been introduced. Today by integrating NIDS and firewall a new product comes to the market, which is called IPS. IPSs protect information systems from unauthorized access, damage or disruption. They are installed on network primary point and perform deep packet inspection (6 layers) so the hardware should be fast enough to sit almost invisibly within the network. This policy requires expensive hardware which is based on multiple server processor technology. It also needs appropriate changes in network design and policies. The cost may not be so reasonable for medium and small size companies. In this paper we are going to implement some kind of integration between signature-based NIDS and packet filtering firewalls which would increase the overall security by a reasonable cost in compare with modern IPSs. We try to conclude this by optimizing snort as a famous open source NIDS with a sample firewall program in Linux which is implemented by means of IPTABLES commands.

Regrettably, current solutions are far from perfect, since they either produce a large number of false positives or they can only detect already known attacks. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving IDS performance, i.e. achieving high detection while reducing false positives. In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level.

Early Warning System for DDoS Attacking Based on Multilayer Deployment of Time Delay Neural Network,"Chang-Lung Tsai; Chang, A.Y.; Huang Ming-Szu","Dept. of Comput.

From the definition of DDoS, thousands of network attacks must initiate simultaneously and continuously to achieve a successful DDoS attacking. Therefore, almost all of the information system cannot survive as they confront the DDoS attacks. Although there are a lot of intrusion detection system (IDS) developed, preventing DDoS attack is still difficult and perplexing. In this paper, an early warning system for detecting DDoS attacking has been mounted to a traditional IDS to form a completely system. This early warning system is developed based on the rationale of time delay neural network. In the networking topology, each node is monitored with the deployment of detectors to establish a multilayer architecture. In addition, the activities of each node will be monitored by their neighboring nodes to check whether it is still survival or not mutually. After then, all of the attacking information will be collected and transferred to the expert module for integrating analysis. As those nodes dispatched on the DMZ or between the first and second layer of firewall face some attacking similar as the pattern of DDoS, the kernel expert module which dispatched behind the second firewall will take some feasible actions and initiate the defense strategies to protect the kernel information system. In the meanwhile, those failed nodes will be restarted and act as the role of vanguard to assure the networking under normal operation.",,978-1-4244-8378-5,978-0-7695-4222-5,10.1109/IIHMSP.2010.178,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636160,Denial of service;Distributed denial of service;Information security;Internet hacking;Time-delay neural network,Alarm systems;Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Nonhomogeneous media;Servers,computer network security;delays;network topology;neural nets;safety systems,DDoS attack;distributed denial of service;early warning system;information security;intrusion detection system;multilayer deployment;network attack techniques;networking topology;time delay neural network,,0,,7,,,15-17 Oct. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

We detail its characteristics and study its effects on the successful operation of a sensor network. We present state-of-the-art research for addressing wormhole related problems in wireless sensor networks and discuss the relative strengths and shortcomings of the proposed solutions. To date, most of the proposed defenses focus on preventive mechanisms that can be applied to protect sensor networks from this kind of attacks. However, no work has been published regarding the possibility of using more sophisticated methods, like intrusion detection systems, to achieve a more complete and autonomic defense mechanism against wormhole attackers.

In this work, we introduce an anomaly intrusion detection system, built on the notion of a DNA sequence or gene, which is responsible for the normal network traffic patterns. Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the “normal behavior DNA sequence” through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed. Finally, we provide the details of our FPGA implementation of the bioinformatics-based string matching technique.

Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level.

Using the concepts from one-way hashing and language-derived relevance theory, we propose five novel contributions relevant to ad-hoc communications and security: one-way cryptographic hashing as a mechanism for securely communicating in an environment where preexisting shared knowledge exists, hashed shared knowledge messages as a basis for secure formation of self-selecting subgroups and trust building, adding salt to the shared knowledge hashes to remove the static nature of common messages and defend against precomputed table attacks, integration of variable complexity hash functions to dynamically adjust hash complexity relative to message complexity, and a message integrity element based on the secrecy of the original shared knowledge within a hashed message.

It employs a sensor array that endows the platform with a spatial-resolution capability. Given the difficulty of collecting data involving animal motion, a simulation tool was created with the aid of Blender and OpenGL software that is capable of quickly generating streams of human and animal-intrusion data. The generated data was then examined to identify a suitable collection of features that are useful in classification. The features selected corresponded to parameters that model the received signal as the super-imposition of a fixed number of chirplets, an energy signature and a cross-correlation parameter. The resultant feature vector was then passed on to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear.

Many recent efforts have centred around visualising security data in a way that can better involve and support a human analyst in the network security triage process but this potentially gives rise to another complex system of analytical and visual components which need to be configured, trained and understood.

For the ease of development, complex packet processing algorithms are often implemented at the user-space level. As a result, performance benchmarks for packet processing algorithms often show a great gap when packets are input from different sources. An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated.

It is light-weight in the sense that the intrusion detection system (IDS) used for estimating the trust that one node has for another, consumes limited computational resource. Moreover, it uses only local information thereby ensuring scalability. Our light-weight IDS takes care of two kinds of attacks, namely, the blackhole attack and the grey hole attack.

Investing on intrusion prevention forbade its use for securing many networks. This study proposes a very basic way to prevent intrusions without any additional cost. Snort is a free open source IDS, which we have integrated with a Cisco router to prevent intrusions. Cisco routers are very common in today's networks. Other routers like Juniper, or even simple ADSL or SOHO routers can be used but with minor changes for the router specific configuration. As ADSL is very common nowadays, ADSL routers are present everywhere and they can easily replace the Cisco router used in this study and provide intrusion prevention capabilities for homes and businesses which otherwise are not able to afford it. Router and computer (to be used as a sensor) are fundamental components of every major network, so, the proposed system does not need any additional hardware. Snort is used as an IDS and alerts are logged to a database from where they are read and router Access Control List (ACL) rules are generated based on Snort intrusion alerts and then these ACL rules are configured on the router to block the potential intrusions. Method for removing ACL rules is also proposed, which may be required under some circumstances. In a fine tuned Snort IDS, false alarms will be minimum and most of the alerts will indicate intrusions.

Building on this platform, we then formulate a stochastic game model in which the transitions between system states are determined by the actions chosen by both players. An optimal policy-based configuration can be found by minimizing a discounted cost criterion, using an iterative method.

A Lightweight Intrusion Alert Fusion System,Sheng Wen; Yang Xiang; Wanlei Zhou,"Sch. of Inf.

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources.

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool.

For example, an attacker may send forged packets to a router with the intention of changing or corrupting the routing table, which in turn can reduce the network connectivity and degrade the router functionalities. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like firewall, authentication mechanisms and intrusion detection system (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect network connectivity offered by routers. In this paper, we propose using honeypot to protect routing protocols. Honeypot is particularly useful to attract attackers, driving them away real routers and allowing the administrators to be aware about intrusion attempts on their networks and the employed techniques that can be recent. Our solution (honeypot router) is to deploy a honeypot playing the role of a router. The honeypot is based on routing software called Quagga and other tools for traffic capture and analysis.

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors a network for precisely this purpose. IDSs fall into one of two categories: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Whereas signature-based IDSs rely upon pre-programmed matching rules designed by security experts and are therefore limited to pre-existing attacks in their coverage, anomaly-based IDSs attempt to identify normal and abnormal traffic, generally using machine learning, and therefore hold the promise of being able to identify novel attacks. Anomaly-based IDSs can be divided into IDSs that are trained online and IDSs that are trained offline. While IDSs that are trained online allow greater flexibility, such IDSs could be trained by an adversary to allow specific attacks. This work-in-progress paper proposes a methodology for protecting against the mistraining of an IDS trained online. Two IDSs begin with identical rule sets, but one is allowed to adjust its data to include online data while the other remains static.

Cyber-physical security in a substation,"Junho Hong; Stefanov, A.; Chen-Ching Liu; Govindarasu, M.","Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2012 IEEE",20121110,2012,,,1,1,"New technologies including microprocessor-based Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and standardized protocol and TCP/IP over wide area networks (WAN) are well-adopted in the substations. Remote access to IEDs or user interfaces in a substation for maintenance purposes is a common practice. However, there are potential cyber-physical system vulnerabilities in a substation, e.g., unsecured standard protocols, remote controllable IEDs, and unauthorized remote access to substation IEDs. In addition, some substation IEDs and user interfaces have a web server and hence it may provide a remote configuration change and control with default passwords. Even if firewalls and cryptography schemes are used for cyber security, weak security key management cryptography and mis-configured firewalls are still exposed to intruders. From IT point of view, cyber security issues are well known and new security technologies are available. However, security research on the integration of IT and physical power systems for critical infrastructures is still an emerging area. Intruders behaviors will generate logs across all substation-level networks, e.g., IEDs, firewalls and user interfaces. For instance, the steps of Stuxnet attack are based on: (1) intrusion attempts, (2) change of the file system, (3) change of target systems setting, and (4) change of target systems status. Therefore, anomaly detection is performed based on logs of intruders foot prints. Temporal anomaly can be determined from discrepancies between event logs from two different time periods. In the proposed anomaly index, a value of 0 implies no difference, whereas 1 indicates the maximal discrepancy [1]. In order to identify the impact of substation cyber intrusion to the power grid, cyber intrusion scenarios have been conducted on the substation IT network using a SCADA testbed at University College Dublin (UCD). The first intrusion scenario involves compromised substation gateway. A false signal is generated and - n open circuit breaker (CB) command is sent to substation CBs. The second scenario is to generate forged CB status at the gateway. As a result of this attack, control center operators will observe fake data about the CB status. However, the actual substation CBs status has not changed. The third scenario is to generate fabricated analogue values to a control center using a man-in-the-middle attack. Once an intruder successfully compromises the substation LAN, (s)he is able to monitor and capture all measured data which comes from power grids. If attackers send fabricated data to the control center and the data travel through the state estimation filter, control center operators will observe an operational emergency. As a result, the operators may take emergency control actions such as reducing the generation voltage or reactive power while the power system is actually in a normal condition. There is a possibility these (logical) actions based on fabricated data will drive the system into a sequence of cascading events, leading to a power outage. Mitigation actions are conducted on substation IT and power grid. For IT mitigation, intrusion detection system (IDS) which uses anomaly detection algorithm based on temporal event construction has been used in a substation network.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

Proposed Intrusion Detection on ZRP based MANET by effective k-means clustering method of data mining,"Sumit, S.; Mitra, D.; Gupta, D.","Dept. of CSE/IT, Manipal Univ. Jaipur, Jaipur, India","Optimization, Reliabilty, and Information Technology (ICROIT), 2014 International Conference on",20140417,2014,,,156,160,"Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) consist of peer-to-peer infrastructure less communicating nodes that are highly dynamic. As a result, routing data becomes more challenging. Ultimately routing protocols for such networks face the challenges of random topology change, nature of the link (symmetric or asymmetric) and power requirement during data transmission. Under such circumstances both, proactive as well as reactive routing are usually inefficient. We consider, zone routing protocol (ZRP) that adds the qualities of the proactive (IARP) and reactive (IERP) protocols. In ZRP, an updated topological map of zone centered on each node, is maintained. Immediate routes are available inside each zone. In order to communicate outside a zone, a route discovery mechanism is employed. The local routing information of the zones helps in this route discovery procedure. In MANET security is always an issue. It is possible that a node can turn malicious and hamper the normal flow of packets in the MANET. In order to overcome such issue we have used a clustering technique to separate the nodes having intrusive behavior from normal behavior. We call this technique as effective k-means clustering which has been motivated from k-means. We propose to implement Intrusion Detection System on each node of the MANET which is using ZRP for packet flow. Then we will use effective k-means to separate the malicious nodes from the network.

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection.

The drastic increase in network speed and detection workloads necessitates the need for highly efficient network intrusion detection systems(NIDS). Since most NIDSs need to check for a large number of known attack patterns in every packet, pattern matching becomes the most significant part of signature-based NIDSs in terms of processing and memory resources. To support segmentation of network traffic and to detect fragmented attacks, we propose a method which performs both 'partial' and 'full' pattern matching using the data structure CDAWG (Compact Direct Acyclic Word Graph). In the present work, we designed and implemented an efficient string matching algorithm using CDAWG structure.

An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis,"Xinming Ou; Rajagopalan, S.R.; Sakthivelmurugan, S.","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2009. ACSAC '09. Annual",20100115,2009,,,494,503,"Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.",1063-9527,978-0-7695-3919-5,,10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706,intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty,Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty,inference mechanisms;security of data,Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty,,3,,22,,,7-11 Dec. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats.

However, the performance comparison is difficult because there is no efficient implementation of VM introspection in KVM. In this paper, we first propose KVMonitor for efficient VM introspection in KVM. Using KVMonitor, we have ported Transcall for offloading legacy IDSes. For memory introspection, KVMonitor was 32 times faster than the existing LibVMI. Then we present performance comparison between Xen and KVM on VM introspection. The experimental results showed that checking the kernel memory with KVMonitor was 118 times faster than that in Xen. Even for legacy chkrootkit, the execution time with KVMonitor was 63% shorter than that in Xen.",,978-1-4799-6473-4,,10.1109/PRDC.2014.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974789,IDS offloading;intrusion detection systems;security;virtual machine introspection;virtualization software,Kernel;Monitoring;Registers;Servers;Virtualization,security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation,IDS offloading;KVM software;KVMonitor;Transcall;VM introspection;Xen software;intrusion detection system;legacy chkrootkit;memory introspection;virtual machines,,0,,39,,,18-21 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The problem is approached statistically, as that of sequential (quickest) changepoint detection. A multi-cyclic setting of quickest change detection is a natural fit for this problem. We propose a novel score-based multi-cyclic detection algorithm. The algorithm is based on the so-called Shiryaev-Roberts procedure. This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes. This is confirmed experimentally for real traces.

In these applications, delivering information to multiple receivers at the same time makes multicast communication is the next generation dominated data transmission mechanism in mobile ad hoc networks. In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study.

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties.

In this paper, a multilevel event correlation structure is proposed by firstly assigning each alert a value of confidence using contextual information and then correlates the preprocessed alerts based on improved temporal causal correlation combining with confidence value.

Although STP is widely used, it is still prone to many kinds of attacks that exploit the lack of security features both in basic working process and STP packet format. By exploiting STP control packet an attacker can pretend to be the new root in STP domain and perform unauthorized activities that lead to root take-over attack, STP control packet flooding, traffic redirection and so on. In this paper, a coverage based distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) has been introduced, for the detection of attacks on STP. The proposed scheme computes a set of switches in the network that can cover the STP network completely; where every switch belongs to that set is installed with a small module of IDS. This set of IDSs logically divides the STP network into a set of local zones. All the switches in a zone is directly connected to one switch installed with IDS and thus covered by at least one IDS in STP domain. Each IDS can detect and verify any exploit inside its local zone. Additionally IDSs communicate with each other so that any exploit outside the local zone of a particular IDS can also be detected and verified.

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of security threats in MANET. In particular, we examine all routing threats that can target the operation of routing protocol, whether they belong to selfish behaviors or malicious attacks, as well as countermeasures against such attacks.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731,Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine,Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput,deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching,ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching,,1,,30,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

Enforcement of network security policies to low level security mechanisms faces some essential difficulties. Consistency, verification, and maintenance are the major ones of these difficulties. One approach to overcome these difficulties is to automate the process of translation of high level security policy into low level security mechanisms. This paper introduces a framework of an automation process that translates a high level security policy into low level security mechanisms. The framework is described in terms of three phases; in the first phase all network assets are categorized according to their roles in the network security and relations between them are identified to constitute the network security model. This proposed model extends the organization based access control (OrBAC) model to include not only access control policy but also some other administrative security policies like auditing policy. Besides, it enables matching of each rule of the high level security policy with the corresponding ones of the low level security policy. Through the second phase, the high level security policy is mapped into the network security model. The second phase could be considered as a translation of the high level security policy into an intermediate model level. Finally, the intermediate model level is translated automatically into low level security mechanism.

We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds.

However, there is no study focusing on mining IP flows with high variability of attacks in an intuitive way. In this study, we leverage the visualization specialty of GHSOM to help analyze the static IP flow data, also called the network traces of victims, to identify any suspicious IP source. The GHSOM can generate a hierarchical architecture based on the input data and help reveal their inherent hierarchical relationships. For example, the geometric distances between each attack pattern and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space which forms the signature of a botnet. The IP flows clustered by GHSOM are grouped with distinctive connecting features, and the differences between each cluster are visualized with sequential time stamps which can be used to portray various attack patterns, help explore the sources of attacks and understand the behaviors of attacks.

In order to overcome this issue, we propose an extension scheme to the Watchdog IDS which enables a node to determine whether it does not overhear its next node due to packet loss issue or due to misbehavior. To reach this goal, we assume that malicious nodes drop both acknowledgements and forwarded packets with different frequencies.

It is a hard issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. This approach will be used to set the rules for Backtracking to determine the intrusion characteristics then to implement the “ Deny All except allowed” policy rules for prevention. Combination of stream processing and backtracking is used to achieve this so-called Intrusion Prevention, so that in addition to detecting the existence of intrusion we do deny of intrusion as prevention.",,978-1-4577-1545-7,,10.1109/ICDCSyst.2012.6188773,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6188773,Data Stream;Frequent pattern mining;Intrusion Prevention,Analytical models;Maintenance engineering;Real time systems,computer network security;data mining,anomaly intrusion prevention system;backtracking rule;contemporary intrusion detection system;data source;high speed processing;intrusion characteristics;massive stream data processing;network model;online frequent item sets mining;prevention policy rule;stream data mining;time-sensitive sliding window;variable arrival rate,,0,,16,,,15-16 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

To make the hardware filter simple, we use a finite-input memory machine (FIMM). To reduce the memory size of the FIMM, we introduce the parallel sieve method. The proposed method is memorybased, so it is quickly reconfigurable and dissipates lower power than a TCAM-based method. The system is implemented on the Stratix III FPGA with three off-chip SRAMs and an SDRAM, where all ClamAV 514,287 virus patterns are stored.

The DLPS is based on a content scanning engine which defines a new type of matching problem, called longest overlap matching which also exits in many other applications as a basic problem where contents are delivered by small blocks. We study the problem by comparing it with the traditional pattern matching problem in Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) whose solutions are based on finite automata. We develop a new finite automata representation called Skip-Finite Automata (Skip-FA) which detects the packets carrying sensitive information by using default transitions to implicitly track the overlapping parts between packets' payloads and sensitive files. The simulation results shows that our system achieves a matching speed of about 10B+ per memory access for small file set (>;20KB) and 100B+ per memory access for large file set (>;2500KB).

Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection).

Klaus Julisch put forward a clustering method effectual of eliminating false positives and finding root causes. But he proved that the clustering problem is unfortunately NP-complete. In this paper, an immune genetic algorithm is proposed to conquer the NP-complete clustering problem. The ad hoc strategy of generating antibodies and computing their density is proposed. The coding scheme and genetic operations including selection, crossover, and mutation are discussed in detail.

International Conference on",20090626,2009,,,1124,1129,"Testing network-based security tools such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) differs from testing ordinary network tools (e.g., routers and switches). Basically, in addition to the parameters (such as bandwidth utilization, routing information and packets timing) that are important for network tools, security tools are more sensitive to issues like traffic composition, contents, and session level parameters. Generating a realistic synthetic traffic that keeps all the characteristics of the real traffic has proved to be difficult. For this reason, security testers often use real traffic traces in their test or evaluation. However, the available traces are often limited in number or size. Therefore, it is necessary to merge and manipulate traces to create a test environment that would be representative of the operational environment, and to inject attacks into the traffic. A variety of tools for recording, replaying as well as forging packets can be obtained easily, but there exist very few tools for manipulating traces so as to modify the traffic composition from the networking viewpoint. Among them, surprisingly there is no tool for manipulating traces without destructing their security-relevant characteristics.

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.",,978-1-4577-1454-2,978-0-7695-4521-9,10.1109/ANCS.2011.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710,Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching,Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security,buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching,AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection,,0,,12,,,3-4 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Impact of Feature Reduction on the Efficiency of Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems,"El-Khatib, K","Inst. of Technol., Univ. of Ontario, Oshawa, ON, Canada","Parallel and Distributed Systems, IEEE Transactions on",20100628,2010,21,8,1143,1149,"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a major line of defense for protecting network resources from illegal penetrations. A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensuring the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability of these detectors as well as to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems consist of basic information related to the TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11-specific attacks such as deauthentication attacks or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11-specific intrusions. Our model for feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a means to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm. In the experimental section of this paper, we study the impact of the optimization of the feature set for wireless intrusion detection systems on the performance and learning time of different types of classifiers based on neural networks. Experimental results with three types of neural network architectures clearly show that the optimization of a wireless feature set has a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the intrusion detection system.",1045-9219,,,10.1109/TPDS.2009.142,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226620,Feature selection;K-means;information gain ratio;intrusion detection systems;neural networks.;wireless networks,,feature extraction;neural net architecture;optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;transport protocols;wireless LAN,MAC layer DoS attack;TCP/IP header;feature reduction;hybrid model;k means classifier;lower level protocol frames;network resources;neural network architecture;optimal set;wireless feature set;wireless intrusion detection system,,9,,26,,8/28/2009,Aug. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

An Enhanced GHSOM for IDS,"Salem, M.; Buehler, U.","Group of Network & Data Security, Univ. of Appl. Sci.

Particularly, Growing Hierarchical Self Organizing Map (GHSOM) model, as an intelligent neural network, is vital in intrusion detection system (IDS). However, it suffers from prosaic topology, adheres to random weight vectors initialization, which degrades the performance metrics. In this paper, we progressively enhance the GHSOM to present a new delicate version, named EGHSOM. It consists of a meaningful initialization process instead of random initialization, a novel splitting threshold technique to stabilize the growth topology, merging and pruning methods on neurons to settle the topology and accelerate the detection, and a classification-confidence threshold to detect unknown anomaly in computer networks. The final model is trained using real-time traffic in addition to NSL-KDD and compared with other approaches.

Extraction of fingerprint from regular expression for efficient prefiltering,Xiaofei Wang; Junchen Jiang; Wei Lin; Yi Tang; Xiaojun Wang; Bin Liu,"Sch. of Electron. Eng., Dublin City Univ., Dublin, Ireland","Communications Technology and Applications, 2009. ICCTA '09. IEEE International Conference on",20091208,2009,,,221,226,"Deep packet inspection at high speed has become extremely important due to its application in a wide range of network applications, such as network security and network monitoring. Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) uses a collection of signatures of known security threats and viruses to scan the payload of each packet. Signatures are often specified in the form of regular expressions (regex), called patterns, which are traditionally implemented as finite automata. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is fast, but requires prohibitive amounts of memory which limits their practical use. Instead of matching an incoming packet with each individual regex in a ruleset, we match the packet with a fixed substring, called fingerprint, of a regex first. Fixed string matching is faster and consumes less energy than regex matching. The fact is that if a packet does not match with the fingerprint of a regex, it will not match the regex itself. So fingerprints can be used in a prefilter engine to filter out those packets and do not match any of the fingerprints of the regex in a rule set, which represents normal non-malicious traffic. This actually reduces the number of regex rules being matched, which results in increased throughput of the NIDS. We present a weight scheme to extract a good fingerprint from a regex. A good fingerprint is the one that not only indicates the regex uniquely, but also occurs as less as possible in the matching procedure. We demonstrate how to use fingerprints for efficient prefiltering by means of Bloom filters in practice.",,978-1-4244-4816-6,978-1-4244-4817-3,10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349207,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349207,bloom filter;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;prefilter;weight scheme,Automata;Computer viruses;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Filters;Fingerprint recognition;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads,computer viruses;digital signatures;feature extraction;filtering theory;fingerprint identification;finite automata;string matching,Bloom filters;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;fingerprint extraction;fixed string matching;network intrusion detection system;network monitoring;network security;normal nonmalicious traffic;regex matching;regular expressions;ruleset;security threats,,2,2,10,,,16-18 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

They perform a wide range of important network functions, including WAN optimizations, intrusion detection systems, network and application level firewalls, etc. Depending on the processing requirement of traffic, packet processing for different traffic flows may consume vastly different amounts of hardware resources (e.g., CPU and link bandwidth). Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice.

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks.

The changes that attackers make may target any part of the filesystem, including metadata along with files (e.g., permissions, ownerships and inodes). The accuracy of detecting an intrusion depends on the data audited: if an intrusion does not manifest in the data, the intrusion will not be detected. Moreover, not all files, which contain filesystem activity, are suitable to detect intrusions, as some may fail to provide useful information.

A Multi-dimensional Progressive Perfect Hashing for High-Speed String Matching,"Yang Xu; Lei Ma; Zhaobo Liu; Chao, H.J.","ECE Dept., NYU, Brooklyn, NY, USA","Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), 2011 Seventh ACM/IEEE Symposium on",20111031,2011,,,167,177,"Aho-Corasick (AC) automaton is widely used for multi-string matching in today's Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.",,978-1-4577-1454-2,978-0-7695-4521-9,10.1109/ANCS.2011.33,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729,Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table,Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput,automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching,Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead,,1,,27,,,3-4 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Variants of malware and exploits are emerging on the global canvas at an ever-increasing rate. There is a need to automate their detection by observing their malicious footprints over network streams. In this paper we evaluate a proposed technique to measure the relative similarity or level of maliciousness between different categories of malicious network streams captured by honeynets. This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets. This technique is then evaluated using a large dataset and the correctness of the classifier is verified by using `area under the receiver operating characteristic curves'(ROC AUC) measures across various string metric-based classifiers.,1930-529X,978-1-4673-0920-2,978-1-4673-0919-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503226,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503226,,,invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence),honeynets;machine learning method;malicious footprints;malicious network streams;malware;misuse based intrusion detection system;receiver operating characteristic curves measures;security threats;string metric based classifiers,,2,,16,,,3-7 Dec. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)).

The complexity, accessibility, and openness of the Internet have served to increase the security risk of information systems tremendously. Intrusions pose a serious security risk in a network environment. The normal and the abnormal behaviors in networked computers are hard to predict, as the boundaries cannot be well defined. This prediction process usually generates false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced, where a set of fuzzy rules is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and a fuzzy inference engine can be applied over such rules to determine intrusions. This paper proposes a technique with genetic algorithm to generate fuzzy rules instead of manual design that are able to detect anomalies and some specific intrusions. Experiments were performed with DARPA data sets, during normal behavior and intrusive behavior.

The cloud service providers foresee it as a source of promising financial gains, the clients find it a convenient solution where the enterprises may get started on their computing activities without investing on the in-house facilities of hardware and software. They can outsource the computing and archiving activities to the cloud service providers (CSP) though Internet. There are many dimensions of these activities and the researchers are trying to find acceptable solutions for the industry. In this paper, we have focused on the information security issues when migrating to a cloud environment. The confidence of end user can be won partially by the guarantees of service provider and use of cryptographic techniques. It is important that the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) should be included in the models which support forensic study whenever required. It is equally important to address the issue of anti-forensic methods that the service providers may use to hide their malicious activities. Therefore the clients would like to have a better, in-depth knowledge of information management at service providers' end. For this purpose tools to probe into the cloud services are required. To elaborate on this issue we have chosen the data archiving and storage model used for medical service providers and hospitals. It is a classic test-case where Patients' history has to be maintained under the guidelines of HIPPA. The Amazon security model has been reviewed for this purpose both for archiving and disaster recovery.

Detection of Resource-Drained Attacks on SIP-Based Wireless VoIP Networks,Jin Tang; Yong Hao; Yu Cheng; Chi Zhou,"Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

As the basic SIP specifications do not require the proxy servers to track the states of established sessions, an extension header field ""Session-Expires"" has been proposed for SIP to allow the proxy server to hold resources for established sessions just within the specified periods. In this paper, we identify a novel denial of service (DoS) attack utilizing this SIP extension to drain resources of the proxy servers in wireless VoIP. In particular, by deliberately setting a large value of the ""Session-Expires'' header and then physically disconnecting from the wireless network, attackers can repeatedly hold resources of the proxy server as long as they want. Also, the low-volume nature of the attack allows it to avoid being detected by existing volume-based intrusion detection systems. As a counter-measure, we propose a robust detection scheme based on the statistical Anderson-Darling test. The key insight that leads to the scheme is the changed statistical property of the header values induced by the attack. We validate the performance through computer simulation. The scheme shows its ability to detect the attack and is even more effective when applied against the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.",1930-529X,978-1-4244-5636-9,978-1-4244-5637-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684028,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684028,,Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Robustness;Servers;Wireless networks,Internet telephony;signalling protocols;statistical testing;telecommunication security,DDoS attack;SIP-based wireless VoIP network;Session Initiation Protocol;attack detection;distributed denial of service attack;proxy server;resource-drained attack;session control;session management;session-expires;statistical Anderson-Darling test;statistical property;volume-based intrusion detection system,,2,,12,,,6-10 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Misuse detection is the most popular approach to detect intrusions, using a library of signatures to find attacks. The accuracy of the signatures is paramount for an effective IDS, still today's practitioners rely on manual techniques to improve and update those signatures. We present a system, called pSigene, for the automatic generation of intrusion signatures by mining the vast amount of public data available on attacks. It follows a four-step process to generate the signatures, by first crawling attack samples from multiple public cyber security web portals. Then, a feature set is created from existing detection signatures to model the samples, which are then grouped using a biclustering algorithm which also gives the distinctive features of each cluster. Finally the system automatically creates a set of signatures using regular expressions, one for each cluster. We tested our architecture for SQL injection attacks and found our signatures to have a True and False Positive Rates of 90.52% and 0.03%, respectively and compared our findings to other SQL injection signature sets from popular IDS and web application firewalls.

SIDAN: A tool dedicated to software instrumentation for detecting attacks on non-control-data,"Demay, J.-C.; Totel, E.; Tronel, F.","SUPELEC, Rennes, France","Risks and Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS), 2009 Fourth International Conference on",20100217,2009,,,51,58,"Anomaly based intrusion detection systems rely on the build of a normal behavior model. When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution.

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing.

On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase.

Most of works which aim to protect these components generally consist in developing protections (or countermeasures) taken one by one. But this ""countermeasure-centered"" approach drastically decreases the performances of the whole chip in terms of power and speed. Our work is complementary and consists in reorganising a given set of existing countermeasures in order to optimise both the security and the availability of the circuit without reducing its global performances. The proposed solution is based on a double-processor architecture and on mechanisms to parametrise the hardware and software countermeasures.

This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm.

Decompression-free inspection: DPI for shared dictionary compression over HTTP,"Bremler-Barr, A.; David, S.T.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Interdiscipl. Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE",20120510,2012,,,1987,1995,"Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.",0743-166X,978-1-4673-0773-4,,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576,,Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers,Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols,Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression,,2,,25,,,25-30 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets.

Based on the observation that signature patterns are constructed from combinations of a limited number of primary patterns, we propose to decompose the Snort signature patterns. These smaller primary pattern sets can be stored along with their associations to allow dynamic signature pattern reconstruction. Not only does the matching operation potentially become more scalable, but the real time online updating task is simplified.

However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection.

Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems either focus on just one layer of observation or use a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. This paper describes a synergistic approach of fusing decisions of whether an attack takes place by using multiple measurements from different layers of wireless communication networks. The described method is implemented on a live system that monitors a wireless network in real time and gives an indication of whether a malicious frame exists or not. This is achieved by analysing specific metrics and comparing them against historical data. The proposed system assigns for each metric a belief of whether an attack takes place or not. The beliefs from different metrics are fused with the Dempster-Shafer technique with the ultimate goal of limiting false alarms by combining beliefs from various network layers.

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training.

Unfortunately, the amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Several feature selection and feature extraction techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of data. Few are focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the finding of that finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. A new hybrid algorithm MID-PCA combining PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance - MID evaluation criteria) is proposed. PCA is first applied to the original dataset. Then, mRMR-MID is applied to the intermediary output to further reduce redundancy and maximize relevancy. An exhaustive evaluation of the MID-PCA algorithm is conducted with the KDD Cup'99, a used widely dataset in the network security community. MID-PCA performance was compared to that of PCA and mRMR using two classifiers namely J48 (C4.5) and BayesNet. Experimental results assert the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm MID-PCA for NIDS feature extraction compared with PCA and Mutual Information. The newly proposed MID-PCA shows better performance and classification accuracies with reduced datasets of only 4 dimensions for BayesNet (99.77%) and 6 dimensions for J48 (99.94%). This is an improvement over PCA which achieves similar classification accuracy with 12 principal components (twelve dimensions).

To be highly effective, NIDS must perform packet inspection of incoming traffic at or near wire speed. Failing to do so will allow malicious packets to sneak through the network undetected, and thus jeopardising network security. Snort is one of the most popular IDS and intrusion prevention system (IPS) applications. Snort is a publicly available open-source NIDS application that typically runs on Linux. In this study, the authors present and discuss the essential software components of Snort and its underlying Linux support architecture. The authors characterise Snort execution and present an analytical queuing model to give insight into understanding the kernel and Snort behaviour as well as to identify key-dominating factors that strongly influence and impact Snort performance. The authors demonstrate that the current default configurations of the packet reception mechanism of the Linux networking subsystem (a.k.a. NAPI) are not suitable for Snort performance and show that the performance of Snort can be improved significantly by tuning certain configuration parameters, specifically by having a small NAPI budge value of 2. The performance is measured in terms of throughput and packet loss. The authors also measure the packet loss encountered at the kernel level as well as the interrupt rate of incoming traffic.

However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host. In this paper, we propose VMCoupler for enabling co-migration of offloaded IDSes and their target VM. Our approach is running offloaded IDSes in a special VM called a guard VM, which can monitor the internals of the target VM using VM introspection. VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination. The migration processes of these two VMs are synchronized so that the target VM does not run without being monitored.

In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others.

These shared resources, easy accessibility and shared storage of resources are responsible for putting the confidential information under a great deal of risk. Although the cloud is becoming gigantic day by day but its efficiency is being hampered considerably due to the threats in the cloud computing environment. The threats in the cloud computing environment not only account to external attacks which are launched with the intention of hampering work flow of the cloud provider but the internal attacks also which are being launched so that the efficiency and the reliability of the cloud is at stake. The firewalls monitor traffic between networks such that all the traffic must flow through it, but they are certainly not sufficient to shield the dynamic cloud computing environment from all attacks. They may be able to subvert external attacks to a certain extent but internal attacks do not even pass through the firewalls, therefore rendering them useless. Moreover, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the virtual machines in order to set up large scale attacks like Ddos. They compromise these VM's into zombies and the detection of these VM's is very difficult because cloud users install all types of applications onto their VM's some of which may be malicious. Thus, the cloud needs stronger security for handling all the intrusions of every scale.

An extension of Dempster-Shafer's theory is used to combine multiple such evidences and an initial belief is computed. First level inferences are made about the transaction depending on this initial belief.

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine.

This paper concerns using Computational intelligence based learning machines for intrusion detection in hierarchical order of attacking scenarios, which is a problem of general interest to transportation infrastructure protection since a necessary task thereof is to protect the computers responsible for the infrastructure's operational control, and an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy.

We use the multi-agent paradigm to model the proposed distributed system. In this system, an agent, which plays several roles, is situated on each node of the net. The first role of an agent is to perform the work of a local intrusion detection system (IDS). Periodically, it proceeds to exchange security data within its local neighbouring. The agent neighbouring consists of IDS agents of local neighbour nodes. The goal of such an approach is to consolidate the decision, regarding every suspected security event. Unlike previous works having proposed distributed systems for intrusion detection, our system is not restricted to data sharing. It proceeds in the case of a conflict to a negotiation between neighbouring agents in order to produce a consensual decision. So, the proposed system is fully distributed. It does not require any central or hierarchical control, which compromises its scalability, specially in wide area networks such as Internet.

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.",0733-8716,,,10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778,Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion,Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management,finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data,Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton,,0,,25,,9/19/2014,Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,

The gait characteristic of a normal walker in the nature state is an average gait period of 1.2s, in which a step period is about 0.6s and a foot touchdown time is about 0.2s. When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s. It is included in the vibration signal caused by a walking intruder inevitably. So the detection system output signal caused by a human intrusion is intermittent and periodical. If a sensing system output waveform has a period of 0.3–0.75s and a duration time of 0.15–0.25s, the disturbance source can be adjudged as a human intrusion, not as an animal or other random one.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system.

Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace.

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data.

Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels.

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.",1063-6692,,,10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409,Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM),Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput,content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures,TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces,,0,,37,,7/22/2013,Jun-14,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,
Cooperative cross layer detection for blackhole attack in VANET-OLSR,"Baiad, R.; Otrok, H.; Muhaidat, S.; Bentahar, J.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

In the literature, watchdog model was proposed to detect network related attacks. However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate.

A novel technique for congestion avoidance/control in high speed multimedia networks using Network Intrusion Detection systems,"Uma, S.V.; Gurumurthy, K.S.","Dept. of ECE, Bangalore Univ., Bangalore, India",TENCON 2013 - 2013 IEEE Region 10 Conference (31194),20140123,2013,,,1,6,"Recent expansion of the computer networks has opened a possibility of explosive spread of computer viruses. Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.

To generalize the problem, the game data are assumed not to be fully known to the players, who take a robust optimization approach to address this data uncertainty. For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated. Equilibrium analysis reveals how the conflicting objectives of the intruder and intrusion detection system compel them to adopt different conservative stances toward data uncertainty.

Robust and Fast Pattern Matching for Intrusion Detection,"Namjoshi, K.; Narlikar, G.","Bell Labs., Alcatel-Lucent, Paris, France","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE",20100506,2010,,,1,9,"The rule language of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a critical role in its effectiveness. A rule language must be expressive, in order to describe attack patterns as precisely as possible. It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.",0743-166X,978-1-4244-5836-3,,10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149,,Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness,backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data,Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language,,4,1,36,,,14-19 March 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.",,,,10.1109/SRDS.2014.28,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400,Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication,Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols,cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery,ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services,,0,,40,,,6-9 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

ARES '10 International Conference on",20100325,2010,,,17,24,"The quality of the feature selection algorithm is one of the most important factors that affects the effectiveness of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested.

So, online measurement of these network performance metrics itself acts as an Intrusion detection system. The anomalies are the inference for network security analyst to suspect whether the network is under attack or not. Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack.

However, combining many regex patterns into a single DFA causes a serious state explosion. Partitioning the pat-tern set into several subsets, each of which produces a small DFA, is a practical way to deflate the state explosion. In this paper, we propose a regex pattern grouping scheme based on a new DFA model called Pattern-Based DFA (P-DFA) which supports efficient pattern-based op-erations, such as insertion, deletion, and etc. By using these basic operations, one can easily measure the state explo-sion when combining a set of regex patterns into a single DFA.

Since data are highly sensitive, organizations are reluctant to share them. In many organizations, the security team who can collect such data is not willing to share them even within the organization. The University of Maryland (UMD) plays a significant role in cybersecurity research due to a collaboration between the Office of Information Technologys (OIT) security team and UMD researchers. The result of the collaboration is access to and analysis of all security related data collected on UMD networks. The talk will review some studies conducted using the data provided by OIT. First, organizations face increasing challenges in addressing and preventing computer and network security incidents. Being able to understand and predict trends in incidents can aid an organizations ability to allocate resources for the prevention of such incidents, as well as the evaluation of mitigation strategies. We compared non-homogeneous Poisson process software reliability growth models and time series models with a large set of security incident data. Based on the over 12,000 incidents recorded since 2001, these models were compared for their prediction capability for the number of incidents. Second, security administrators lack network visibility, i.e., they often do not have the tools to monitor their networks in detail. Even though about 40,000 IP addresses are linked to UMD users, the UMD network consists of more than 130,000 IP addresses. We developed a tool called Nfsight that identifies clients, servers, and scanners solely based on network flows. Various heuristics have been applied and combined using a Bayesian method.

Towards dynamic self-tuning for intrusion detection systems,"Sun-il Kim; Nwanze, N.; Kintner, J.","Electr. & Comput. Syst. Eng., Univ. of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, AK, USA","Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC), 2010 IEEE 29th International",20110106,2010,,,17,24,"Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems pattern the normal activity and are attractive in that new, never-seen attacks can be detected. In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.",1097-2641,978-1-4244-9330-2,,10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339,anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security,Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data,security of data;statistical analysis,alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change,,0,,15,,,9-11 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

We propose the notion of database response policies to support our intrusion response system tailored for a DBMS. Our interactive response policy language makes it very easy for the database administrators to specify appropriate response actions for different circumstances depending upon the nature of the anomalous request. The two main issues that we address in context of such response policies are that of policy matching, and policy administration. For the policy matching problem, we propose two algorithms that efficiently search the policy database for policies that match an anomalous request. We also extend the PostgreSQL DBMS with our policy matching mechanism, and report experimental results. The experimental evaluation shows that our techniques are very efficient. The other issue that we address is that of administration of response policies to prevent malicious modifications to policy objects from legitimate users. We propose a novel Joint Threshold Administration Model (JTAM) that is based on the principle of separation of duty. The key idea in JTAM is that a policy object is jointly administered by at least k database administrator (DBAs), that is, any modification made to a policy object will be invalid unless it has been authorized by at least k DBAs.

In this paper, we address these two issues of Accuracy and Efficiency using Conditional Random Fields and Layered Approach. We demonstrate that high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using Conditional Random Fields and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach. Experimental results on the benchmark KDD '99 intrusion data set show that our proposed system based on Layered Conditional Random Fields outperforms other well-known methods such as the decision trees and the naive Bayes. The improvement in attack detection accuracy is very high, particularly, for the U2R attacks (34.8 percent improvement) and the R2L attacks (34.5 percent improvement).

Without loss of generality, feature selection can effectively improve the classification model performance, study on the feature selection-based intrusion detection method is therefore very necessary. This paper proposes a simple and quick inconsistency-based feature selection method. Data inconsistency is firstly employed to find the optimal features, and the sequential forward search is then utilized to facilitate the selection of subset features.

Generally R2L and U2R attacks are very rare attacks and even in KDD Cup99 dataset, these attacks are only 2% of overall datasets. So, these result in model not able to efficiently learn the characteristics of rare categories and this will result in poor detection rates of rare attack categories like R2L and U2R attacks. We introduce a new approach called cascading classification model based on AdaBoost and Bayesian Network Classifier that can improve the detection rate of rare network attack categories. In this approach we train two classifiers with two different training sets. The KDD Cup99 dataset was splitted into two training sets where one contains full of non rare attacks datasets and other contains datasets of rare attack categories.

Features Selection for Intrusion Detection Systems Based on Support Vector Machines,"Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON","Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, 2009.

These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most tested and reliable technologies to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks. It is critical to implement network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic and high-speed connectivity. Due to the fact that software NIDSs are still unable to detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks (UDP, TCP, ICMP and HTTP) or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DoS/DDoS), because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or slow down the performance of systems. Here we have designed a suitable real network to present experiments that use Snort NIDSs to demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDSs, such as its inability to process multiple packets at high speeds and its propensity to drop packets without analysing them. This paper outlines Snort NIDSs' failures in high-speed and heavy traffic and its propensity to drop more packets as the speed and volume of traffic increase. We ran some consecutive tests to analyse the Snort performance using the number of packets received, the number of packets analysed, the number of packets filtered and the number of packets dropped.

Wireless sensor networks have been used in military applications, environmental monitoring applications, healthcare applications, and even home applications. An adversary may want to disrupt these sensor networks for various reasons. Adversaries range from a hacker with a laptop to corporations and governments who have a vested interest in compromising the proper operation of an unwelcome sensor network. Since sensor nodes are small and usually placed in uncontrolled environments, they are susceptible to capture and reprogramming by an adversary. The low-power nature of sensor nodes make traditional strong encryption approaches to network security infeasible as nodes have limited processing power and sometimes significant energy constraints. This paper presents work in progress on developing a system which would protect a wireless sensor network from denial-of-service attacks after one or more nodes on the network have been captured and reprogrammed by an adversary. This system removes the need to rely on tamper proof packaging to protect the cryptographic keys and other sensitive data which is stored on nodes.

Different methods and algorithms are developed and proposed in recent years to improve intrusion detection systems. The most important issue in current systems is that they are poor at detecting novel anomaly attacks. These kinds of attacks refer to any action that significantly deviates from the normal behaviour which is considered intrusion. This paper proposed a model to improve this problem based on data mining techniques. Apriori algorithm is used to predict novel attacks and generate real-time rules for firewall. Apriori algorithm extracts interesting correlation relationships among large set of data items. This paper illustrates how to use Apriori algorithm in intrusion detection systems to cerate a automatic firewall rules generator to detect novel anomaly attack.

However, signature matching has become a key limiting factor to restrict the performance of a signature-based NIDS in large-scale distributed network environment. The overhead network packets can greatly reduce the effectiveness of such detection systems and heavily consume computer resources. To mitigate this issue, a more efficient signature matching algorithm is desirable. In this paper, we therefore develop an adaptive character frequency-based exclusive signature matching scheme that can be implemented in a signature-based NIDS to help improve the performance of signature matching. In the experiment, we implemented our scheme in a distributed network environment and evaluated the performance of our scheme compared with Snort.

One of the most important applications of wireless networks is Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) in which all the nodes work as both transmitter and receiver. MANETs are used in various fields like military, industry and emergency recovery. So it is important to have a firsthand knowledge about MANETs.

Traditionally, the approach taken to find attacks is to inspect the contents of every packet. However, packet inspection cannot easily be performed at high-speeds. Therefore, researchers and operators started investigating alternative approaches, such as flow-based intrusion detection. In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed. The concept of flows is explained, and relevant standards are identified.

Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier.

The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes.

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal.

Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks.

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.",,978-1-4244-9905-2,,10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393,CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic,Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing,Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines,CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation,,1,,18,,,11-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Packet classification systems have traditionally been built utilizing Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) due to the high throughput needed. However, TCAMs are expensive in terms of area and power consumption. An alternative to TCAM based systems using SRAM and a novel rule encoding method has been proposed to match multiple packets simultaneously (using multiple store_compare_units). This alternative achieves similar or better throughput than the traditional TCAM approach while occupying smaller space and consuming less energy. This paper revamps the existing SRAM-based architecture to reduce area and power consumption without threatening throughput. Two methods are shown. The first method allows for range encoding SRAMs to be shared between store_compare_units (SCUs) to lower area and power consumption with minor effect on throughput. The second method discusses a hybrid system allowing rules with prefixes (single rules) and ranges (rules which match a range of addresses, usually translated to many prefixes) to exist in parallel for the same domain. This allows for lower power consumption than utilizing fixed range encoding due to optimization of the ruleset. Results show that this hybrid architecture saves more than 20% of power/field if half of the TCP ports contain ranges (and the other half contains prefixes).

In our architecture, there is the possibility to apply various types of reactions. Since real time reaction is very important for overall performance, and decision making for this type of reaction highly depends on attack type, in this paper we experiment the attack classification part of our design over labeled KDD'99 dataset by attack types. Results show that our used approach has 98.0484 % accuracy of attack classification in reasonable speed.",,978-1-4673-2072-6,,10.1109/ISTEL.2012.6483125,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483125,NIDPS;alert;correlation;decision;design;engine;infer;prevention;reaction;response,Accuracy;Correlation;Decision making;Engines;Intrusion detection;Ontologies,decision making;security of data,anomaly based intrusion detection;attack classification;decision engine;decision making;hybrid network intrusion detection;hybrid network intrusion prevention;input alerts;labeled KDD'99 dataset;meta alert;misuse based intrusion detection;parallel hybrid architecture;real time reaction,,0,,39,,,6-8 Nov. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.",,,,10.1109/PRDC.2013.46,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872,,Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software,authorisation;safety-critical software,FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity,,0,,19,,,2-4 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a Â¿gray boxÂ¿ since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned.

Thus, a high-performance signature matching scheme is of great importance for a signature-based IDS. In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud.

Therefore a need for Intrusion Detection Networks arises. Collaborators could be used here to enhance the detection of attacks. But still this concept suffers from lack of trustworthiness in the distributed environment. We introduce Mobile Agents (MA) to handle this problem effectively. A DCE - TRUST architecture is proposed where MAs are used to migrate from one node to another autonomously within the range of collaborators in and out of each network to inform them about the detected intrusions accurately and in a timely manner.

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior.

Recently, several machine learning techniques have been proposed to automate and develop intelligent network forensics systems. An intelligent network forensics system that reconstructs intrusion scenarios and makes attack attributions requires knowledge about intrusions signatures, evidences, impacts, and objectives. In addition, problem solving knowledge that describes how the system can use domain knowledge to analyze malicious activities is essential for the design of intelligent network forensics systems. In this paper we adapt recent researches in semantic-web, information architecture, and ontology engineering to design a method ontology for network forensics analysis. The proposed ontology represents both network forensics domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge.

Modern ID techniques must cope with increasingly sophisticated attacks as well as rapidly rising network line speeds. Signature based ID is forced to sample sparsely, increasing the likelihood of malicious traffic entering the network without scrutiny. Con sequently, flow-based ID is gaining attention as an effective complement. ID systems are furthermore often characterized as either network-based or host-based. The autonomous multi agent design paradigm is a scalable, attractive alternative for its potential to leverage the strengths of both architectures: the broad perspective and visibility into distributed malicious activity provided by network-based ID, and the comprehensive view of the local node provided by host-based ID. This paper therefore develops an architecture for a new multi agent, flow-based intrusion detection sysem. The architecture is designed in two iterations of increasing complexity. These innovative ID designs use a ""repuation"" system to permit agents to dynamically find nodes that are most effective for classifying malicious network activity.

To achieve this goal each of the stored signatures represents a description of an attack or an undesired event in the monitored network. The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures.

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications.

However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue.

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources.

Different intrusion detection techniques can be employed to search for attack patterns in the observed data. Misuse detection and anomaly detection are the most commonly used techniques. But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naïve bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced.

The reduction algorithm is presented to cancel the redundant attribute set and obtain the optimal attribute set to form the input of the FCM. To find the reasonable initial centers easily, the advanced FCM is established, which improves the performance of intrusion detection since the traffic is large and the types of attack are various.

However, whether for selfish or malicious reasons, a node may fail to cooperate during the network operations or even attempt to disturb them, both of which have been recognized as misbehaviors. Various trust management schemes have been studied to assess the behaviors of nodes so as to detect and mitigate node misbehaviors inMANETs. Most of existing schemes model a node's trustworthiness along a single dimension, combining all of the available evidence to calculate a single, scalar trust metric. A single measure, however, may not be expressive enough to adequately describe a node's trustworthiness in many scenarios. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of MANET node from multiple perspectives. Our scheme evaluates trustworthiness from three perspectives: collaboration trust, behavioral trust, and reference trust. Different types of observations are used to independently derive values for these three trust dimensions.

In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.",,978-1-4673-6320-4,,10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581,,Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training,Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection,Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction,,0,,20,,,19-21 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Cyber Security and Operational Reliability,"Meliopoulos, S.; Cokkinides, G.; Beyah, R.; Walters, S.; Myrda, P.",,"System Sciences (HICSS), 2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on",20150330,2015,,,2655,2663,"This paper presents a new proposed infrastructure that enables simultaneous cyber security and operational security. The basis of the method is command interception and fast authentication from the cyber security point of view (reliable detection of cyber intrusions) and from the operational reliability point of view. To simplify the process, the command authentication is done at the relay level and relay controls. As such it does not depend on the communication architecture. The method is based on new developments on dynamic state estimation based protection and substation level distributed state estimation. This infrastructure provides the capability to monitor, intercept, and authenticate/block commands as they reach the relay and the control circuits of the relay. Since all controls are exercise through a relay, this approach provides 100% coverage. The authentication/blockage of commands is done quickly because of the distributed approach which enables quick assembly of a local real time model and fast analytics with this local model. Specifically, for each command the proper local real time model is constructed and quickly analyzed to determine the effects on the power system. The analytics determine the effect of the command, if executed, on the system and in particular on the operational reliability of the system. In case of a command that may have adverse effects on the operational reliability of the system, the command will be blocked and the operator will be alerted. In addition to the command authentication at the relay level, an open-source real-time network monitoring system for capturing and parsing network traffic is presented. Because the method is based on the substation level dynamic state estimator which uses only local substation level measurements and data, a byzantine type attack is not considered possible for the proposed approach. Finally, a discussion on the architecture required to integrate the network monitoring and state estimation sys- ems is presented. The methodology is presently being tested in a laboratory setup that includes a digital simulator of the electric power system and hardware in the loop.",1530-1605,,,10.1109/HICSS.2015.320,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070135,Dynamic State Estimation;PMU;Protection,Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Relays;State estimation;Substations,power engineering computing;power system management;power system reliability;public domain software;real-time systems;security of data;state estimation,command authentication;command interception;cyber intrusions;cyber security;dynamic state estimation;electric power system;fast authentication;hardware in the loop;open-source real-time network monitoring system;operational reliability;operational security;substation level distributed state estimation,,0,,19,,,5-8 Jan. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information.

Since the nodes communicate with each other, they cooperate by forwarding data packets to other nodes in the network. Thus the nodes find a path to the destination node using routing protocols. However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Sinking Behaviour and Collision Behaviour Attack against network integrity absorbing all data packets in the network.

But the suffering problem of these systems is that a large amount of non-critical alarms will be generated during the detection process which increase the analysis burden and lower the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems in real deployment. We argue that this bottleneck stems primarily from the lack of information related to the actual settings. To mitigate this limitation, we advocate that the way of combining intrusion detection signatures with contextual information is a promising and effective solution. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the construction of contextual signatures in intrusion detection systems by means of hash function to identify and filter out non-critical alarms.

A circular chain intrusion detection for cloud computing based on improved AdjointVM approach,"Oktay, U.; Aydin, M.A.; Sahingoz, O.K.","Turkish Air Force Acad.

Although it offers tremendous opportunities, there are some major challenges, such as security, that must be solved for efficient usage. Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex).",,978-1-4799-0194-4,,10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705192,AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine,Cloud computing;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization,cloud computing;computer centres;data privacy;security of data;trusted computing,AdjointVM approach;capex;capital expenditure;circular chain intrusion detection;cloud computing;confidentiality;data centers;information security;protection architecture defenselessness;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees,,1,,17,,,19-21 Nov. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision.

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.",,978-1-4244-8484-3,978-0-7695-4159-4,10.1109/NSS.2010.62,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554,Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis,Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers,cryptographic protocols;digital signatures,anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods,,3,,23,,,1-3 Sept. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

On each node, the defender can choose one of several security modes available.

In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI.

Centroid-Based Nearest Neighbor Feature Representation for E-Government Intrusion Detection,Chih-Fong Tsai; Jung-Hsiang Tsai; Jui-Sheng Chou,"Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat. Central Univ., Jungli, Taiwan","World Telecommunications Congress (WTC), 2012",20120315,2012,,,1,6,"Accompanied by the invention of information and communication of technologies, e-government has become a prominent feature of modern governance in every country. The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.",,978-1-4577-1459-7,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432,,Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training,Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing,CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs,,1,,18,,,5-6 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm.

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

Along with cloud computing, many related problems come up. And these problems in turn slow the speed of the development of cloud computing down. Among these problems, e.g. interoperability and privacy, identity management and security are strong concerned. Many researchers and enterprises have already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy.

Detecting distributed signature-based intrusion: The case of multi-path routing attacks,"Jiefei Ma; Le, F.; Russo, A.; Lobo, J.",,"Computer Communications (INFOCOM), 2015 IEEE Conference on",20150824,2015,,,558,566,"Signature-based network intrusion detection systems (S-IDS) have become an important security tool in the protection of an organisation's infrastructure against external intruders. By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.",,,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423,,Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization,computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic,asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate,,0,,21,,,April 26 2015-May 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Therefore, the contradictory requirements of immediate node failure notification and infrequent analyzer status variation should be both considered. In this contribution, we designed one heartbeat protocol with four variations in publish-subscribe framework.

In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks.

We need to find new mechanisms to protect the wireless networks from attacks. In this paper we develop a scheme for malicious node detection based on weighted-trust evaluation. A weight value is assigned to each sensor node initially. It updates every cycle if the node sends different report from the others. A malicious node will be detected when its weight value is lower than a threshold value.

In addition nodes or groups of nodes may defect, which is a particular concern in coalition environments where networks may spread beyond organizational boundaries. To identify defecting or compromised nodes including Byzantine behavior we propose a clustered intrusion detection architecture.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset.

As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications.

Through the frequent transmission of beacons containing pseudonyms and telematic data like speed, acceleration and location of the vehicles, attackers are able to track VANET users. To address this problem, several privacy concepts have been proposed in the past to protect the participants.

There are a wide variety of attacks possible in networked machines. DOS attack, buffer overflow attack, cross site attack, DNS exploit attack are a few to name. Without security measures and controls in place, network and data might be subjected to attacks. The commonly deployed security devices are firewall, IDS, IPS, anti-virus etc. Potential number of threats is still pervading which are formulated as attacks by combining many unnoticed primitive events. The best solution is to install a Complex Event Processing (CEP) system which can analyze multiple devices to infer attack patterns. Log information of network devices is the best choice for analysis. In a large network, there will be millions of events logged. Correlated analysis of this huge volume of log is the main challenge in Complex Event Processing (CEP) system. We describe a method to reduce the input to the Complex Event Processing (CEP) system, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Our experiment shows that the input size can be considerably reduce using the classifier.

We propose a novel architecture to identify users of encrypted traffic in a network environment of a company. It is based on statistical evaluation of monitored network packets.

Studies have shown that flow-based anomaly detection mechanisms give promising results as compared to typical signature based attack detection mechanisms which have not been able to detect such attacks effectively. For this purpose, a variety of flow-based DDoS detection algorithms have been put forward. We have divided the flow-based DDoS attack detection techniques broadly into two categories namely, packet header based and mathematical formulation based. Analyses has been done for two techniques one belonging to each category. The paper has analyzed and evaluated these with respect to their detection accuracy and capability.

A First Step Toward Network Security Virtualization: From Concept To Prototype,Seungwon Shin; Haopei Wang; Guofei Gu,"Korea Adv.

A grand challenge in this situation is that current management is inflexible and the security resource utilization is not efficient. The flexible deployment and utilization of proper security devices at reasonable places at needed time with low management cost is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new concept of network security virtualization, which virtualizes security resources/functions to network administrators/users, and thus maximally utilizing existing security devices/middle-boxes. In addition, it enables security protection to desirable networks with minimal management cost. To verify this concept, we further design and implement a prototype system, NETSECVISOR, which can utilize existing pre-installed (fixed-location) security devices and leverage software-defined networking technology to virtualize network security functions. At its core, NETSECVISOR contains: 1) a simple script language to register security services and policies; 2) a set of routing algorithms to determine optimal routing paths for different security policies based on different needs; and 3) a set of security response functions/strategies to handle security incidents. We deploy NETSECVISOR in both virtual test networks and a commercial switch environment to evaluate its performance and feasibility. The evaluation results show that our prototype only adds a very small overhead while providing desired network security virtualization to network users/administrators.",1556-6013,,,10.1109/TIFS.2015.2453936,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152892,Security;Software-Defined Networking;Virtualization;software-defined networking;virtualization,Communication networks;Monitoring;Prototypes;Routing;Security;Switches;Virtualization,computer network management;computer network security;software defined networking;virtualisation,NETSECVISOR prototype system;commercial switch environment;first step toward network security virtualization;fixed-location security devices;low management cost;network security devices;network security management;security policy;security protection;security resource utilization;security response functions;software-defined networking technology;virtual test networks,,0,,37,,7/8/2015,Oct. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,,
