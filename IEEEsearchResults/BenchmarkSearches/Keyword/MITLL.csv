SSENet-2011: A Network Intrusion Detection System dataset and its comparison with KDD CUP 99 dataset,"Vasudevan, A.R.; Harshini, E.; Selvakumar, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Nat. Inst. of Technol. Tiruchirappalli, Tiruchirappalli, India","Internet (AH-ICI), 2011 Second Asian Himalayas International Conference on",20111229,2011,,,1,5,"In recent years the attack vectors in the network world have increased many fold with the increased usage of Internet and with the exponential growth of various applications. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset. From the experiments it is evident that a closed and secluded network such as SSENet and Tstat tool help researchers in developing and analyzing a new dataset which reflects the changing scenario of network activities.",2157-0647,978-1-4577-1087-2,,10.1109/AHICI.2011.6113948,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113948,Feature Construction;NIDS;SSENet-2011;Tstat,Business;Complexity theory;Fires;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Silicon;Vectors,Internet;security of data,Internet;KDD CUP 99 dataset;NIDS;SSENet-2011;data mining;evolutionary algorithms;machine learning;network intrusion detection system;security experts,,2,,7,,,4-6 Nov. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Developing a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System Using Data Mining for Power Systems,"Pan, S.; Morris, T.; Adhikari, U.",", Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA","Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on",20151019,2015,6,6,3104,3113,"Synchrophasor systems provide an immense volume of data for wide area monitoring and control of power systems to meet the increasing demand of reliable energy. The construction of traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that use manually created rules based upon expert knowledge is knowledge-intensive and is not suitable in the context of this big data problem. This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs. As a proof of concept, an IDS prototype was implemented and validated. The IDS prototype accurately classifies disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks for the distance protection scheme for a two-line three-bus power transmission system.",1949-3053,,,10.1109/TSG.2015.2409775,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063234,Cyber-attacks;data mining;distance protection;intrusion detection system (IDS);power system;synchrophasor system,Data mining;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Power transmission lines;Transmission line measurements,,,,1,,,,3/18/2015,Nov. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
Hybrid rule mining based on fuzzy GNP and probabilistic classification for intrusion detection,"Nannan Lu; Mabu, S.; Wenjing Li; Hirasawa, K.","Grad. Sch. of Inf., Waseda Univ., Fukuoka, Japan","SICE Annual Conference 2010, Proceedings of",20101014,2010,,,2614,2619,"With increasing Internet popularity, network security has become a serious problem recently. Therefore, a variety of algorithms have been devoted to this challenge. Genetic Network Programming is a newly developed evolutionary algorithm with directed graph gene structures, which has been applied to data mining for intrusion detection systems and has shown that it provides good performances in intrusion detection. In this paper, a hybrid rule mining algorithm based on Fuzzy GNP and probabilistic classification has been proposed. Hybrid rule mining uses fuzzy class association rule mining algorithm to extract rules with different classes. Then, using different class rules and the classification of data is done probabilistically. The hybrid methods showed excellent results by the simulation experiments.",,978-1-4244-7642-8,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5602487,Fuzzy GNP;Fuzzy class association rule;Genetic Network Programming;Hybrid rule;Intrusion detection;Probabilistic classification,Accuracy;Association rules;Databases;Economic indicators;Intrusion detection;Probabilistic logic,data mining;directed graphs;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;probability;security of data,directed graph gene structures;evolutionary algorithm;fuzzy GNP;genetic network programming;hybrid rule mining;intrusion detection;probabilistic classification,,0,,10,,,18-21 Aug. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
