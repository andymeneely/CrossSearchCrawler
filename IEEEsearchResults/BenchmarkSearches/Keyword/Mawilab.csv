DoS and port scan attack detection in high speed networks,"Hasanifard, M.; Ladani, B.T.","Dept. Of Comput. Eng., Univ. of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran","Information Security and Cryptology (ISCISC), 2014 11th International ISC Conference on",20141222,2014,,,61,66,"One of the necessities of high-speed Internet highways is the use of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). To this end, IDS should be able to process a high volume of traffic with limited resources. IDSs have improved significantly in recent years and they showed acceptable outcomes. However, there is no appropriate solution for high-speed networks. This paper proposes a solution for diagnosing denial of service (DoS) and port scan attacks as a layer of defense. The proposed method attains high speed rate using a parallel data structure to filter out DoS and port scan attacks from network traffic before entering the intrusion detection system. Attack filtering is based on statistical anomaly detection. The experimental results from implementing and evaluating the proposed method show acceptable records in both error rate and speed.",,,,10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994023,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994023,Data stream computing;Denial of service attack;Intrusion detection system;Port scan attack;Statistical anomaly detection,Computer crime;Data structures;Feature extraction;High-speed networks;IP networks;Ports (Computers);Servers,Internet;computer network security;data structures;parallel processing;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic,DoS;IDS;attack filtering;denial of service attack;high speed networks;high-speed Internet highways;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;parallel data structure;port scan attack detection;statistical anomaly detection,,0,,16,,,3-4 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Sketch-based multidimensional IDS: A new approach for network anomaly detection,"Callegari, C.; Casella, A.; Giordano, S.; Pagano, M.; Pepe, T.","Dept. of Inf. Eng., Univ. of Pisa, Pisa, Italy","Communications and Network Security (CNS), 2013 IEEE Conference on",20131212,2013,,,350,358,"The diffusion of technologies for high speed data transmission over the Internet and the growing employment of new multimedia services require fast and effective techniques for the protection against network attacks. In this paper we present a new approach able to detect at the same time different types of network anomalies. It consists in the simultaneous analysis of several traffic descriptors (aggregated through a sketch to guarantee the scalability of the algorithm) by means of a single vectorial algorithm. In terms of ROC curve, the performance of our multidimensional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are comparable with the separate application of traditional monodimensional IDSs to all traffic parameters, while reducing the computational time of more than 80%.",,,,10.1109/CNS.2013.6682725,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682725,,Conferences;Data models;Euclidean distance;Kernel;Probability density function;Security;Vectors,Internet;security of data;sensitivity analysis;telecommunication traffic;vectors,Internet;ROC curve;high speed data transmission;multidimensional intrusion detection system;multimedia services;network anomalies;network attacks protection;single vectorial algorithm;sketch-based multidimensional IDS;traffic descriptors;traffic parameters,,1,,21,,,14-16 Oct. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Online Adaptive Anomaly Detection for Augmented Network Flows,"Ippoliti, D.; Xiaobo Zhou","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO, USA","Modelling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS), 2014 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on",20150209,2014,,,433,442,"Traditional network anomaly detection involves developing models that rely on packet inspection. Increasing network speeds and use of encrypted protocols make per-packet inspection unsuited for today's networks. One method of overcoming this obstacle is flow based analysis. Many existing approaches are special purpose, i.e., limited to detecting specific behavior. Also, the data reduction inherent in identifying anomalous flows hinders alert correlation. In this paper we propose a dynamic anomaly detection approach for augmented flows. We sketch network state during flow creation enabling general purpose threat detection. We design and develop a support vector machine based adaptive anomaly detection and correlation mechanism capable of aggregating alerts without a-priori alert classification and evolving models online. We develop a confidence forwarding mechanism identifying a small percentage predictions for additional processing. We show effectiveness of our methods on both enterprise and backbone traces. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to maintain high accuracy without the need for offline training.",1526-7539,,,10.1109/MASCOTS.2014.60,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033682,,Adaptation models;Correlation;Detectors;Inspection;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors,computer network security;support vector machines,alert aggregation;alert correlation;anomalous flow identification;augmented flows;augmented network flows;backbone traces;confidence forwarding mechanism;data reduction;dynamic anomaly detection approach;enterprise traces;flow based analysis;flow creation;general purpose threat detection;network anomaly detection;network state;online adaptive anomaly detection;packet inspection;support vector machine based adaptive anomaly detection mechanism;support vector machine based adaptive correlation mechanism,,0,,34,,,9-11 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
A TCP delay-based mechanism for detecting congestion in the Internet,"Dassouki, K.; Debar, H.; Safa, H.; Hijazi, A.","Dept. of Networks & Telecommun. Services, Telecom SudParis, Evry, France","Communications and Information Technology (ICCIT), 2013 Third International Conference on",20130815,2013,,,141,145,"Internet congestion existing solutions such as active queue management algorithms have many shortcomings, mainly related to the detection phase. These algorithms depend on routers' buffer statistics to detect congestion and their performance is highly affected by the environment and the parameters that are used. In this paper we are proposing a mechanism that is capable of detecting congestions by monitoring passively an aggregation link. The proposed mechanism does not need parameterizations since all the used parameters are deduced from public real internet traces using statistical approaches and uses TCP delays as a detection parameter. It is dynamic since the detection is proportional to the severity of the congestion. Experimental results have shown that the proposed mechanism is able to detect congestion rapidly and does not suffer from false alarms.",,978-1-4673-5306-9,,10.1109/ICCITechnology.2013.6579538,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6579538,Active Queue Management;Congestion Detection;Internet;TCP;throughput,Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Estimation;Information technology;Internet;Logic gates;Monitoring,Internet;telecommunication links;transport protocols,Internet congestion;TCP delay-based mechanism;active queue management algorithms;aggregation link;buffer statistics,,0,,19,,,19-21 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

We discuss how this approach addresses a growing trend in distributed attacks while also providing solutions to problems commonly associated with distributed detection systems. We explore the impacts to detection performance from network topology, from the defined range of distributed communication for each node, and from involving only a small percent of total nodes in the network in the distributed detection communication. We evaluate our algorithm using a software-based testing implementation, and demonstrate up to 20% improvement in detection capability over parallel, isolated anomaly detectors for both stealthy port scans and DDoS attacks.",,,,10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288396,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288396,,Accuracy;Detection algorithms;Diamonds;Network topology;Protocols;Sensitivity;Topology,computer network security;telecommunication network topology,DDoS attack;DIAMoND;distributed attacks;distributed communication;distributed intrusion-anomaly monitoring for nonparametric detection;network topology;software-based testing implementation,,,,,,,3-6 Aug. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
