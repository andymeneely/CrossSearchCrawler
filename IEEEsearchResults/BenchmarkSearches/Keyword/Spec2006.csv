A comprehensive monitoring framework for virtual computing environment,Guofu Xiang; Hai Jin; Deqing Zou,"Services Comput. Technol. & Syst. Lab., Huazhong Univ. of Sci. & Technol., Wuhan, China","Information Networking (ICOIN), 2012 International Conference on",20120309,2012,,,551,556,"Virtualization can divide or aggregate the underlying resource flexibly, and it attracts attention from both academic and industry in recent years. Guest operating systems in virtual machines can be various, and the states of virtual machines changes all the time. Due to the complexity of virtual computing environment, it brings tremendous challenges for security monitoring. Existing monitoring mechanism can not adapt to the dynamic and diversity of virtual machines. Therefore, a comprehensive monitoring framework, named ComMon, is proposed in this paper, which implements comprehensive monitoring from three aspects: network, process, and file. It has the characteristics of real-time, transparency and generality.",1976-7684,978-1-4673-0251-7,,10.1109/ICOIN.2012.6164438,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164438,comprehensive monitoring;generality;real time;transparency;virtual machine,Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Registers,operating systems (computers);security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation,ComMon framework;comprehensive monitoring framework;file monitoring aspect;generality characteristics;guest operating systems;network monitoring aspect;process monitoring aspect;realtime characteristics;security monitoring;transparency characteristics;virtual computing environment;virtual machines;virtualization,,1,,19,,,1-3 Feb. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Diversity in cloud systems through runtime and compile-time relocation,"Kanter, M.; Taylor, S.","Thayer Sch. of Eng., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","Technologies for Homeland Security (HST), 2013 IEEE International Conference on",20140102,2013,,,396,402,"Cloud computing has become popular in recent years due to the cost and resource savings associated with virtual machines using shared resources. Unfortunately, this mode of operation serves as a vulnerability amplifier because each computer executes multiple versions of the same operating code base carrying the same vulnerabilities. This paper explores techniques for the system's run-time loader to generate diversity from a single binary source. In addition, we describe compile-time techniques that can augment and enhance the diversity gained through the run-time system alone. Collectively, the techniques randomize the code and data of the binary eliminating vulnerability amplification. Entropy is used as a measure of diversity and we explore the entropy gained by the techniques under several different assumptions concerning the attackers knowledge of the system. The techniques have been implemented into Bear, a from-scratch hypervisor and microkernel designed to run military cloud applications that require resilience.",,978-1-4799-3963-3,,10.1109/THS.2013.6699037,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6699037,computer security;information security,Entropy;Geophysical measurement techniques;Ground penetrating radar;Kernel;Programming;Runtime;Virtual machine monitors,cloud computing;military computing;resource allocation,Bear hypervisor;binary source;cloud computing;cloud systems diversity;compile-time relocation;cost savings;entropy;microkernel;military cloud applications;resource savings;runtime loader;shared resources;virtual machines;vulnerability amplification;vulnerability amplifier,,0,,37,,,12-14 Nov. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
CloudMonatt: An architecture for security health monitoring and attestation of virtual machines in cloud computing,"Tianwei Zhang; Lee, R.B.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ, USA","Computer Architecture (ISCA), 2015 ACM/IEEE 42nd Annual International Symposium on",20151001,2015,,,362,374,"Cloud customers need guarantees regarding the security of their virtual machines (VMs), operating within an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud system. This is complicated by the customer not knowing where his VM is executing, and on the semantic gap between what the customer wants to know versus what can be measured in the cloud. We present an architecture for monitoring a VM's security health, with the ability to attest this to the customer in an unforgeable manner. We show a concrete implementation of property-based attestation and a full prototype based on the OpenStack open source cloud software.",,,,10.1145/2749469.2750422,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284079,,Concrete;Cryptography;Monitoring;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Servers,cloud computing;public domain software;security of data;virtual machines,CloudMonatt;OpenStack open source cloud software;VM security health;cloud computing;cloud customers;property-based attestation;security health monitoring;virtual machines,,,,,,,13-17 June 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
