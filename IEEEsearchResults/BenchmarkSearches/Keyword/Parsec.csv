Security in MPSoCs: A NoC Firewall and an Evaluation Framework,"Grammatikakis, M.D.; Papadimitriou, K.; Petrakis, P.; Papagrigoriou, A.; Kornaros, G.; Christoforakis, I.; Tomoutzoglou, O.; Tsamis, G.; Coppola, M.","Technol. Educ. Inst. of Crete, Heraklion, Greece","Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, IEEE Transactions on",20150724,2015,34,8,1344,1357,"In multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), a CPU can access physical resources, such as on-chip memory or I/O devices. Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.",0278-0070,,,10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504,Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security,Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip,firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip,AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests,,0,,28,,6/23/2015,Aug. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
