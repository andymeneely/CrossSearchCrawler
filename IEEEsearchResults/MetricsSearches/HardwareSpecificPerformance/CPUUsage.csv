Achieving Flow-Level Controllability in Network Intrusion Detection System,Bo Song; Weibing Yang; Mingyu Chen; Xiaofang Zhao; Jianping Fan,"Inst. of Comput.

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead. What's more, in the case of crash occurrence, the ATEP scheme is still able to maintain rather steady throughput without sudden decrease.",,978-1-4244-7422-6,978-1-4244-7421-9,10.1109/SNPD.2010.18,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521501,ATEP;controllability;crash detection;flow-driven;quick crash recovery,Artificial intelligence;Computer crashes;Controllability;Intrusion detection;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Throughput;Vehicle crash testing;Yarn,security of data,active two-threshold scheme;data preserving overhead;flow-level controllability;ideal exit-point;network intrusion detection system;packet loss;packet-driven NIDS;packet-driven systems;quick crash recovery mechanism;software crashes,,1,,14,,,9-11 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet.

A game theoretic approach to control IDS sensitivity,"Mozafari, N.; Khodayari, M.; Farhadi, M.-K.; Hamzeh, A.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, noncooperative game.

Identification of network intrusion with efficient Genetic Algorithm using Bayesian classifier,"Sangeetha, K.; Periasamy, P.S.; Prakash, S.","Comput. Sci. & Eng., SNS Coll. of Technol., Coimbatore, India","Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), 2015 International Conference on",20150824,2015,,,1,4,"In the field of computer security, the intrusion detection system plays a major role. Whenever the intrusion takes place, intrusion detection technology is used to ensure the data integrity and system availability. Normally the intrusion is considered as an abnormal activity performed by the intruder. The breaking of information system or occurrence of any abnormal activity if performed by the intruder is known as intrusion. Based on the nature of access the intruders can be broadly classified into two groups, as internal intruders and external intruders. One who is having the access permission but trying to perform unauthorized or illegal activities is known as internal intruders. On the other hand one who do not have the access permission, but attacks the system with variety of techniques is called identified as external intruders. The IDS is a security management system for the computers and networks. It helps in monitoring and detecting all the activity which takes place in the Network. On consideration, the firewall technology works on the predetermined rule set. In contrast to this, IDS is potential to be present throughout the network as dynamic defense system. Hence it helps to catch all types of attacks. Genetic Algorithms (GA) is a method of search through solution space towards an optimal solution that uses the mechanics of natural selection and genetics. The main motivating factor for using GA is that it makes no use of domain knowledge; it works on probabilistic techniques making use of payoff data. Another huge advantage that GA has over other learning systems is that GA is totally unsupervised, once set in motion, it presents the user with a good solution. These coupled with the versatility and robustness of GA makes the technique of choice for this work. This research work focus on applying the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on the classifiers to network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

This paper studies an attack scenario that malicious tenants use cloud resources to launch DoS attack targeting at data center subnets. Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors.

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3.

The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents.

For the ease of development, complex packet processing algorithms are often implemented at the user-space level. As a result, performance benchmarks for packet processing algorithms often show a great gap when packets are input from different sources. An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated. Experiments show that the proposed software architecture reduces 30% of CPU utilization. In addition, the overall system throughput can be improved by a factor of 1.6 when it is applied to the well-known snort-inline open source intrusion detection system.",pending,978-1-4244-6889-8,,10.1109/TENCON.2010.5686441,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5686441,Fast Queue;in-line packet processing;zero copy interface,,Linux;public domain software;security of data;software architecture,Linux operating system;UNIX-like operating systems;accelerate in-line packet processing algorithm;fast queue;network interface;raw packet trace file;snort-inline open source intrusion detection system;software architecture;user-space level,,1,,11,,,21-24 Nov. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain.

So, online measurement of these network performance metrics itself acts as an Intrusion detection system. The anomalies are the inference for network security analyst to suspect whether the network is under attack or not. Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack.

Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users.

To ensure the security and reliability of a modernized power grid, the current deployment of millions of smart meters requires the development of innovative situational awareness solutions to prevent compromised devices from impacting the stability of the grid and the reliability of the energy distribution infrastructure. To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time.

Securing wireless sensor networks from denial-of-service attacks using artificial intelligence and the CLIPS expert system tool,"Taylor, V.F.; Fokum, D.T.","Fac. of Sci. & Technol., Univ. of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica","Southeastcon, 2013 Proceedings of IEEE",20130725,2013,,,1,6,"Wireless sensor networks consist of a number of autonomous sensor nodes which are deployed in various areas of interest to collect data and cooperatively transmit that data back to a base station. Wireless sensor networks have been used in military applications, environmental monitoring applications, healthcare applications, and even home applications. An adversary may want to disrupt these sensor networks for various reasons. Adversaries range from a hacker with a laptop to corporations and governments who have a vested interest in compromising the proper operation of an unwelcome sensor network. Since sensor nodes are small and usually placed in uncontrolled environments, they are susceptible to capture and reprogramming by an adversary. The low-power nature of sensor nodes make traditional strong encryption approaches to network security infeasible as nodes have limited processing power and sometimes significant energy constraints. This paper presents work in progress on developing a system which would protect a wireless sensor network from denial-of-service attacks after one or more nodes on the network have been captured and reprogrammed by an adversary. This system removes the need to rely on tamper proof packaging to protect the cryptographic keys and other sensitive data which is stored on nodes. With the proposed system, even if cryptographic keys are obtained by an attacker and are used to send false routing information or other spurious control information, the network will be able to identify such malicious nodes by using artificial intelligence and an expert system developed using the C Language Integrated Production System tool.",1091-0050,978-1-4799-0052-7,,10.1109/SECON.2013.6567421,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567421,,Computer crime;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks,C language;artificial intelligence;cryptography;expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks,C language integrated production system tool;CLIPS expert system tool;artificial intelligence;autonomous sensor nodes;base station;cryptographic key protection;data collection;denial-of-service attacks;energy constraints;environmental monitoring applications;false routing information;healthcare applications;home applications;limited processing power;malicious nodes;military applications;sensitive data protection;spurious control information;strong encryption approaches;tamper proof packaging;unwelcome sensor network;wireless sensor network security,,1,,20,,,4-7 April 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time.

However, clear design guidelines and techniques for the support of scalable IMS-based deployment, especially for data-intensive services such as mobility management, presence, and instant messaging, are still missing. That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates.

The success of forming ad-hoc computer clusters greatly depends on the usage characteristic of an organization. An organization with hundreds of workstations does not necessarily imply that it has the opportunity to form an ad-hoc computer cluster because different workstations may have different turned-on durations and these workstations may not be available at the same time depending on their users' usage. The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis. Some workstations have more consistent repetitive turned-on patterns while some do not, and this work created a framework to distinguish these workstations. The contribution of this work is the creation of a framework that allows administrators to identify potential workstations for forming ad-hoc computer clusters of their environment.",,978-1-4799-4556-6,,10.1109/I4CT.2014.6914181,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914181,Distributed Systems;Resource Management;Resource Monitoring;Resource Prediction,Clouds;Distributed computing;Monitoring;Organizations;Prediction methods;Workstations,workstation clusters,ad-hoc computer clusters;time 42 day;turned-on patterns;workstations uptime analysis framework,,0,,27,,,2-4 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection. In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA process. We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and naïve Bayes classification scheme.

Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters.

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall.

While originally designed for optimising traffic handling and accounting in the network, flow data appeared to be powerful for intrusion detection.

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection.

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries.

VMDriver: A Driver-Based Monitoring Mechanism for Virtualization,Guofu Xiang; Hai Jin; Deqing Zou; Xinwen Zhang; Sha Wen; Feng Zhao,"Cluster & Grid Comput.

Existing solutions are either coarse-grained - monitoring in granularity of VM level, or not general - only support specific monitoring functions for particular guest operating system (OS). Thus they do not satisfy the monitoring requirement in large-scale server cluster such as data center and public cloud platform, where each physical platform runs hundreds of VMs with different guest OSes. In this paper, we propose VMDriver, a general and fine-grained approach for virtualization monitoring. The novel design of VMDriver is the separation of event interception point in VMM level and rich guest OS semantic reconstructions in management domain. With this design, variant monitoring drivers in management domain can mask the differences of guest OSes. We implement VMDriver on Xen and our experimental study shows that it introduces very small performance overhead. We demonstrate its generality by inspecting four aspects information about the target virtual machines with different guest OSes.

In recent years, the availability of these ubiquitous and mobile services has significantly increased due to the different form of connectivity provided by mobile devices, such as GSM, GPRS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools.

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.).

To enhance security in <i>ad hoc</i> networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of other nodes without central authorities. An information-theoretic framework is presented, to quantitatively measure trust and build a novel trust model (FAPtrust) with multiple trust decision factors. These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

Therefore, we focused an anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector for detecting faults in IP networks and evaluated whether this method can be applied to IP networks by using network fault simulations.
