As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods.

Improving Effectiveness of Intrusion Detection by Correlation Feature Selection,"Hai Nguyen; Franke, K.; Petrovic, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Media Technol., Gjovik Univ. Coll., Gjovik, Norway","Availability, Reliability, and Security, 2010. ARES '10 International Conference on",20100325,2010,,,17,24,"The quality of the feature selection algorithm is one of the most important factors that affects the effectiveness of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm.

Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The human labeling of the available network audit data instances is usually tedious, time consuming and expensive.

Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier.

Res., Pretoria, South Africa","Information Security for South Africa, 2013",20131021,2013,,,1,5,"Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm which presents challenges for digital forensic investigators. Digital forensics is a branch of computer security that makes use of electronic evidence to build up a criminal case or for troubleshooting purposes. Advances have been made since the advent of Cloud computing in addressing issues that came with the Cloud including that of security. However, not all aspects of security are advancing. Developments in digital forensics still leave a lot to be desired in terms of standards and appropriate digital forensic tools that are applicable in the Cloud. To achieve that, standards as well as standard tools are required for successful evidence collection, preservation, analysis and conviction in case of a criminal case. This paper contributes towards addressing issues in digital forensics by presenting an algorithm that can be used in the evidence identification phase of a digital forensic process. Data in Cloud environments exist in the Internet or in networked environments and data is always accessed remotely. There is therefore at least one connection to a host that exists in a Cloud environment. In a case of a computer system that hosts a Cloud service, the number of connections from clients can be very large. In such a scenario it is very hard to identify an attacker from both active and recently disconnected connections to a host. This may require an investigator to probe all individual IP addresses connected to the host which can be time consuming and costly. There is therefore a need for a mechanism that can identify and rank remote hosts that are connected to a victim host and that may be associated with a malicious activity. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses probabilities to identify and rank suspicious remote hosts connected to a victim host. This algorithm helps minimize the effort required of investigators to probe each IP address that is connected to a victim as connected IP addresses will be prio- itized according to their rank.",,,,10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641044,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641044,Cloud Computing;Digital Forensic Processes;Digital Forensics;Intrusion Detection,Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Digital forensics;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model,cloud computing;digital forensics;probability,Internet;cloud computing;cloud environment;computer security;digital forensic investigation;digital forensic tools;electronic evidence;evidence identification phase;individual IP addresses;malicious activity;probability;remote host ranking;remote host selection;victim host,,0,,16,,,14-16 Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Based on the accurate binary classifiers, our model applies a new ensemble approach which aggregates each binary classifierpsilas decisions for the same input and decides which class is most suitable for a given input. During this process, the potential bias of certain binary classifier could be alleviated by other binary classifierspsila decision.

The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset.

Presently there are a lot of algorithms applied in intrusion detection systems. The SVM is one of the most successful ones in the data mining area, but its biasing behavior with uneven datasets limits its use. Shu-Xin Du proposed an improved approach named weighted SVM to solve this problem. However, Weighted SVM considers different penalty parameters about class only and ignores importance among different samples. In this paper, we introduced class and sample weighted factors respectively and propose a new method, namely, Class and Sample Weighted C-Support Vector Machine (CSWC-SVM) to solve the problem.

To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents.

On the other hand, anticipatory reasoning-reacting systems (ARRS) were proposed as a high secure system with the ability to defend against malice anticipatorily, however, until now, there is no concrete implementation of ARRS for security, as well as no evidence showing the practical usefulness of anticipatory computing for security.

Efficient NIDS can be developed by defining a proper rule set for classifying network audit data into normal or attack patterns. Generally, each dataset is characterized by a large set of features, but not all features will be relevant or fully contribute identifying an attack. Since different attacks need different subsets to have better detection accuracy, this paper describes an improved feature selection algorithm to identify most appropriate subset of features for a certain attack.

In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account.

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system.

It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data.

To protect these networks, intrusion detection systems are used. Signature-based intrusion detection cannot find previously unknown attacks, which is why anomaly detection is needed. However, many new systems are slow and complicated. We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible.

This KDD CUP 1999 data set was generated by domain expert at MIT Lincon lab. To reduced number of features of this KDD CUP data set, various feature reduction techniques has been already used. These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al. Tesfahun's approach reduces time and complexity of model and improves the detection rate for the minority classes in a considerable amount. This work investigates the effectiveness and the feasibility of Tesfahun et al.'s feature reduction technique on Back Propagation Neural Network classifier. We had performed various experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset and recorded Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Fscore values. In this work, we had done Basic, N-Fold Validation and Testing comparisons on reduced dataset with full feature dataset. Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters.

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset. From the experiments it is evident that a closed and secluded network such as SSENet and Tstat tool help researchers in developing and analyzing a new dataset which reflects the changing scenario of network activities.",2157-0647,978-1-4577-1087-2,,10.1109/AHICI.2011.6113948,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113948,Feature Construction;NIDS;SSENet-2011;Tstat,Business;Complexity theory;Fires;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Silicon;Vectors,Internet;security of data,Internet;KDD CUP 99 dataset;NIDS;SSENet-2011;data mining;evolutionary algorithms;machine learning;network intrusion detection system;security experts,,2,,7,,,4-6 Nov. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: ""Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise"".

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

Organizations are devising and deploying new solutions for analyzing, monitoring and predicting these insider threats. However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem.

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset.

High-Performance Intrusion Detection Using OptiGrid Clustering and Grid-Based Labelling,"Ishida, M.; Takakura, H.; Okabe, Y.","Grad.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.",,978-1-4577-0531-1,978-0-7695-4423-6,10.1109/SAINT.2011.12,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129,OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system,Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data,feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data,KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data,,3,,16,,,18-21 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

A feature selection method is required to be general enough to find representative features from training data, which are then used for classifying test patterns. The situation where the features selected from the training data are quite different from the representative features of the testing data is called over-selecting. The main causes of the over-selecting phenomenon are: non-comprehensive consideration of statistical properties of the training data, heuristic search strategies for feature selection and small sample size of the data set for training. In this paper, we show the influence of the over-selecting phenomenon on the over-fitting phenomenon of machine learning algorithms. We propose a new framework to address principal causes of over-selecting and thus reduce the chance of over-fitting. Our new framework that we call Ensemble Feature Selection measure (EnFS), allows to consider many statistical properties of a given data set at the same time by combining many feature selection methods used in the filter model. From the chosen feature selection measures, a new combined measure is constructed. We also propose a new search algorithm that ensures the globally optimal feature subsets by means of the constructed measure. The new search approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming (M01LP) problem by means of the branch-and-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear in the number of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our EnFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application. Experimental results obtained over the KDD CUP'99 benchmarking data set for IDS show that our EnFS measure is capable of reducing over-fitting by addressing over-selecting.",2164-7143,978-1-4577-1676-8,,10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121657,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121657,correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0–1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0–1 fractional programming,Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Polynomials;Programming;Testing;Training;Training data,feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;pattern recognition;security of data;set theory;tree searching,EnFS measure;branch-and- bound algorithm;ensemble feature selection measures;globally optimal feature subsets;heuristic search strategy;intrusion detection system;linear programming problem;machine learning algorithm;noncomprehensive consideration;over fitting phenomenon;pattern recognition system;representative feature;statistical property;test pattern classification,,0,,15,,,22-24 Nov. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Centroid-Based Nearest Neighbor Feature Representation for E-Government Intrusion Detection,Chih-Fong Tsai; Jung-Hsiang Tsai; Jui-Sheng Chou,"Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat. Central Univ., Jungli, Taiwan","World Telecommunications Congress (WTC), 2012",20120315,2012,,,1,6,"Accompanied by the invention of information and communication of technologies, e-government has become a prominent feature of modern governance in every country. The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.",,978-1-4577-1459-7,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432,,Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training,Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing,CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs,,1,,18,,,5-6 March 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine.

This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved.

The amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Prior studies developed feature selection and feature extraction techniques to reduce the size of data. None has focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. Dimensionality reduction is a field in machine learning that consists on mapping high dimensional data into lower dimension while preserving important features of the original dataset. Dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to reduce the amount of data in applications such as speech signals, digital photographs, fMRI scans, DNA microarrays, Hyper spectral data. The purpose of this paper is to find the finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. This evaluation is necessary to improve the efficiency of NIDS in identifying existing attack patterns and recognizing new intrusion in real-time.

In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers.

However, under-sampled classes or rare but certain relations are overlooked by this measure, which can result in missing relevant features that could be very predictive of variables of interest, such as certain phenotypes or disorders in biomedical research, rare but dangerous factors in ecology, intrusions in network systems, etc. On the other hand, Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) is a nonlinear correlation measure effectively used to detect independence but its use for feature selection or ranking is limited due to the fact that its formulation is not intended to measure the amount of information (entropy) of the dependence. In this paper, we propose Predictive Mutual Information (PMI), a hybrid measure of relevance not only is based on MI but also accounts for predictability of signals from one another as in KCCA.

In order to detect unknown attacks, anomaly detection technique is a commonly used method. Meanwhile, many scholars are studying more effective and easy-to-use anomaly detection methods. In this paper, a new intrusion detection approach inspired by the function of biological memory cell is proposed. The detectors in this approach (which called memory detector) are more effective than common detectors. The generation method of memory detector is detailed.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine.

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection.

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset.

Data inconsistency is firstly employed to find the optimal features, and the sequential forward search is then utilized to facilitate the selection of subset features.

In this approach we train two classifiers with two different training sets. The KDD Cup99 dataset was splitted into two training sets where one contains full of non rare attacks datasets and other contains datasets of rare attack categories.

A Framework for Clustering Categorical Time-Evolving Data,Fuyuan Cao; Jiye Liang; Liang Bai; Xingwang Zhao; Chuangyin Dang,"Sch. of Comput. & Inf. Technol., Shanxi Univ., Taiyuan, China","Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on",20101004,2010,18,5,872,882,"A fundamental assumption often made in unsupervised learning is that the problem is static, i.e., the description of the classes does not change with time. However, many practical clustering tasks involve changing environments. It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality. Furthermore, compared with the other framework, the proposed one needs fewer parameters, which is favorable for specific applications.",1063-6706,,,10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050891,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467229,Categorical time-evolving data;clusters relationship analysis;data labeling;drifting-concept detecting,Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Communication system traffic control;Credit cards;Information technology;Labeling;Object detection;Stock markets;Unsupervised learning,computational complexity;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning,categorical time-evolving data;changing environments;cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm;clustering tasks;data-labeling algorithm;drifting-concept detecting algorithm;generalized clustering framework;numerical time-evolving data;sliding window;time complexity analysis;unsupervised learning,,5,,34,,5/20/2010,Oct. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Features Selection for Intrusion Detection Systems Based on Support Vector Machines,"Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON","Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, 2009.

These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset.

An effective network-based Intrusion Detection using Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm augmented with near-deterministic detector generation,"Senhua Yu; Dasgupta, D.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA","Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security (CICS), 2011 IEEE Symposium on",20110711,2011,,,17,24,"The Human Immune System (HIS) employs multilevel defense against harmful and unseen pathogens through innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.",,978-1-4244-9905-2,,10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393,CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic,Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing,Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines,CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation,,1,,18,,,11-15 April 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a Â¿gray boxÂ¿ since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned.

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy.

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm.

Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model.

For the experimental work we use a well-known dataset (i.e. KDD-99) that has become a standard to compare research although its drawbacks.

In order to model normal behaviors accurately and improve the performance of intrusion detection, a joint evolutionary neural network (JENN) is presented in this paper. Input features, network structure and connection weights are evolved jointly using genetic algorithm. To evolve all three tasks jointly, a hybrid representation scheme is employed, and penalty factors for the number of input nodes and hidden nodes are introduced into fitness function. The generated-subnet based crossover operator is adopted in consideration of the relationship between genotype and phenotype.

Multiple learning based classifiers using layered approach and Feature Selection for attack detection,"Subbulakshmi, T.; Afroze, A.F.","Sethu Inst. of Technol., Virudhunagar, India","Emerging Trends in Computing, Communication and Nanotechnology (ICE-CCN), 2013 International Conference on",20130613,2013,,,308,314,"One of the major shares of the current security infrastructure is formed by the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes.

In botnets detection, in particularly, behavioural-based approaches suffer from the unavailability of the benchmark datasets and this lead to lack of precise results evaluation of botnet detection systems, comparison, and deployment which originates from the deficiency of adequate datasets.

Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs.

However, limited research studies have concentrated on investigation the correlation between features together and its impact on DoS attack classification accuracy. Therefore and in this paper, remove correlated attributes algorithm has been proposed to select the most effective features on used in network traffic classification. Since that removing related features in a classification model minimizes the detection model error rate, It is a high likelihood that proposed model implementation increase flooding attack classification accuracy rate. In this research study, the proposed model experimental methodology and validation method has been highlighted.",,,,10.1109/ACSAT.2013.26,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836555,Flooding based DoS Attack;classification accuracy;feature selection,Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Correlation;Feature extraction;Floods;Intrusion detection,computer network security,DoS attack classification;computer networks;flooding based DoS attack;remove correlated attributes algorithm,,0,,25,,,23-24 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Applying data mining and machine learning techniques to network intrusion detection often faces the problem of very large training dataset size. For example, the training dataset commonly used for the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project contained approximately five hundred thousand (10% sample of the original five million) observations, which were used to build intrusion detection classification models. The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack. A comparison of the actively trained neural network model with a C4.5 decision tree indicated that the actively learned model had better generalization accuracy.

One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests.

There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime.

Furthermore, due to their popularity and users ability to create content, Web 2.0 applications have become particularly attractive targets. These trends clearly illustrate the need for better understanding of malicious cyber activities based on both qualitative and quantitative analysis. This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes.

"Intrusion detection technique by using k-means, fuzzy neural network and SVM classifiers","Chandrasekhar, A.M.; Raghuveer, K.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Sri Jayachamarajendra Coll. of Eng. (SJCE), Mysore, India","Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), 2013 International Conference on",20130221,2013,,,1,7,"With the impending era of internet, the network security has become the key foundation for lot of financial and business web applications. Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy.",,978-1-4673-2906-4,,10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466310,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466310,Intrusion Detection System;K-means Clustering;Neuro-fuzzy;Radial Support Vector Machine,,Internet;data mining;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines,BPNN;Columbia model;IDS building;Internet;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;SVM classifier;business Web application;data mining technique;decision tree;detection accuracy;financial Web application;fuzzy neural network;intrusion detection system;intrusion detection technique;k-means clustering;network security;neuro-fuzzy model;radial SVM classification;radial basis support vector machine;sensitivity;specificity,,5,,23,,,4-6 Jan. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Learning Anomalies in IDSs by Means of Multivariate Finite Mixture Models,"Greggio, N.","ARTS Lab., Pontedera, Italy","Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA), 2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on",20130617,2013,,,251,258,"In this work a fast method for the unsupervised fitting of a set of data by means of Gaussian mixtures has been studied and developed. It allows to implement applications to Information Security, with major on anomaly detection Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Its key feature is the online selection of the number of mixture components together with the fitting parameter of each component. With many components the description is accurate. However, the computational burden increases as well. The best compromise between the description accuracy and the computational complexity is given by a derivation of the Minimum Message Length (MML) information criterion. The normal network behavior is assumed to be interpreted by the cluster with the highest covariance matrix, while the other smaller components are considered representing anomalies. We tested our technique with the well known KDD99 Cup data set, in order to clearly compare our findings with the other state of the art methods.

Signature-based IDS using Boolean Weighted Score multiple classifiers,"Saelee, P.; Viriyaphol, P.","Dept. of Telecommun.

In the proposed framework, there are two modules, the data preprocessing module and the classifier module. Data preprocessing module is the process of preparing and adjusting the raw data in order to feed into the classification algorithms. Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not. The study was based on available network traffic datasets (KDD'99 dataset and WiSNet dataset). According to the experimental results, using the multi-classifiers and the Boolean weighted scoring can better detect the attack instances than the single classifier does.",,978-1-4673-1937-9,,10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297119,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297119,Classification algorithm;Intrusion Detection;Scoring and Weighting,Computational modeling;Computers;Data preprocessing;Intrusion detection;Probes;Telecommunication traffic;Training,Boolean algebra;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability,Boolean value;Boolean weighted score method;KDD99 dataset;WiSNet dataset;attack detection;attack type;attribute learning;attribute scores;classification algorithm;classifier module;data preprocessing module;multiple classifiers;network traffic dataset;probability;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection system;training model,,0,,32,,,12-14 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Minimal dataset for Network Intrusion Detection Systems via MID-PCA: A hybrid approach,"Nziga, J.-P.; Cannady, J.","Grad. Sch. of Comput. & Inf. Sci., Nova Southeastern Univ., Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA","Intelligent Systems (IS), 2012 6th IEEE International Conference",20121022,2012,,,453,460,"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) monitor internet traffic to detect malicious activities. Unfortunately, the amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Several feature selection and feature extraction techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of data. Few are focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the finding of that finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. A new hybrid algorithm MID-PCA combining PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance - MID evaluation criteria) is proposed. PCA is first applied to the original dataset. Then, mRMR-MID is applied to the intermediary output to further reduce redundancy and maximize relevancy. An exhaustive evaluation of the MID-PCA algorithm is conducted with the KDD Cup'99, a used widely dataset in the network security community. MID-PCA performance was compared to that of PCA and mRMR using two classifiers namely J48 (C4.5) and BayesNet. Experimental results assert the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm MID-PCA for NIDS feature extraction compared with PCA and Mutual Information. The newly proposed MID-PCA shows better performance and classification accuracies with reduced datasets of only 4 dimensions for BayesNet (99.77%) and 6 dimensions for J48 (99.94%). This is an improvement over PCA which achieves similar classification accuracy with 12 principal components (twelve dimensions). An extension of this paper will conduct broader experiments using other datasets, then compare results to that of several well known feature reduction algorithms to confirm the superiority of MID-PCA.",,978-1-4673-2276-8,,10.1109/IS.2012.6335176,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335176,Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Mutual Information;Principal Component Analysis,Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Principal component analysis,Internet;computer network security;data analysis;feature extraction;pattern classification;principal component analysis;redundancy;telecommunication traffic,BayesNet classifier comparison;Internet traffic monitoring;J48 classifier comparison;KDD Cup'99;MID evaluation criteria;MID-PCA hybrid algorithm;NIDS;classification accuracy;data size reduction;feature extraction technique;feature selection technique;mRMR;malicious activity detection;minimum redundancy maximum relevance;mutual information;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;redundancy reduction;relevancy maximization,,0,,31,,,6-8 Sept. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
An on-line wireless attack detection system using multi-layer data fusion,"Aparicio-Navarro, F.J.; Kyriakopoulos, K.G.; Parish, D.J.","Dept. of Electron. & Electr. Eng., Loughborough Univ., Loughborough, UK","Measurements and Networking Proceedings (M&N), 2011 IEEE International Workshop on",20111201,2011,,,1,5,"Computer networks and more specifically wireless communication networks are increasingly becoming susceptible to more sophisticated and untraceable attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems either focus on just one layer of observation or use a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. This paper describes a synergistic approach of fusing decisions of whether an attack takes place by using multiple measurements from different layers of wireless communication networks. The described method is implemented on a live system that monitors a wireless network in real time and gives an indication of whether a malicious frame exists or not. This is achieved by analysing specific metrics and comparing them against historical data. The proposed system assigns for each metric a belief of whether an attack takes place or not. The beliefs from different metrics are fused with the Dempster-Shafer technique with the ultimate goal of limiting false alarms by combining beliefs from various network layers. The on-line experimental results show that cross-layer techniques and data fusion perform more efficiently compared to conventional methods.",,978-1-4577-0455-0,,10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088478,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088478,Cross-layer measurements;Data fusion;Dempster-Shafer;Wi-Fi;Wireless attacks,Intrusion detection;Measurement;Monitoring;Real time systems;Web sites;Wireless networks,inference mechanisms;radiocommunication;sensor fusion;telecommunication security,Dempster-Shafer technique;computer network;cross-layer technique;intrusion detection system;malicious frame;multilayer data fusion;online wireless attack detection system;synergistic approach;wireless communication network,,0,,11,,,10-11 Oct. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
