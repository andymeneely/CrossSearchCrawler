Network intrusion detection system using J48 Decision Tree,"Sahu, S.; Mehtre, B.M.","Sch. of Comput. & Inf.

For network intrusion detection system (NIDS), many data mining and machine learning techniques are used. However, for evaluation, most of the researchers used KDD Cup 99 data set, which has widely criticized for not showing current network situation. In this paper we used a new labelled network dataset, called Kyoto 2006+ dataset. In Kyoto 2006+ data set, every instant is labelled as normal (no attack), attack (known attack) and unknown attack. We use Decision Tree (J48) algorithm to classify the network packet that can be used for NIDS. For training and testing we used 134665 network instances. The generated rules works with 97.2% correctness for detecting the connection i.e., no attack, known attack or unknown attack.",,978-1-4799-8790-0,,10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275914,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275914,Data Mining;Decision tree;Intrusion Detection System;J48 algorithm;Kyoto data set,Accuracy;Data mining;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines,decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data,J48 decision tree algorithm;KDD Cup 99 dataset;Kyoto 2006+ dataset;cyber attacks;data mining technique;machine learning technique;network intrusion detection system;network packet classification,,,,,,,10-13 Aug. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Learning a new distance metric to improve an SVM-clustering based intrusion detection system,"Sani, R.A.; Ghasemi, A.","Fac. of Comput. Eng., K.N. Toosi Univ. of Technol., Tehran, Iran","Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP), 2015 International Symposium on",20150615,2015,,,284,289,"In the recent decades, many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed to enhance the security of networks. A class of IDSs is based on clustering of network traffic into normal and abnormal according to some features of the connections. The selected distance function to measure the similarity and dissimilarity of sessions' features affect the performance of clustering based IDSs. The most popular distance metric, which is used in designing these IDSs is the Euclidean distance function. In this paper, we argue that more appropriate distance functions can be deployed for IDSs. We propose a method of learning an appropriate distance function according to a set of supervision information. This metric is derived by solving a semi-definite optimization problem, which attempts to decrease the distance between the similar, and increases the distances between the dissimilar feature vectors. The evaluation of this scheme over Kyoto2006+ dataset shows that the new distance metric, can improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) clustering based IDS in terms of normal detection and false positive rates.",,978-1-4799-8817-4,,10.1109/AISP.2015.7123497,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7123497,Anomaly detection;Clustering Algorithms;Intrusion detection system;Metric learning,Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Feature extraction;Measurement;Support vector machines;Training data,mathematical programming;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic,Euclidean distance function;Kyoto2006+ dataset;SVM clustering;SVM-clustering based intrusion detection system;clustering based IDS;dissimilar feature vector;distance metric;false positive rate;network security;network traffic;normal detection;semidefinite optimization problem;support vector machine clustering,,0,,14,,,3-5 March 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
High-Performance Intrusion Detection Using OptiGrid Clustering and Grid-Based Labelling,"Ishida, M.; Takakura, H.; Okabe, Y.","Grad. Sch. of Inf., Kyoto Univ., Kyoto, Japan","Applications and the Internet (SAINT), 2011 IEEE/IPSJ 11th International Symposium on",20110825,2011,,,11,19,"This research aims to construct a high-performance anomaly based intrusion detection system. Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.",,978-1-4577-0531-1,978-0-7695-4423-6,10.1109/SAINT.2011.12,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129,OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system,Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data,feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data,KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data,,3,,16,,,18-21 July 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this paper, a better combination is proposed to address problems of the previously proposed hybrid approach of combining k-Means/k-Medoids clustering technique with Naïve Bayes classification. In this new approach, the need of large samples by the previous approach is reduced by using Support Vector Machine while maintaining the high quality clustering of k-Medoids.

In addition, the batch model of alert management is no longer adequate given that labeling is a continuous time process since incoming intrusion alerts are often collected continuously in time. Furthermore, the static model is no longer appropriate due to the fluctuation nature of the number of alerts incurred by Internet traffic fluctuation nature.

Reinforcing network security by converting massive data flow to continuous connections for IDS,"Salem, M.; Buehler, U.","Group of Network & Data Security, Univ. of Appl.

It is considered as a major deficiency while handling heterogeneous and nonstationary data stream to uncover anomaly in the online operational mode. This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area.

Live network traffic is collected that consists of real normal traffic and both real and penetration testing attack data. Attack data is then inspected and labeled by means of manual analysis. While network attacks and anomaly features vary widely, they share some commonalities that are examined here. Among these are: self-similarity convergence, periodicity, and repetition. Further, the knowledge inherent in the definition of network boundaries and advertised services can provide crucial context that allows the network analyst to consider self-aware attributes when examining network traffic sessions.
