The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category.

They perform a wide range of important network functions, including WAN optimizations, intrusion detection systems, network and application level firewalls, etc. Depending on the processing requirement of traffic, packet processing for different traffic flows may consume vastly different amounts of hardware resources (e.g., CPU and link bandwidth). Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice.

An Efficient Task Allocation Protocol for P2P Multi-agent Systems,Dayong Ye; Quan Bai; Minjie Zhang; Khin Than Win; Zhiqi Shen,"Sch. of Comput. Sci. & Software Eng., Univ. of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia","Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications, 2009 IEEE International Symposium on",20090818,2009,,,11,18,"Recently, task allocation in multi-agent systems has been investigated by many researchers. Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.",,978-0-7695-3747-4,,10.1109/ISPA.2009.14,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966,,Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness,multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation,P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment,,2,,16,,,10-12 Aug. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Several localization approaches have been proposed but most of them omit to consider that WSNs could be deployed in adversarial settings, where hostile nodes under the control of an attacker coexist with faithful ones. Verifiable multilateration (VM) was proposed to cope with this problem by leveraging on a set of trusted landmark nodes that act as verifiers. Although VM is able to recognize reliable localization measures, it allows for regions of undecided positions that can amount to the 40 percent of the monitored area. We studied the properties of VM as a noncooperative two-player game where the first player employs a number of verifiers to do VM computations and the second player controls a malicious node. The verifiers aim at securely localizing malicious nodes, while malicious nodes strive to masquerade as unknown and to pretend false positions. Thanks to game theory, the potentialities of VM are analyzed with the aim of improving the defender's strategy. We found that the best placement for verifiers is an equilateral triangle with edge equal to the power range R, and maximum deception in the undecided region is approximately 0.27R.

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are networks constructed to operate not only in stable environments. Nodes within these networks are intended to move freely, self-organizing, self-discovering and operate where the infrastructure is not present or if it is present but transitorily not available. In the current paper we are discussing about the IDS nodes, its role and the role of crucial nodes in MANET.",,978-1-4244-5965-0,978-1-4244-5967-4,10.1109/ICCIC.2010.5705765,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705765,Internet protocol(IP);Intrusion Detection Sys-tem (IDS);Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET),,mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic,IDS;MANET;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;node interaction;protocol;telecommunication traffic;wireless communication,,0,,14,,,28-29 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
Intention awareness in cyber security,"Howard, N.; Kanareykin, S.","Massachusetts Inst. of Technol., Cambridge, MA, USA","Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare and Digital Forensic (CyberSec), 2012 International Conference on",20120723,2012,,,6,11,"The problem of designing cyber-security systems and policies that adapt as quickly as their attackers do is becoming increasingly important as the world becomes more network-centric and dependent on technology. This paper proposes a new approach to this problem. Namely, it argues that there exists a significant conceptual overlap between theories of military command and control and those of information security. Specifically, the latter lends itself to the study of intentions as the basis for a proactive analytical approach that will provide a more intuitive interface between automated activity and human oversight as well as superior predictive analysis.",,978-1-4673-1425-1,,10.1109/CyberSec.2012.6246079,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246079,command and control;intention awareness;security systems,Cognition;Command and control systems;Complexity theory;Computer security;Humans;Information security,command and control systems;security of data,automated activity;cyber security system;human oversight;information security;intention awareness;intuitive interface;military command and control;network-centric;proactive analytical approach;superior predictive analysis,,0,,10,,,26-28 June 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
EGSI: TGKA Based Security Architecture for Group Communication in Grid,"Ingle, R.; Sivakumar, G.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Indian Inst. of Technol. Bombay, Mumbai, India","Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid), 2010 10th IEEE/ACM International Conference on",20100624,2010,,,34,42,"Security is one of the most important issues in the grid. Several processes generated by a user need to communicate securely. The existing architectures do not provide support for secure group communication in grid. Grid applications differ in various parameters such as life time, arrival rate, departure rate, staying period, and tolerance times for join and leave. These parameters are critical for optimizing performance and meeting the security requirements of the application. Existing grid security architectures do not harness knowledge of these parameters. In this paper, we propose an extended grid security infrastructure (EGSI) to support secure group communication in grid.

Adaptable Intrusion Detection Systems Dedicated to Concurrent Programs: A Petri Net-Based Approach,"Voron, J.-B.; De&#x0301;moulins, C.; Kordon, F.","LIP6, Univ. Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France","Application of Concurrency to System Design (ACSD), 2010 10th International Conference on",20100823,2010,,,57,66,"Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are one way to tackle the increasing number of attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities. However, the construction of such a security system is a delicate process involving: (i) the acquisition of the monitored program behavior and its storage in a compact way, (ii) the generation of a monitor detecting deviances in the program behavior. These problems are emphasized when dealing with complex or parallel programs. This paper presents a new approach to automatically generate a dedicated and customized IDS from C sources targeting multi-threaded programs. We use Petri Nets to benefit from a formal description able to compactly describe parallel behaviors. Obtained models can then be enhanced with extra requirements such as resources usage limits or temporal execution bounds by means of observers. We illustrate the benefits of our approach on a recent class of attacks targeting web servers.",1550-4808,978-1-4244-7266-6,978-1-4244-7267-3,10.1109/ACSD.2010.32,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5552689,IDS;Petri nets;automatic code generation;behavior modeling;observers;security;static analysis,Analytical models;Law;Monitoring;Observers;Petri nets;Runtime,Internet;Petri nets;concurrency control;file servers;multi-threading;security of data,Petri net-based approach;Web servers;adaptable intrusion detection systems;concurrent programs;monitored program behavior acquisition;multithreaded programs;parallel programs;security system;software vulnerability;temporal execution bounds,,0,,21,,,21-25 June 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

The complexity is of two types: One is the inherent complexity involved in the task, which is essentially the information need of the user, and the other is the perceived complexity by the user - that varies according to the proficiency of the user, in the particular subject matter of the task. We present an agent-based cognitive model for understanding both the inherent and perceived complexities. We conducted simulation of our model using logs of user sessions to arrive at the typical complexity values and to qualitatively represent them. We also carried out live experimentation through a prototype system that made estimates of the complexities as users were involved in knowledge gathering tasks, and the results vindicated our estimations.",1062-922X,978-1-4244-2793-2,978-1-4244-2794-9,10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346237,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346237,Agent-Based Cognitive Model;BDI Agents;Cognitive Agents;Cognitive Model;Inherent Complexity;Perceived Complexity;User Proficiency Estimation;Web-based Knowledge gathering Task,Computer architecture;Cybernetics;Discussion forums;Humans;Information systems;Intelligent agent;Learning systems;Prototypes;Search engines;USA Councils,Internet;cognitive systems;knowledge engineering;software agents;task analysis,Web-based knowledge-gathering tasks;agent-based cognitive model;cognitive agents;inherent complexity;user proficiency estimation,,0,,21,,,11-14 Oct. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
