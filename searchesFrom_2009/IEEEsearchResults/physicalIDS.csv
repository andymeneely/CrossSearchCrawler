While most fences meet these requirements by building a physical and psychological barrier against intruders, this is not sufficient for areas of particular interest like restricted areas of an airport or construction sites with expensive goods. To detect intruders we integrate wireless sensor nodes into a fence. We fulfill the requirements for real-world energy-awareness by using active sensors with configurable logic, power saving modes like WOR and power down modes. The sensor nodes are capable of differentiating between several events, with the appliance of a distributed classification algorithm. We present an energy-aware platform for a distributed fence surveillance system in a wireless sensor network.

In particular, the analysis is focusing on the maximum sensing range in terms of azimuth angle, height, sensitivity level for indoor and outdoor implementation. With the help of IoT, sensor which detected motion on weak detection angle or signal could communicate through internet and get signal from nearby sensor for better detection signal. The WSN platform is developed using Octopus II sensor nodes while the microwave motion detector is HB100 which detect movement using Doppler effects. Octopus II will uplink all signal through internet and provide corresponding action of virtual fencing when intrusion detected. Results show maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit is decreasing as azimuth angle increasing.

Coll., Kolkata, India","Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), 2014 International Conference on",20141016,2014,,,1,5,"This paper presents the relative merits of IR and microwave sensor technology and their combination with wireless camera for the development of a wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system and explain the phases by which the intrusion information are collected and sent to the central control station using wireless mesh network for analysis and processing the collected data. These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.",,978-1-4799-2353-3,,10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795,IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network,Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks,Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks,GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network,,0,,14,,,3-5 Jan. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

The gait characteristic of a normal walker in the nature state is an average gait period of 1.2s, in which a step period is about 0.6s and a foot touchdown time is about 0.2s. When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s. It is included in the vibration signal caused by a walking intruder inevitably. So the detection system output signal caused by a human intrusion is intermittent and periodical. If a sensing system output waveform has a period of 0.3–0.75s and a duration time of 0.15–0.25s, the disturbance source can be adjudged as a human intrusion, not as an animal or other random one.

BriGuard: a lightweight indoor intrusion detection system based on infrared light spot displacement,Leibo Liu; Weilong Zhang; Chenchen Deng; Shouyi Yin; Shaojun Wei,"Nat. Lab. for Inf. Sci. & Technol., Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Science, Measurement & Technology, IET",20150423,2015,9,3,306,314,"Indoor intrusion detection systems are widely implemented in many special departments and environments. Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second.

Outdoor perimeter security sensors a forty year perspective,"Harman, K.; Messner, W.K.","Harman Analytics, Almonte, ON, Canada","Security Technology (ICCST), 2012 IEEE International Carnahan Conference on",20121231,2012,,,1,9,"Outdoor perimeter security sensors have played, and continue to play, an important role in the security of critical assets and VIP residents over the past 40 years. In many ways outdoor security sensor technology can be described as “Slow-Tech” in a “High-Tech” world. In “High-Tech” we can expect a new product every few months with product lifetimes of one to two years. In the “Slow-Tech” world of outdoor security it typically takes two to three years to develop a new product and another two to three years to get the product approved by the user community. Fortunately once approved these products have a lifetime of ten to twenty years. The Carnahan Conference has provided an important venue for the introduction of new sensor technologies as they emerge from R&D, are tested by various agencies, and are introduced into the “real world” of outdoor security. The harsh realities of the outdoor environment and the wide range of threats faced by these sensors provide many challenges that have been the topic of many of the learned papers. The Carnahan conference provides an opportunity for the users of the technology to relate their experience to those who wish to introduce new technologies. Through the sponsorship of the IEEE these papers form a unique point of reference for the development of new sensors. Forty years ago most of the important players were large aerospace companies. Many of the sensor technologies used in perimeter security evolved from military developments. As one of the dominant users of perimeter security equipment, the US military sponsored much of this early development. This “mil-spec” environment had a profound effect on these developments which in many cases has survived to this day and is part of the heritage of the present world on outdoor perimeter security. These companies gave way to a number of small “spin-off” one product co- panies where the technologies were exploited. More recently most of one product companies have merged into larger “one-stop-shopping” companies. This paper describes the many changes in technology, the business models and the user community over the past 40 years and concludes with a prediction as to what the next 10 years will bring.",1071-6572,978-1-4673-2450-2,978-1-4673-2449-6,10.1109/CCST.2012.6393530,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393530,,Companies;Government;Industries;Military aircraft;Security;Sensor systems,military equipment;national security;sensors,Carnahan Conference;IEEE sponsorship;US military;VIP residents;aerospace companies;business models;critical assets;forty year perspective;high-tech world;mil-spec environment;military developments;one-stop-shopping companies;outdoor environment;outdoor perimeter security sensors;perimeter security equipment;sensor technology;slow-tech world;threats;user community,,0,,13,,,15-18 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.",,978-1-4244-9879-6,978-0-7695-4330-7,10.1109/POLICY.2011.34,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791,,Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software,fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces,fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy,,1,,23,,,6-8 June 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,,

Cyber/physical security vulnerability assessment integration,"Macdonald, D.; Clements, S.L.; Patrick, S.W.; Perkins, C.; Muller, G.; Lancaster, M.J.; Hutton, W.","Pacific Northwest Nat. Lab. Richland, Richland, WA, USA","Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT), 2013 IEEE PES",20130415,2013,,,1,6,"Securing high value and critical assets is one of the biggest challenges facing this nation and others around the world. In modern integrated systems, there are four potential modes of attack available to an adversary: 1 physical only attack, 2 cyber only attack, 3 physical-enabled cyber attack, 4 cyber-enabled physical attack. Blended attacks involve an adversary working in one domain to reduce system effectiveness in another domain. This enables the attacker to penetrate further into the overall layered defenses. Existing vulnerability assessment (VA) processes and software tools which predict facility vulnerabilities typically evaluate the physical and cyber domains separately. Vulnerabilities which result from the integration of cyber-physical control systems are not well characterized and are often overlooked by existing assessment approaches. In this paper, we modified modification of the timely detection methodology, used for decades in physical security VAs, to include cyber components. The Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool (PACRAT) prototype illustrates an integrated vulnerability assessment that includes cyber-physical interdependencies. Information about facility layout, network topology, and emplaced safeguards is used to evaluate how well suited a facility is to detect, delay, and respond to attacks, to identify the pathways most vulnerable to attack, and to evaluate how often safeguards are compromised for a given threat or adversary type. We have tested the PACRAT prototype on critical infrastructure facilities and the results are promising.
