The marked information is used to reconstruct the IP address of the ingress router connected to the attack source at the detecting end. The work is deployed in the programmable routers in real time and the attack source detection mechanisms are carried out. Attack sources are detected from the marked information in the IP header of the packet. As the detection scheme relies only on the marked information in the IP header fields, the source of the spoofed packets can also be accurately identified.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972268","DDoS attacks;attack source identification;packet marking;programmable routers","Computer crime;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Probabilistic logic;Real time systems;Workstations","computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDoS attack;IP header field;IP spoofing;attack source detection mechanism;attack source identification;distributed denial of service attack;marking algorithm;packet marking scheme;programmable router;router information;router level","","4","","7","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models. The proposed index policies apply to a more general case where a subset (more than one) of the components can be probed simultaneously. The problem under study also finds applications in spectrum scanning in cognitive radio networks and event detection in sensor networks.","1053-587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2014.2332982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844162","Anomaly localization;composite hypothesis testing;sequential hypothesis testing;sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)","Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Delays;Indexes;Optimization;Search problems;Testing","indexing;probability;reliability;resource allocation;security of data","anomalous components;anomaly localization;cognitive radio networks;event detection;optimal index policies;probing strategy;reliability constraints;resource-constrained cyber systems;sensor networks;spectrum scanning","","3","","32","","2014-06-25","Aug.15, 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This stimulated our research to make use of the limited computational capabilities of these sensor nodes to build a normal model of the data gathered. Hence by having the normal model, anomalies can then be detected and forwarded to a central location. This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks. In this paper the Data Capture Anomalies Detection is used to partition the data and then send all the data to a central server for data classification, building on the Data Capture Anomalies Detection method and in order to classify the partitioned data, our algorithm Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection sends anomalies (2%) as well as roughly (2% or 4%) of normal data for further data processing and classification purposes.

The goal is to efficiently establish acceptable trust levels among mobile nodes without prior interactions. We seek to identify the optimal length of a trust chain among peers in a trust Web so as to maximize the trust levels for peers on the trust chain, by trading off trust space for trust level. The cognitive nodes in the network can dynamically adapt to changing network environments by adjusting their design parameter settings over time to establish an acceptable trust level with other nodes. We define a trust metric that captures unique characteristics of trust concepts in such MANETs. We demonstrate that an optimal trust chain exists for maximizing the trust metric.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283838","cognitive networks;hierarchical modeling;mobile ad hoc networks;reliability.;social networks;stochastic Petri nets;trust chain;trust management;trust metric","Collaboration;Communication system security;Decision making;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Petri nets;Protocols;Routing;Topology","Petri nets;ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;mobile radio;peer-to-peer computing;stochastic processes","MANET;cognitive mission-driven group communication system;cryptography;hierarchical modeling techniques;mobile ad hoc network;peer to peer network;stochastic Petri net;trust Web;trust management protocol","","16","","24","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When network function virtualization (NFV) is enabled, virtualized NFs (vNF) can be placed when and where needed. In this study, we identify the possibility of minimizing the expensive optical/electronic/optical (O/E/O) conversions for NFV chaining in packet/optical datacenters, which is introduced by the on-demand placement of vNFs. When the vNFs of the same NF chain are properly grouped into fewer pods, traffic flows can avoid unnecessary traversals in the optical domain. We formulate the problem of optimal vNF placement in binary integer programming (BIP), and propose an alternative efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this problem. Evaluation results show that our algorithm can achieve near-optimal O/E/O conversions comparable to BIP. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under various scenarios, with comparison to a simple first-fit algorithm.","0733-8724","","","10.1109/JLT.2015.2388585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005460","Datacenter;datacenter;network function placement;network function virtualization;optical;service chaining","Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Middleboxes;Noise measurement;Optical fiber networks;Optical packet switching;Optical switches","computer centres;integer programming;optical fibre networks;optical wavelength conversion;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","BIP;NFV;NFV chaining;binary integer programming;expensive optical-electronic-optical conversions;heuristic algorithm;near-optimal O/E/O conversions;network function placement;network function virtualization;packet-based fine-grained traffic steering schemes;packet-optical data centers;traffic flows;vNF","","1","","14","","2015-01-09","April15, 15 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Confidentiality is the most important point of information security with respect to integrity and availability in cloud computing especially in financial, governmental and military usage. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) service increases the cloud's security level. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system. At the same time, users can also manage and monitor their own confidentiality by themselves.","","978-1-4673-5612-1","","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557202","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Authentication;Computational modeling;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Military computing;Monitoring","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;trusted computing;virtual machines","AdjointVM;circular chain VM protection model;cloud administrators;cloud computing security level;cloud providers;corporate areas;external threats;host-based IDS;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;information security;internal threats;intrusion detection system service;private areas;trusted computing;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees;virtual machine monitor-based IDS","","2","","16","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these documents do not provide much guidance about recognizing potential problems or about preventative measures. Even so, it is apparent that knowingly tolerating dishonesty or incompetence within the corporation is likely to be regarded as negligence. Most organizations today pay little attention to the inter-relationship between the Formal component, Technical component and Informal component. The Board and senior management of organizations tend to focus more on narrow aspects such as ISIIT management rather than on a comprehensive view. Deficiencies in any of these three components may result in unbalanced IS/IT security implementation. The objective of this study is to integrate the three components simultaneously throughout the IS/IT security implementation. The model of IS/IT security governance is a comprehensive conceptual framework because it emphasizes the two-way relationship between each of the components. In this study, a triangulated approach is adopted, data were collected in three phases, phase 1 is a website analysis, phase 2 is an interview and phase 3 is a mail survey.

In communication systems buffering is commonly used to mitigate in real time multimedia applications at the expense of an additional delay. This method is therefore not suitable for control systems implemented over packet switched communication networks due to the additional delay which can make the system unstable. Hence, jitter modelling and management is necessary. This paper focuses on the development and experimental verification of a suitable jitter model for wireless and wired network bottlenecks. The effects of jitter are then investigated by quantifying the performance of a simulated Networked Control System (NCS). According to the results, the reduction in attenuation due to jitter compared to a jitter free benchmark ranges from approximately 0.01-0.04dB depending on the encoding type.","","978-1-4799-7731-4","","10.1109/ICTER.2014.7083907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083907","Networked control systems;communication networks;cyber-physical systems;delay variation;self similarity","Attenuation;Communication networks;Delays;Encoding;Jitter;Networked control systems;Wireless communication","jitter;networked control systems;packet switching;radio networks","NCS;attenuation reduction;buffering;delay variation;empirical network jitter measurements;encoding type;jitter management;jitter modelling;multimedia applications;networked control system simulation;packet switched communication networks;wired network bottleneck;wireless network bottleneck","","0","","35","","","10-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a design and proof-of-concept implementation of a packet processing system that uses two security techniques to defend against potential attacks: a processing monitor is used to track operations on each processor core to detect attacks at the processing instruction level; an I/O monitor is used to track operations of the router to detect attacks at the protocol level.

It is difficult to prevent because DDoS attacker send spoofing packets to victim which makes the identification of the origin of attacks very difficult. A series of techniques have been studied such as pattern matching by learning the attack pattern and abnormal traffic detection. However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks. Moreover, the amount of traffic flowing through the Internet increase rapidly and thus packet analysis should be done within considerable amount of time. This paper proposes a scalable, real-time traffic pattern analysis based on genetic algorithm to detect and prevent DDoS attacks on Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scalable DDoS protection system.","","","","10.1109/CEC.2015.7257075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7257075","DDoS attack;Genetic Algorithm;Hadoop","Accuracy;Computer crime;Distributed processing;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;IP networks;Sparks","computer network security;data handling;genetic algorithms;parallel processing;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack prevention;Hadoop cluster computing framework;Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure;Internet security;distributed denial-of-service attack protection system;genetic algorithms;scalable DDoS protection system;spoofing packets;traffic pattern analysis","","","","22","","","25-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on our previous proposed TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) anomaly detection method, which can detect anomalies with high detection rate and low false positive rate, we develop an instance selection mechanism for TCM-KNN based on EFCM (Extended Fuzzy C-Means) clustering algorithm in this paper, aiming at limiting the size of training dataset, thus reducing the computational cost of TCM-KNN and boosting its detection performance.

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The problem is how to overcome the known limitations of current wireless sensor networks to support multimedia applications in terms of throughput, delay and jitter while being energy efficient. This paper presents LEMR-multichannel, an extension of LEMR for real-time applications over wireless sensor networks to address these issues. LEMR-multichannel takes advantage of the delay, jitter and energy-efficiency of LEMR, and includes an energyefficient new dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism that uses the different channels available in the single transceiver device to enhance the throughput capability of the network.

Sleep deprivation attack is one of the most interesting attack in layer 2 where the attacker tries to use a low energy node until all its energy is exhausted and the node goes into permanent sleep. This attack is also possible in routing level. In OLSR low energy node declare their status through willingness property of HELLO message.

First, we provide a simulation of MPEG-4 using OPNET over the WLANs in terms of throughput, impacts of multiple MPEG-4 streams, and compression rate on throughput. Our simulation results show that a higher throughput does not always yield a better quality MPEG-4 video. We further observe that if an I frame of MPEG 4 video is lost, the next N-1 frames (all P and B frames) are useless [where N is the total number of frames contained within one group of picture (GoP)]. Furthermore, we observe that the I, P, and B frames are in decreasing order of importance. Therefore, we propose a cross-layer approach to improve MPEG-4 trans missions over WLANs. In the proposed approach: 1) P and B frames will be discarded by the MPEG-4 decoder at the receiver's medium access control (MAC) layer if the corresponding I fame is lost; 2) the individual MPEG-4 frames are prioritized at the MAC layer so that I frames have a higher priority than P frames, which have a higher priority than the B frames; 3) each frame (I, B, P) has a time deadline field so that if the deadline cannot be reached, the frame and other related P and B frames in the same GoP are deleted without further transmissions/re-transmissions; and 4) if the delay between an I frame and the next P frame is too long, then it may be better to drop the least important B frames in an attempt to allow the video to catch up. Finally, we study MPEG-4 transmissions over the IEEE 802.11e WLANs, and we adopt a measurement admission control scheme for IEEE 802.lie.

In general, these network attacks can be detected by deploying network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) to the cloud platform. As clients in the cloud can create many virtual machines (VMs) to run their services privately, all detection rules are usually loaded into NIDSs to avoid any oversight, and cause damage to the performance of NIDS. This work presents a new architecture for building an efficient NIDS to the cloud virtualization environment. By resolving the virtual system information from operating systems' kernel map in hypervisor layer, the services in the cloud can be identified exactly and the required detection rules can be adopted dynamically.

IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks.

However for a developer or team working on any network project who need to perform DPI, there is always the issue of using a third party source which may involve added cost or implementing it themselves which requires time and study of protocols, signatures and the nuances of pattern matching. The paper proposes a solution to the above problem using an adaptive grammar generation algorithm. This method reduces the entropy among similar results given by different patterns. Immense customizability is the foremost advantage of this method. Existing grammars for new signatures can be combined into a single grammar easily rather than new grammars be generated from raw target strings. The paper, thus, looks to limit the detailed knowledge requirement for the design of signature detection procedures and in doing so re-use existing procedures which have been thoroughly debugged and tested.","","978-1-4673-0060-5","","10.1109/EMS.2011.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6131199","Deep Packet Inspection;Grammar;Pattern Matching;Regular Expressions","Educational institutions;Entropy;Grammar;Inspection;Pattern matching;Production;Protocols","grammars;pattern matching;security of data","DPI;DoS;IDS;adaptive grammar generation;adaptive pattern matching;deep packet inspection;denial of service;entropy;immense customizability;intrusion detection system;signature detection procedure","","0","","6","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","10","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system.

It is based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions will be detectable. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are usually deployed along with other preventive security mechanisms, such as access control and authentication, as a second line of defense that protects information systems. There are several reasons that make intrusion detection a necessary part of the entire defense system.

It is immense challenge for researcher to protect the mobile ad hoc network from the malicious node as topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious node can easily inject false routes into the network. A traditional method to detect such malicious nodes is to establish a base profile of normal network behavior and then identify a node's behavior to be anomalous if it deviates from the established profile. As the topology of a MANET constantly changes over time, the simple use of a static base profile is not efficient. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to detect the malicious node in MANET. In proposed method k-means clustering-based anomaly detection approach is used in which the profile is dynamically updated. The approach consists of three main phases: training, testing and updating. In training phase, the K-means clustering algorithm is used in order to establish a normal profile. In testing phase, check whether the current traffic of the node is normal or anomalous. If it is normal then update the normal profile otherwise isolate the malicious node and ignore that node from the network. To update the normal profile periodically, weighted coefficients and a forgetting equation is used.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155836","Dynamic Intrusion Detection System;K-means clustering;MANET","Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Testing;Training","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection approach;dynamic learning;intrusion detection approach;k-means clustering;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc network;network data;novel framework;security system;static base profile;surveillance system;topology node","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel FPGA-based, programmable IP flow monitor is presented, that permits various forms of network monitoring functionality, specifically monitoring of different classes of traffic, to be performed. A key aspect was to address the traditionally long design times, through the use of a new, experimental, high-level design flow called Packet Xpress which allowed functions to be quickly implemented, providing a twentyfold speed-up in design time. The monitor has been implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 based ML506 board and verified in hardware using real Internet traffic traces.

This paper concerns using rough set for attribution ranking and reducing and using support vector machine for intrusion detection classification. An elicitation attribution reduction algorithm (EARA) based on attribution significance and discernibility matrix is presented and three data discretization algorithms were applied to identify the important attributions. The classification performance of the presented algorithm and classical SVM were compared in accuracy, time, false positive rate, and detection rate.

Intrusion detection was fulfilled by comparing the strings of audit data with immune detectors. Experiments were designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we show a test-bed that we have developed to detect vulnerabilities within SCADA protocols against internal attacks in order to find out how easy it is to bypass security measures in such protocols. Furthermore, we have tested SCADA components to assess their vulnerabilities against the following attacks: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, replay attacks, cryptographic attacks, and fragmentation attacks.

In this work, instead of constructing a large number of features from massive network traffic, the authors aim to select the most important features and use them to detect intrusions in a fast and effective manner. The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

Thus, based on the specified problems, the purpose of our overall research is to construct a holistic solution that is able to reduce the number of alerts to be processed and at the same time to produce a high quality attack scenarios that are meaningful to the administrators in a timely manner.

Computer networks are typically built from a large number of network devices such as routers, switches and numerous types of middle boxes with many complex protocols implemented on them. They need to accomplish very complex tasks with access to very limited tools. As a result, network management and performance tuning is quite challenging. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture purporting to be adaptable, cost-effective, dynamic and manageable pursuing to be suitable for the high-bandwidth, changing nature of today's applications. SDN architectures decouples network control and forwarding functions, making network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted from applications and network services. The network security is a prominent feature of the network ensuring accountability, confidentiality, integrity, and protection against many external and internal threats. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a type of security software designed to automatically alert administrators when someone or something is trying to compromise information system through malicious activities or through security policy violations. Security violation in SDN environment needs to be identified to prevent the system from an attack. The proposed work aims to detect the attacks on SDN environment.

The majority of the data-plane traffic is distributed via the switch's built-in traffic distribution function and no connection state is kept. If the load balancing controller detects a skew in the load of the DPP appliances, it updates the traffic rules in the switch to redirect new connections to less busy DPP appliances. This adaptive solution is beneficial for load-balancing at high data rates because state is kept for only the redirected connections. For typical traffic patterns, our solution reduces the packet drops with minimal connection redirection. We show an example capture, where we are able to improve the packet drop rate by 94.8% with only 3% of the connections being redirected.","1944-0367","978-1-4577-1264-7","","10.1109/LANMAN.2011.6076946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076946","","Clocks;Hardware;Home appliances;IP networks;Servers;Switches","local area networks;resource allocation","DPP;Ethernet switch;adaptive load balancing;data plane traffic;deep packet processing;high performing scaleout solution;load balancing controller;traffic distribution function","","0","","7","","","13-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Industry and academies adopt the network security enabled hypervisor (NSE-H) to protect virtual machines (VM) residing in the virtual network. In this paper, we identified the insufficiency of the existing live migration implementation, which prevents itself from providing transparent VM relocation between NSE-Hs. This occurs because the contemporary migration implementation only takes VM encapsulated states into account, but ignores VM related security context(SC) needed by NSE-H embedded security engines (SE). We presented a comprehensive live migration framework for the NSE-H, considering both the execution context encapsulated in VM instance and the VM related security context within the SEs. We built a prototype system of the framework based on stateful firewall enabled Xen hypervisor. Our experiment was performed with realistic applications and the results demonstrate that the solution complements the insufficiency without introducing significant performance downgrade. Even in the worst case, the downtime that occurs during migration increases no more than 15%, comparing to existing implementation.","","978-1-4244-4590-5","978-1-4244-4591-2","10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5347800","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5347800","hypervisor;live migration;network security;virtualization","Computer networks;Engines;Hardware;Platform virtualization;Protection;Resource virtualization;Space technology;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing","authorisation;computer networks;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","NSE-H;SE;VM execution context encapsulation;contemporary migration framework;efficiency 15 percent;embedded security engine;multiple operating system;network security enhanced hypervisor;network-base security device;prototype system;stateful firewall enabled Xen hypervisor;system virtualization technology;transparent VM relocation;virtual computing environment;virtual machine live migration","","4","1","21","","","18-20 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The various personal information sharing practices that social network providers promote have led to their success as innovative social interaction platforms. At the same time, these practices have risen much critique and concerns with respect to privacy and security from different stakeholders. In fact, the massive use of online social networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way, every social network user should be able to easily access, control and analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated to it. The proposed event collector framework can collect all posted information and store it in a relational database for further analysis. Using a friendly graphical interface, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user behaviour. Since each event is stored with its corresponding timestamp, it is possible to perform an efficient analysis of all posted contents, compute statistics over collected data, infer/establish the so called ""normal"" or ""typical"" usage profile and, thus, be able to detect possible deviations that may correspond to a compromised user account.","","","","10.1109/NETWKS.2014.6959218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6959218","Monitoring Framework;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Databases;Facebook;Privacy;Security;Servers;Web pages","graphical user interfaces;relational databases;social networking (online)","daily digital interactions;graphical user interface;innovative social interaction platforms;relational database;social network events collection;user behaviour analysis","","0","","11","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To evaluate the performance of the algorithm correctly classified instances, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Root relative squared error and kappa statistics measures are applied.","2151-7681","978-1-4673-1988-1","","10.1109/WOCN.2012.6335546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335546","Intrusion detection system (IDS);J48 algorithm;classification;data mining","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","computer network security;data mining;feature extraction;mean square error methods;pattern classification;statistical analysis","IDS;J48 classification algorithm;KDD Cup 99;MAE;RMSE;data mining;feature classification;feature identification;feature selection;intrusion attack classification;intrusion detection system;kappa statistic measures;mean absolute error;network security management;root mean squared error;root relative squared error","","1","","16","","","20-22 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security and privacy is a major hurdle in its success because of its open and distributed architecture that is vulnerable to intruders. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the most commonly used mechanism to detect attacks on cloud. This paper provides an overview of different intrusions in cloud. Then, we analyze some existing cloud based intrusion detection systems (IDS) with respect to their type, positioning, detection time, detection technique, data source and attacks they can detect. The analysis also provides limitations of each technique to evaluate whether they fulfill the security requirements of cloud computing environment or not. We emphasize the deployment of IDS that uses multiple detection methods to cope with security challenges in cloud.","","978-1-4799-1287-2","","10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725325","Anomaly;Cloud Computing;Cloud Security;Intrusion Detection System;Signature","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Servers;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;computer crime;data privacy","IDS;IT organization;attacks detection;cloud based intrusion detection systems;cloud computing;data source;detection technique;detection time;distributed architecture;open architecture;pay-per-use based services;positioning;privacy;security requirements","","1","","29","","","11-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|Σ|×p<sup>2</sup>×(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where Σ is the alphabet and c ≥ 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9919-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986","Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching","NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","","11","","26","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One-class SVM is a kernel based approach which is very fast and precise and therefore is used in different fields such as image processing, protein classification and anomaly detection for statistical learning. There are some approaches suggested for anomaly detection in MANETs that most of them are static and use a predefined model. Due to the dynamic characteristics of MANETs, they cannot be applied to these networks well. In this paper we have proposed a one-class SVM for dynamic anomaly detection in mobile ad-hoc networks with AODV routing protocol, called ManetSVM. The efficiency of ManetSVM for detection of flooding, blackhole, neighbour, rushing, and wormhole attacks has been evaluated. Simulation results show that ManetSVM is able to achieve a better balance between Detection Rate and False alarm Rate in comparison with other dynamic anomaly detection approaches.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767325","Anomaly detection;Mobile ad-hoc network;One-class classification;Statistical learning;Support vector machine","Ad hoc networks;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;statistical analysis;support vector machines","MANET;ManetSVM;blackhole;detection of flooding;detection rate;dynamic anomaly detection;false alarm rate;one-class classification;one-class support vector machine;routing protocol;statistical learning;wormhole attacks","","0","","15","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Safe operations can be enhanced by correctly designed device-level control algorithms as well as protocols, procedures, and operator training at the control-room level, but all of these can fail. Moreover, these elements exchange data and issue commands via vulnerable communication layers. To secure these gaps and enhance operational safety, the authors believe command sequence monitoring must be combined with an awareness of physical device limitations and automata models that capture safety mechanisms. One way of doing this is by leveraging specification-based intrusion detection to monitor for physical constraint violations. This method can also verify that the physical infrastructure state is consistent with information and commands exchanged by controllers. This additional security layer enhances protection from both outsider attacks and insider mistakes.","1540-7993","","","10.1109/MSP.2014.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7006406","cyber-physical system;energy system;intrusion detection;physics;safety engineering;security;specifications","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Control systems;Energy management;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Safety;Safety devices","control facilities;networked control systems;security of data","command sequence monitoring;control centers;correctly designed device-level control algorithms;embedded controllers;networked control system security monitoring;operations safety;physical device safety;security layer;specification-based intrusion detection;vulnerable communication layers","","0","","17","","","Nov.-Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many applications, it is important to take into account some extra knowledge in addition to the one encoded by the classifier. For example, in spam filtering which can be seen as a classification problem, it can make sense for a user to require that the spam filter predicts less than a given rate or number of spams. In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as ""it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal"" can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise classifiers' outputs in order to fit the expert knowledge. Experimental studies on intrusion detection and alert correlation problems show that our approach improves the performances on different benchmarks.","1082-3409","978-1-4799-0227-9","","10.1109/ICTAI.2012.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6495080","Decision trees;alert correlation;expert knowledge;intrusion detection","Bayes methods;Context;Correlation;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution","decision trees;pattern classification;security of data;statistical distributions","alert correlation;classification problem;decision tree classifier;expert knowledge;intrusion detection;probability distribution;spam filtering","","0","","32","","","7-9 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It acts as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) for the human body and detects anomalies that make the body deviate from its normal behavior. This inspired researchers to build artificial immune systems (AISes) which imitate the behavior of the HIS and are capable of protecting hosts or networks from attacks. An artificial immune system (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period. Although several AISes have been proposed, only a few make use of collaborative approaches. In this paper we propose P2P-AIS, a P2P approach for AISes in which peers exchange intrusion detection experience in order to enhance attack detection and mitigation. P2P-AIS implements Chord as a distributed hash table (DHT) protocol to organize the peers.","","978-1-4244-4623-0","978-1-4244-4624-7","10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5307053","artificial immune systems;distributed denial of service;intrusion detection;peer-to-peer systems","Artificial immune systems;Broadcasting;Computer crime;Computer science;Error correction;Floods;Humans;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols","artificial immune systems;cryptographic protocols;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Chord;DDoS flooding attacks;P2P-AIS;artificial immune system;distributed hash table protocol;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention system","","0","","20","","","23-26 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
