The detection module uses PCA technique to accumulate interested statistical variables and compares them with the thresholds derived from users activities data. When the variables exceed the estimated thresholds, an alarm is raised to alert about a possible intrusion in the network.

A novel approach for enhanced intrusion detection system for malicious node is proposed here to protect against attacks in ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol. The proposed approach employs a method for determining conditions under which malicious node should be monitored. Apart from identification of malicious node, it has been observed that this approach leads to less conservation and less communication breakage in ad hoc routing.

The paper first provides an overview of the architecture and how it compares to the well-established TCP/IP model. The architecture's network forensic features are then considered. The architecture's approach to naming and addressing fundamentally differs from the approach used in the current Internet. Great care is taken to distinguish between names and addresses. Names are used to identify entities and generally have a large scope. Addresses, however, are used to locate entities within a limited scope and are consequently not necessarily globally significant. These properties in particular create additional challenges when capturing and analysing network traffic as evidence. The paper shows that the architecture is well-suited for a distributed systems approach to forensics and that the network architecture increases the potential sources of reliable evidence.","","978-1-4577-1481-8","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027506","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027506","Future Internet;RINA;digital forensics","Computer architecture;Forensics;Internet;Protocols;Relays;Resource management;Routing","IP networks;Internet;computer forensics;transport protocols","TCP/IP model;architecture network forensic;clean slate Internet architecture;distributed systems approach;network forensic implication;network traffic analysis","","0","","15","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

GNP is an evolutionary optimization techniques, which uses directed graph structures as genes instead of strings (Genetic Algorithm) or trees (Genetic Programming), leading to creating compact programs and implicitly memorizing past action sequences. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database which contains both discrete and continuous attributes.

Hierarchically clustering technique is able to help IDS operators to get meaningful overviews from the great number of alarms. A dilemma is encountered when the clusters are generated. If the clusters are obtained one by one, they cannot be prevented from overlapping each other, which makes it quite likely to mislead the operator, if they are obtained in a batch, the total number of clusters must be guessed before clustering, which indicates possibly imprecise cluster number or repeated running. In this paper, we propose a GA (genetic algorithm)-based approach in which vary-lengthed chromosomes are adopted instead of fixed-lengthed chromosomes. The encoding scheme is that different numbers of clusters are encoded into different lengths of chromosomes. In addition, the other genetic operations such as selection, crossover and mutation, are discussed in detail. Results from several experiments are quite encouraging, including that the newly proposed approach is able to efficiently generate fitful number of clusters of high quality in a batch.","","978-1-4244-8627-4","","10.1109/ISIP.2010.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669026","genetic algorithm;hierarchical clustering;intrusion detection system;vary-lengthed chromosome","Approximation algorithms;Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Equations;Gallium;Humans","biology computing;cellular biophysics;genetic algorithms;pattern clustering;security of data","GA;encoding scheme;hierarchically clustering technique;intrusion detection systems;vary-lengthed chromosomes","","0","","11","","","15-17 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), efficiently identifying the botnet in time can be a challenge. Recently, the unsupervised learning methods such as the K-means, self-organizing map (SOM), and growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) have been shown to be able to facilitate network anomaly detection. However, there is no study focusing on mining IP flows with high variability of attacks in an intuitive way. In this study, we leverage the visualization specialty of GHSOM to help analyze the static IP flow data, also called the network traces of victims, to identify any suspicious IP source. The GHSOM can generate a hierarchical architecture based on the input data and help reveal their inherent hierarchical relationships. For example, the geometric distances between each attack pattern and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space which forms the signature of a botnet. The IP flows clustered by GHSOM are grouped with distinctive connecting features, and the differences between each cluster are visualized with sequential time stamps which can be used to portray various attack patterns, help explore the sources of attacks and understand the behaviors of attacks. The experimental results from real-world traffic data show that forensic analysis using GHSOM can efficiently identify several DDoS attack patterns and generate filtering rules for intrusion detection system (IDS) by further inspecting and book marking the suspicious IP sources.","","978-1-4799-3143-9","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753967","Data clustering;Feature extraction;Network anomaly detection;Network forensics;Neural networks","Data visualization;Filtering;Forensics;IP networks;Internet;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","IP networks;computer network security;data analysis;data visualisation;digital forensics;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","Botnet;GHSOM visualization specialty;IDS;IP sources;K-means;attack pattern detection;book marking;distributed denial of service attack;filtering rule generation;geometric distances;growing hierarchical SOM;growing hierarchical self-organizing map;hierarchical architecture;intrusion detection system;network anomaly detection;network forensic analysis;network traffic data;real-world traffic data;sequential time stamps;several DDoS attack patterns;static IP flow data analysis;topological space;unsupervised learning methods;victim network traces","","0","","14","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It detects malicious activities by monitoring network traffic. There are two main classes of IDS: the anomaly-based IDS and signature-based IDS. An important challenge, for signature-based IDS, is automating attack signature writing from traffic logs, which can be very hard to be established for human administrator. In this paper, we propose a solution addressing this challenge. We propose cloud-based signature learning service using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Learning service generates rule describing properties shared by packets labelled as malicious and that do not cover normal packets. The system uses a background knowledge composed of predicates used to describe network attack signature. The cloud architecture of our IDS enables it to have specialized nodes.

A new intrusion detection system named bandwidth shared acknowledgment (BSA) in which all transmission packet data and acknowledge should be cryptographically signed. Swarm Based Detection techniques for multiple paths establishment among source to destination and random casting is use during intrusion in MANETs. Eavesdropping in MANET is scheduled based on number of acknowledgement received at every instance in network. The theme of this paper is to provide a seamless message delivery in a MANET despite its threats using random casting and the existing mechanisms like 2-hop acknowledgement or source directed acknowledgement does not hold when a network topology changes frequently or when a node is compromised. These drawbacks are to be addressed ensuring secured connecting edges between source and destination. The source collision, exposure to vulnerability is also minimized using this mechanism. We propose an optimize solution for above problem using BSA techniques which overcomes eaves dropping based on acknowledgement from intermediate only.","","978-1-4799-3835-3","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033819","Bandwidth Shared Acknowledgment (BSA);Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET);Random Casting;Swarm Detection","Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Casting;Delays;Digital signatures;Mobile computing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;safety systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","2-hop acknowledgement;BSA techniques;MANET protection;bandwidth shared acknowledgment;connecting edges security;cryptography;eavesdropping;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing;multiple path establishment;network topology;node decentralization;node open medium;node wide distribution;random casting;seamless message delivery;secure intrusion detection system efficiency;source collision;source directed acknowledgement;swarm based detection techniques;transmission packet data","","0","","9","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this paper is to show a forecasting approach which could be aggregated to common ROSI methods. In this study, forecasting approach is based on two trend techniques: moving averages and Fibonacci sequence - for security incidents with intrusion detection system (IDS) and unwanted Internet traffic.

Obtaining an optimal IDS configuration for effective detection of attacks is far from trivial. There exists a tradeoff between security enforcement levels and the performance of information systems. It is critical to configure an IDS in a dynamic and iterative fashion to balance the security overhead and system performance. In this paper, we use noncooperative game approaches to address this problem. We first build a fundamental game framework to model the zero-sum interactions between the detector and the attacker. Building on this platform, we then formulate a stochastic game model in which the transitions between system states are determined by the actions chosen by both players. An optimal policy-based configuration can be found by minimizing a discounted cost criterion, using an iterative method. In addition, we propose a Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal game values when the transitions between system states are unknown. We show the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal Q-function and illustrate the concepts by simulation.","0191-2216","978-1-4244-3871-6","978-1-4244-3872-3","10.1109/CDC.2009.5399894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5399894","","Convergence;Cost function;Detectors;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Stochastic systems;System performance","computer network security;game theory;security of data","Q-learning algorithm;attacks detection;discounted cost criterion;dynamic policy based IDS configuration;game framework;information systems performance;intrusion detection system;iterative method;networked information systems;noncooperative game;optimal IDS configuration;optimal game values;optimal policy based configuration;security enforcement level;security enforcement tool;security overhead;stochastic game model;system performance;zero-sum interaction","","8","","23","","","15-18 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, a bifurcation appears when time delay t passes a constant value which means that the worm propagation system is unstable and uncontrollable. Thus, the time delay should be decreased in order to predict or eliminate the worm propagation.

P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions. Lastly, a preliminary evaluation of the run-time overhead is discussed.","1066-6192","978-0-7695-3544-9","","10.1109/PDP.2009.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4912959","introspection;intrusion detection system;sense of self;static analysis;virtual machines","Condition monitoring;Law;Legal factors;Libraries;Protection;Robustness;Runtime;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing","context-free grammars;operating system kernels;program diagnostics;virtual machines","PsycoTrace run-time tool;assertion evaluation;context-free grammar;introspection tool;legal trace;operating system kernel module;source code;static analysis;system call;transparent process self monitoring;virtual machine;virtual process self monitoring","","1","","16","","","18-20 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This IDS enables nodes to detect whether their next node on a path flow forwards correctly packets or not by overhearing its transmissions. However, as Watchdog does not consider the packet loss ratio, it can lead to false positives. Indeed, a node can accuse another node of misbehaving whereas in reality it suffers from link loss. In order to overcome this issue, we propose an extension scheme to the Watchdog IDS which enables a node to determine whether it does not overhear its next node due to packet loss issue or due to misbehavior. To reach this goal, we assume that malicious nodes drop both acknowledgements and forwarded packets with different frequencies. Thus, our scheme compares the distribution of a node's acknowledgment with its distribution of forwarded packets of data to detect misbehaving nodes. Furthermore, we extend our scheme so that it enables a node to monitor both its next node and its previous node on a flow path.","","978-1-4673-6425-6","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632124","","Mobile computing;Multiaccess communication;Packet loss;Random variables;Vectors;Wireless mesh networks","security of data;trusted computing;wireless mesh networks","Watchdog IDS;Watchdog extension;intrusion detection system;link loss;malicious nodes;packet loss;reputation system;trust system;wireless mesh network","","1","","11","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our architecture-based analysis is different from most other approaches to analyzing complex systems in that it addresses multiple quality attributes simultaneously (e.g., performance, reliability, security, modifiability, usability, etc.) and it considers the architecture of a complex system from a socio-technical perspective where the actions of the people in the system are as important, from an analysis perspective, as the physical and computational elements of the system.

To date, however, no published work has evaluated identity-only obfuscation approaches against using IPsec ESP tunnels as a way of hiding endpoint identities. The question is, are there some network configurations where identity-only obfuscation techniques work better than IPsec ESP tunnels? We present arguments that low-overhead MTN identity-only obfuscation approaches may work more efficiently on wireless mobile, tactical, peer-to-peer networks where processing energies and transmission bandwidth are constrained and we also discuss features of metrics for measuring the success of moving target network approaches, helping to guide future research in this area.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-1729-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415740","","Bandwidth;Encryption;IP networks;Logic gates;Payloads","IP networks;computer networks","IPsec ESP tunnels;MTN techniques;computer networks;identity-only obfuscation techniques;moving target network;moving target networks;network reconnaissance steps;organization internal network;peer-to-peer networks;tactical networks;wireless mobile","","0","","20","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not straight forward to apply most of the anomaly detection techniques to IoT and cloud. One of the main challenges is deriving outlier features from the vast volume of data pumped from IoT to the cloud. Other challenges include the large number of sources generating data, heterogenous connectivity and traffic patterns of IoT devices, cloud services being offered at geographically remote places and causing IoT data to be stored in different countries with different legislations.

In terms of information security, incrementing the intrusion detection rate on anomaly attacks and decreasing the high false positive rate has been the two major concerns for every sysadmin. The huge amount of logs generated by different assets in the network are not always capable to be correlated and reviewed to determine possible security breaches. We implemented a new reliable and scalable classification-based hybrid IPS that can easily manage the processing of all the authentication log information of different IPSs in the network. This enhanced framework can determine in a more precise manner if a communication can be considered legitimate or an intrusion. This classification method increases the intrusion detection rate and decreases the false positive rate. Our main objective in this paper is to enforce redundancy on different modules of the framework. Our results show that a framework with these features can be easily deployed in networks to ensure reliable security.","","978-1-4799-1774-7","","10.1109/WAINA.2015.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096243","classification-based hybrid ips;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;ips;mongodb;reliable ips;scalabe ips;syslog","Collaboration;Correlation;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Reliability;Servers","computer network security;telecommunication network reliability","anomaly attacks;authentication log information;computer network security;false positive rate;hybrid IPS;information security reliability;intrusion detection rate;intrusion prevention systems;reliable classification;reliable security;scalable classification","","0","","14","","","24-27 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, an intrusion detection system would reduce the number of false positives if, in addition to the alarm, the system would also transmitted a picture or video of the intruder. The problem is how to overcome the known limitations of current wireless sensor networks to support multimedia applications in terms of throughput, delay and jitter while being energy efficient. This paper presents LEMR-multichannel, an extension of LEMR for real-time applications over wireless sensor networks to address these issues. LEMR-multichannel takes advantage of the delay, jitter and energy-efficiency of LEMR, and includes an energy-efficient new dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism that uses the different channels available in the single transceiver device to enhance the throughput capability of the network. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMR-multichannel in terms of these performance metrics when compared with well-known protocols, such as LEMR, SMAC, TMAC and SCP-MAC.","","978-1-4244-4387-1","978-1-4244-4388-8","10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5305150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305150","Energy;Jitter;Latency;MAC;Multimedia;Network;Routing;Sensor;Wireless","Access protocols;Acoustic sensors;Data engineering;Delay;Energy efficiency;Jitter;Media Access Protocol;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","jitter;multimedia communication;transceivers;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","LEMR-multichannel;adaptive multichannel;multimedia application;network delay;network jitter;network throughput;real-time multimedia wireless sensor network;scalar sensor data;throughput capability;transceiver device","","1","","15","","","10-11 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We take advantage of information side-channels that are present in the TCP/IP network stack of modern Linux kernels to infer information about off-path routes. Compared to previous tools, ours does not require additional resources, machines, or require additional protocols beyond TCP. The only requirements are that one end host have an open port and be running a modern Linux kernel and that the other end host responds to unsolicited SYN-ACK packets with a RST packet. We evaluate our technique “in the wild” and compare our off-path estimates to on-path measurements. Our experiments show that our technique provides accurate, real-time estimates of off-path network latency. In over 80% of measurements our technique provides off-path round trip time measurements within 20% of the actual round trip time. We also discuss possible causes of errors that impact the accuracy of our measurements.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218538","","Extraterrestrial measurements;IP networks;Kernel;Linux;Loss measurement;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;telecommunication channels;transport protocols","Internet;Linux kernel;RST packet;TCP-IP network stack protocol;TCP-IP side channel;off-path round trip time measurement;round trip time network latency estimation;unsolicited SYN-ACK packet","","0","","22","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is, if a firewall prevents outside IP addresses from sending packets to an internal protected machine that is only accessible on the local network, our technique can still find the machine. We employ a novel TCP/IP side channel technique to achieve this. The technique uses side channels in “zombie” machines to learn information about the network from the perspective of a zombie. Unlike previous TCP/IP side channel techniques, our technique does not require a high packet rate and does not cause denial-of-service. We also make no assumptions about globally incrementing IPIDs, as do idle scans. This paper addresses two key questions about our technique: how many machines are there on the Internet that are hidden behind firewalls, and how common is ingress filtering that prevents our scan by not allowing spoofed IP packets into the network. We answer both of these questions, respectively, by finding 1,296 hidden machines and measuring that only 23.9% of our candidate zombie machines are on networks that perform ingress filtering.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218441","","IP networks;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Ports (Computers);Probes;Size measurement","IP networks;Internet;firewalls","IP addresses;IP identification;Internet measurement technique;TCP/IP side channel technique;firewalls;hidden machines;idle scans;original SYN;zombie machines","","0","","33","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, network devices, enterprise servers or personal computers are potential targets of these attacks. Current security solutions like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and virtual private networks (VPN) are centralized solutions which rely mostly on the analyze of inbound network connections. This approach notably forgets the effects of a rogue station, whose communications cannot be easily controlled unless the administrators establish a global authentication policy using methods like 802.1x to control all network communications among each device. To the best of our knowledge, a distributed and easily manageable solution for the global security of an enterprise network does not exist. In this paper, we present a new approach to deploy a distributed security solution where communication between each device can be control in a collaborative manner. Indeed, each device has its own security rules, who can be shared and improved through exchanges with others devices. With this new approach, called grid of security, a community of devices ensures that a device is trustworthy and that communications between devices progress in respect of the control of the system policies. To support this approach, we present a new communication model that helps structuring the distribution of security services among the devices. Like this, we can secure both ad-hoc, local-area or enterprise networks in a decentralized manner, preventing the risk of a security breach in the case of a failure.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318979","distributed communication;grid design;security architecture","Authentication;Collaboration;Communication system control;Communication system security;Control systems;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Microcomputers;Network servers;Virtual private networks","grid computing;middleware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","authentication policy;distributed security solution;firewalls;grid of security;intrusion detection systems;network security;virtual private networks","","1","","17","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the importance of reliable energy utility infrastructure is growing, various security countermeasures to protect power system from security threats have been suggested, whereas there were less consideration on security by design, from the bottom system modeling level. Thus, this paper first highlights the international security standard on network and system management (NSM) requirements suggested from International Electronical Committee (IEC). Then this paper proposes significance of security by design, especially the security object modeling as the most important factor in smart grid environment. In our approach, we propose a common NSM objects for IEC-61850 protocol based substation automation environment.

Very relevant communication concepts have been investigated such as RF radio communication in the terra hertz band or molecular communication based on transmitter molecules. Yet, one question has not been considered so far and that is nano communication security, i.e., will it be possible to protect such systems from manipulation by malicious parties? Our objective is to provide some first insights into the security challenges and to highlight some of the open research challenges in this field. The main observation is that especially for molecular communication existing security and cryptographic solutions might not be applicable. In this context, we coin the term biochemical cryptography that might lead to significant improvements in the field of molecular communication.

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of “self-driving” cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of “connected vehicles” (United States) or “cooperative ITS” (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting. We also raise awareness to generate discussion about these threats at this early stage in the development of vehicle automation systems.","1524-9050","","","10.1109/TITS.2014.2342271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899663","Automated vehicle;autonomous vehicle;cooperative automated vehicle;cyberattacks;security","Automation;Computer crime;Privacy;Safety;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","intelligent transportation systems;road safety;security of data","V2I/I2V;V2V;automation system safety;autonomous automated vehicles;connected vehicles;cooperative ITS;cooperative automated vehicle systems;cooperative automated vehicles;cyberattacks;intelligent transportation systems;self-driving cars;vehicle automation systems","","0","","48","","2014-09-16","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They are used for spamming, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information, and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for several reasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February 2011. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers. Its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure.

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we use the ns-2 network simulator to demonstrate the vulnerability of the MintRoute protocol to link quality attacks by a malicious node. We then propose a novel ""sequence number gap trick"" as a lightweight means to test for and detect the presence of a malicious attacker.

On the other hand, anticipatory reasoning-reacting systems (ARRS) were proposed as a high secure system with the ability to defend against malice anticipatorily, however, until now, there is no concrete implementation of ARRS for security, as well as no evidence showing the practical usefulness of anticipatory computing for security. As a step towards to ideal secure systems, we designed and implemented an ARRS for malice defense, which can adapt to different application by configuring different information source, anticipatory model, and anticipatory actions.

In this paper, a distributed double-loop Sagnac interferometer system based fiber optic sensor is designed and validated in field for detecting and locating intruders. First, the double-loop structure is improved by adding a certain length of transmission fiber in the start and end of each loop which enhances the linear relationship between amplitude and distance. Second, in order to enhance the SNR, a spectral subtraction pre-processing method is provided. Through the above methods, precise location of a disturbance is guaranteed. Results of field tests show that the SNR is greatly improved and the system could achieve spatial resolution of ±15m per kilometer.","","978-1-4799-4316-6","","10.1109/ICIEA.2014.6931215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6931215","distributed system;double-loop Sagnac interferometer;intrusion detection;spectral subtraction","Optical fiber sensors;Optical fibers;Optical interferometry;Sagnac interferometers;Vibrations","Sagnac interferometers;fibre optic sensors;optical fibre testing;safety systems","SNR;amplitude;communication cable protection;comprehensive applications;distance;distributed double-loop Sagnac interferometer system;distributed fiber-optic sensing;disturbance location;double-loop structure;fiber optic sensor;fiber optic technology;field tests;harsh environments;high-precision positioning;intruder detection;intruder locating;linear relationship;loop end;loop start;pipeline maintenance;security monitoring;spatial resolution;spectral subtraction preprocessing method;transmission fiber","","0","","18","","","9-11 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These open environments cause WSN to be more vulnerable to various wireless hackinglike spoofing jamming and broadcast attack. Securing a WSN from these attacks is a challenging task. Denial of Service (DoS) attack is one of the major security attacks in WSN. Jamming a single or cluster of nodes is a type of DoS attack on WSN. In this paper, a novel approach in detecting the physical layer DoS style jamming attack is proposed and analyzed. Here, we propose a method called physical layer jamming identification. This method is based on residual energy where few nodes are marked as monitor nodes. These nodes monitor the jamming attack by checking the Receiver Signal Strength Indicator and packet delivery ratio values of other nodes. It improves system performance and increases packet deliver ratio.","","978-1-4673-2922-4","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449882","Denial of service attack;Jamming attack;Wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;Jamming;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;jamming;radio receivers;wireless sensor networks","DoS style jamming attack detection;WSN;broadcast attack;catalyst;computer networks;denial of service attack;environmental monitoring;military surveillance;open environments;outdoor applications;packet delivery ratio values;physical layer jamming identification;receiver signal strength indicator;residual energy;wireless hackinglike spoofing jamming;wireless sensor network","","0","","16","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security model in wired networks is not suited for WSNs because of their energy constraints. In this paper, a traffic prediction model based on gene expression programming (GEP-ADS) is proposed, to predict the time series of normal traffic. Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS. The simulation results show that our ADS is able to achieve high detection accuracy with a low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283101","","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Gene expression;Hidden Markov models;Mathematics;Predictive models;Programming profession;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","genetic algorithms;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;time series;wireless sensor networks","GEP-ADS algorithm;GEP-based lightweight anomaly detection scheme;WSN trust;energy constraint;energy consumption;gene expression programming;intrusion detection scheme;routing attack;security model;simulation result;time series method;traffic prediction model;wired network;wireless sensor network reliability","","0","","16","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents methods for isolating the malicious traffic by using a honeypot system and analyzing it in order to automatically generate attack signatures for the Snort intrusion detection/prevention system. The honeypot is deployed as a virtual machine and its job is to log as much information as it can about the attacks. Then, using a protected machine, the logs are collected remotely, through a safe connection, for analysis. The challenge is to mitigate the risk we are exposed to and at the same time search for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4673-6140-8","","10.1109/CSCS.2013.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6569317","honeypot;intrusion detec- tion/prevention system;zero-day attacks","Dictionaries;IP networks;Operating systems;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Security;Virtual machining","computer network security;invasive software;virtual machines","Snort intrusion detection system;Snort intrusion prevention system;computer network;honeypot system;information security domain;malware;security vulnerability;virtual machine;zero-day attack analysis;zero-day attack detection","","2","","11","","","29-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CPINDEX installs appropriate cyber-side instrumentation probes on individual host systems to dynamically capture and profile low-level system activities such as interprocess communications among operating system assets. CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system. Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state. The results of our experiments with actual attacks against a real-world power control network shows that CPINDEX, within few seconds, can efficiently compute the numerical indices during the attack that indicate the progressing malicious attack correctly.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2372315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979242","Cyber-physical security metrics;cyber-physical systems;intrusion detection systems;situational awareness","Generators;Indexes;Power measurement;Security;Smart grids","Bayes methods;graph theory;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system security;risk management;stochastic processes","CPIndex;cyber-physical critical infrastructures;cyber-physical security indices;cyber-physical vulnerability assessment;cyber-side instrumentation probes;graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm;interprocess communications;numerical indices;operating system assets;power network configuration;power operators;power-grid Infrastructures;power-grid control networks;security assessment techniques;security-oriented stochastic risk management technique;stochastic Bayesian network models","","1","","20","","2014-12-08","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this model, we bound the competitive ratio between a reactive defense algorithm (which is inspired by online learning theory) and the best fixed proactive defense.

One way to keep the quiescent current low is to replace conventional electronic systems like an intrusion detection system by an energy autonomous one. The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient. Power consumption of the proposed wireless sensor network is computed and compared with other wireless networks employing different types of ALOHA MAC layer protocols for handling sporadic traffic without significant control overhead.","","978-1-4673-1590-6","978-1-4673-1589-0","10.1109/SSD.2012.6198098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198098","Wireless sensor networks;automotive;energy autonomous","Base stations;Glass;Media Access Protocol;Power demand;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;automotive electronics;energy conservation;energy harvesting;mobile radio;power consumption;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","ALOHA;ASYMOF;MAC layer protocol;automobile safety system;built-in safety feature;electronic system;energy autonomous microsystems with mechanical energy harvester for mobile;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;network traffic handling;parking garage;power consumption;wireless energy autonomous sensor network","","0","","8","","","20-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, the network processor has become a promising solution for network devices due to its computation capability and programming flexibility. However, developing the network applications on network processors is not easy. How to efficiently program multiple processing elements and utilize various memory modules as well as the hardware resources on network processors are always challenges. In this paper, we investigate several optimization issues and programming techniques that should be considered by the developers to achieve higher packet processing rate on network processors. We use an existing packet classification scheme called hierarchical binary prefix search (HBPS) as the benchmark to test and evaluate these optimization techniques. The experiments conducted on Intel IXP2400 network processor show that the overall performance of HBPS can be improved about 42% while these techniques are adopted.","","978-1-4244-6969-7","978-1-4244-6970-3","10.1109/HPSR.2010.5580281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580281","Intel IXP2400;network processor;packet classification","","Internet;multi-threading;optimisation;packet switching","Intel IXP2400 network processor;Internet;hardware resource;hierarchical binary prefix search;memory module;multithreaded network processor;optimization technique;optimized packet processing;packet classification scheme;program multiple processing","","1","","13","","","13-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current software-based solutions, however, have difficulties dealing with a great number of flows in today's high-speed networks. This paper proposes RocketTC, a scalable FPGA-based architecture, to accelerate traffic classification while maintaining high accuracy. It combines two significant elements: (1) an efficient flow management scheme using on-chip BRAMs for storing the flow table, and (2) a parallel and pipelined classification engine array with partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR) on FPGA. We have implemented and evaluated RocketTC on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA based platform. Our results show a sustained throughput of over 20 Gbps for minimum packet size of 40 bytes, and high accuracy above 97% for classifying nearly a hundred popular applications. Additionally, it is easy for RocketTC to update more application types.","","978-1-4673-0008-7","978-1-4673-0723-9","10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6167454","","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Payloads;Pipelines;Throughput","computer architecture;field programmable gate arrays;microprocessor chips;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","FPGA-based architecture;RocketTC;Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA based platform;flow management scheme;flow table;high throughput traffic classification architecture;high-speed networks;network management;network security;on-chip BRAMs;parallel classification engine array;partial dynamic reconfiguration;pipelined classification engine array;software-based solutions;traffic classification acceleration;traffic engineering","","0","","18","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2363844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951478","Energy management;plug and play (PnP);reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid;team formation","Australia;Availability;Nickel;Renewable energy sources;Smart grids;Standards;Substations","distribution networks;energy management systems;environmental factors;multi-agent systems;smart power grids;substations","DVF;IEEE 34-bus test feeder;MAS;carbon based generation;distributed value function;distribution networks;energy balance;energy management;environmental factors;installation objectives;multiagent system;power storage systems;renewable energy resources;smart grid;supply-and-demand balance;zone substation","","0","","43","","2014-11-10","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In our paper, top-ten classification algorithms namely J48, BayesNet, Logistic, SGD, IBK, JRip, PART, Random Forest, Random Tree and REPTree were selected after experimenting with more than twenty most widely used classification algorithms. The comparison of these top-ten classification algorithms is presented in this paper based upon their performance metrics to find out the best suitable algorithm available.

Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200273","Anomaly detection;least squares;online updating;oversampling;principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Data models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Memory management;Principal component analysis","","","","4","","26","","2012-05-15","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
