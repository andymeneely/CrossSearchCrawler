Nonetheless, the effectiveness of ITM systems largely depends on the confidentiality of their monitor locations. In this paper, we investigate localization attacks aiming to identify ITM monitor location and propose the formal model of such attacks using communication channel theory. We also develop novel techniques that significantly increases the accuracy, efficiency, and secrecy of ITM localization attacks. Specifically, we introduce (i) a frequency-based modulation technique to effectively reduce the interference from the background traffic and achieve a high attack accuracy, (ii) both time and space hopping techniques to randomize signal pattern and make the attack hard to detect by the defender, and (iii) Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) based techniques to increase the attack efficiency of identifying multiple monitors simultaneously. We derive closed formulae for the performance analysis of our proposed techniques and conduct extensive simulations. Our data validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that the adversary can identify ITM monitors accurately, efficiently, and secretly.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654820","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654820","","Accuracy;Frequency modulation;Internet;MIMO;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","Internet;MIMO communication;invasive software;modulation;telecommunication traffic","ITM localization attack secrecy;ITM monitor location;ITM systems;Internet threat monitoring;MIMO based techniques;background traffic;communication channel theory;effective localization attacks;frequency-based modulation technique;interference;malware propagation;multiple input multiple output;randomize signal pattern;space hopping techniques;time hopping techniques","","0","","13","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Single Sign-On is a property of access control in information security which focuses on authentication mechanism. It can be performed across federated domains and provides a single entry point for the user that can login only once and become capable of accessing to disparate protected resources in different locations. The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) can be used invisibly in background of system and apply as the standard for providing Single Sign-On mechanism by exchanging identity information to different security domains regardless of the specific authentication protocol which is used for identities in that domain.

"Robust Correlation of Encrypted Attack Traffic through Stepping Stones by Flow Watermarking","Xinyuan Wang; Reeves, D.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on","20110314","2011","8","3","434","449","Network-based intruders seldom attack their victims directly from their own computer. Often, they stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones” in order to conceal their identity and origin. To identify the source of the attack behind the stepping stone(s), it is necessary to correlate the incoming and outgoing flows or connections of a stepping stone. To resist attempts at correlation, the attacker may encrypt or otherwise manipulate the connection traffic. Timing-based correlation approaches have been shown to be quite effective in correlating encrypted connections. However, timing-based correlation approaches are subject to timing perturbations that may be deliberately introduced by the attacker at stepping stones. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based-correlation scheme that is designed specifically to be robust against timing perturbations. Unlike most previous timing-based correlation approaches, our watermark-based approach is “active” in that it embeds a unique watermark into the encrypted flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. The unique watermark that is embedded in the encrypted flow gives us a number of advantages over passive timing-based correlation in resisting timing perturbations by the attacker. In contrast to the existing passive correlation approaches, our active watermark-based correlation does not make any limiting assumptions about the distribution or random process of the original interpacket timing of the packet flow. In theory, our watermark-based correlation can achieve arbitrarily close to 100 percent correlation true positive rate (TPR), and arbitrarily close to 0 percent false positive rate (FPR) at the same time for sufficiently long flows, despite arbitrarily large (but bounded) timing perturbations of any distribution by the attacker. Our paper is the first that identifies 1) accurate quantitative tradeoffs between the achievable correlation effectiveness - nd the defining characteristics of the timing perturbation; and 2) a provable upper bound on the number of packets needed to achieve a desired correlation effectiveness, given the amount of timing perturbation. Experimental results show that our active watermark-based correlation performs better and requires fewer packets than existing, passive timing-based correlation methods in the presence of random timing perturbations.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551157","Network-level security and protection;correlation;intrusion tracing;stepping stone.","Correlation;Cryptography;Decoding;Delay;Robustness;Watermarking","cryptography;random processes;watermarking","encrypted attack traffic;false positive rate;flow watermarking;network based intruder;random timing perturbation;stepping stones;true positive rate;watermark based correlation scheme","","1","","37","","2010-08-19","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

And we focus on dropping-packet attacks which are the sore point in wireless sensor networks. We claim that of course our model is not only a detective model but also a correctional model. because first we corner malicious nodes and then we give them incentives to mend their ways and try to behave in favor of other nodes in WSN. We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant. And even we try to use the sporadic well-mannered cooperative behavior of the malicious node in favor of improving overall throughput of our WSN. Based on rationality we believe that even malicious nodes before being known as extreme notorious nodes, they try to impersonate their true type and show a little collaborative behavior.","0840-7789","978-1-4244-5376-4","978-1-4244-5377-1","10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575157","Nash equilibrium;Subgame perfect equilibrium;WSN — Intrusion detection system (IDS);attack-resistant mechanism;repeated game","Games;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nash equilibrium;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-defense problem;cooperative Nash equilibrium;dropping-packet attacks;game-theoretical model;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","1","","23","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most cases are trapped in the system due to a huge backlog of cases, excessive litigation in urban areas, corruption by the court staff and lack of proper monitoring of the functioning of courts. Efficient supervision and monitoring of courts can help in resolving some of the key problems in the system. We present preliminary results from a novel case record-keeping, management and monitoring solution that is able to meet several key performance goals of the National Judicial Policy. The overall aim of the work is to facilitate the work of the monitoring judges by helping them find the proverbial needle in the haystack and not get deluged by the volume of data routinely produced by the typical case-management systems. In this paper, we explore the application of intrusion detection techniques, such as the statistical anomaly detection schemes, to case management systems and present the results from our extensive case studies. Our proposed system, now in pilot, shows high accuracy in flagging anomalous cases, reduces the overall volume of information generated by the system and can help target several of the key reasons behind case pendency while bringing much needed transparency to the overall case-flow.","","","","10.1109/HICSS.2014.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758839","Judiciary;anomaly detection;monitoring","Auditory system;Delays;Engines;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optical character recognition software","law administration;security of data","Pakistan;case management systems;case record-keeping;case-management systems;intrusion detection techniques;judicial process delay;litigation;national judicial policy;remote court monitoring;statistical anomaly detection schemes","","0","","19","","","6-9 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These targeted attacks use special-crafted malware and infrequent activity to avoid detection, so that hackers can retain control over target systems unnoticed for long periods of time. In order to detect these stealthy activities, a large-volume of traffic data generated in a period of time has to be analyzed. We proposed a scalable solution, Ctracer to detect stealthy command and control channel in a large-volume of traffic data. APT uses multiple command and control (C&C) channel and change them frequently to avoid detection, but there are common signatures in those C&C sessions. By identifying common network signature, Ctracer is able to group the C&C sessions. Therefore, we can detect an APT and all the C&C session used in an APT attack. The Ctracer is evaluated in a large enterprise for four months, twenty C&C servers, three APT attacks are reported. After investigated by the enterprise's Security Operations Center (SOC), the forensic report shows that there is specific enterprise targeted APT cases and not ever discovered for over 120 days.","","978-1-4673-7277-0","","10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207270","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT);Command and Control (C&amp;C);mapreduce;networking logs","Command and control systems;Computers;Electronic mail;Internet;Itemsets;Malware;Servers","business data processing;computer crime;digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software","APT attack;C&C channel;C&C sessions;Ctracer;SOC;Security Operations Center;advanced persistent threat;enterprise log data;forensic report;hackers;malware;network signature;scalable framework;stealthy activities detection;stealthy command and control channel detection;targeted attacks;traffic data","","0","","25","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets are groups of compromised computers controlled by a botmaster through a command and control (C&C) channel. They are noted as one of the foremost security threat causing large scale attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Spam, mass identity theft and click fraud. Various approaches are used to detect botnets and they range from network to host level detection. To enhance the detection rate, a correlation based model was proposed that combines both host and network level information. Such a model is valid in a network made of trusted hosts. The emergence of smartphones with the capability of mobility and being hosts in different networks, open the door of having untrusted hosts that can reveal fake information. As a solution, we propose a trust-based model that uses cooperative game theory to cluster trusted hosts. The trust is built using the reputation value and it is computed using the hosts' marginal contribution which is derived from Shapley value. Simulation results show that our model improves the detection score compared to the traditional correlation model. Where in one of the simulated scenarios we are able to detect a benign cluster of hosts faster than the traditional correlation model.","","978-1-4673-5306-9","","10.1109/ICCITechnology.2013.6579517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6579517","Botnet;botnet detection system;cooperative game theory;correlation;game theory","Computational modeling;Correlation;Data models;Game theory;Games;Ports (Computers);Security","command and control systems;correlation methods;game theory;invasive software;smart phones;unsolicited e-mail","DDoS;Shapley value;botnet detection;click fraud;command and control channel;cooperative game theoretical correlation based model;distributed denial of service;host level detection;mass identity theft;smartphones;spam;trusted hosts","","0","","21","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is found that the received signals are the same as the transmitted signal, only with a time delay and attenuation in amplitude. When there is an obstacle between the cables, the received signals regularly change with the location of the obstacle. Based on the analysis, a location detection method which is valuable to the design of intrusion detection system is discussed.","","978-1-4673-1799-3","","10.1109/ISAPE.2012.6408845","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408845","coupling characteristics;leaky coaxial cables;obstacle detection;superposition principle","Arrays;Attenuation;Bandwidth;Coaxial cables;Couplings;Delay effects;Power cables","coaxial cables;coaxial waveguides;delays;signal detection;telecommunication security;transceivers","LCX;amplitude attenuation;coupling characteristics;intrusion detection system;leaky coaxial cables;leaky waveguide structures;location detection method;received signal analysis;receiving cable;superposition principle;time delay;transceiver;transverse slot analysis","","0","","8","","","22-26 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, an important property of agents: learning is not used. The concept of learning in existing IDSs used in general to learn the normal behavior of the system to secure. For this, normal profiles are built in a dedicated training phase, these profiles are then compared with the current activity. Thus, the IDS does not have the ability to detect new attacks. We propose in this paper, a new architecture based intrusion MAS adding a learning feature abnormal behaviors that correspond to new attack patterns detection. Thanks to this feature to update the knowledge base of attacks take place when a new plan of attack is discovered. To learn a new attack, the architecture must detect at first and then update the basic attack patterns. For the detection step, the detection approach adopted is based on the technique of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). Thus, the proposed architecture is based on a hierarchical and distributed strategy where features are structured and separated into layers.","","978-1-4799-5586-2","","10.1109/JNS4.2014.6850123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6850123","Agent;Case-Based Reasoning;Intrusion Detection;Keys Words;Learning;Multi-Agent System;Network;Plan of Attack;Security","Cognition;Computer architecture;Databases;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","case-based reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;security of data","CBR;IDS;MAS;attack patterns detection;case-based reasoning;communication characteristic;cooperation characteristic;delegation characteristic;intelligent architecture;intrusion detection;learning concept;learning feature;multi-agent systems","","1","","21","","","12-13 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the vast number of triggered intrusion alerts, identifying those to prioritise is highly challenging. Alert correlation and prioritisation are both viable analytical methods which are commonly used to understand and prioritise alerts. However, to the author's knowledge, very few dynamic prioritisation metrics exist. In this paper, a new prioritisation metric - OutMet, which is based on measuring the degree to which an alert belongs to anomalous behaviour is proposed. OutMet combines alert correlation and prioritisation analysis. We illustrate the effectiveness of OutMet by testing its ability to prioritise alerts generated from a 2012 red-team cyber-range experiment that was carried out as part of the BT Saturn programme. In one of the scenarios, OutMet significantly reduced the false-positives by 99.3%.","","978-1-4799-3778-3","","10.1109/LCN.2014.6925787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6925787","Alert Correlation;Attack Scenario;Graph Mining;IDS Logs;Intrusion Alert Analysis;Intrusion Detection;Pattern Detection","Cities and towns;Complexity theory;Context;Correlation;Educational institutions;IP networks;Measurement","computer network security;correlation methods;graph theory","BT Saturn programme;IDS;OutMet;alert correlation and prioritisation analysis;correlation analysis;dynamic prioritisation metrics;intrusion alerts;intrusion detection system;medium sized network;outlier analysis;red-team cyber-range experiment","","0","","33","","","8-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the smartphones are becoming widespread, it's also becoming a popular target for security threats and attack. Since smartphones use the same software architecture as in PCs, they are vulnerable to be exposed to similar threats such as in PCs. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS). Major limitations of smartphone technology are its processing power and its scarce energy source since smartphones rely on battery usage. The smartphones have less storage and computational power to put into effect highly complex algorithms for intrusion detection and implementing signature based attack detection. Now in this paper, we propose a cloud based Intrusion Detection System for smartphones to overcome the issues of smartphone resource constraints and to detect any misbehavior or anomalous activity effectively.","","978-1-4799-6817-6","","10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7193252","Intrusion Detection System;SNORT;Signature Database;Smartphone","Intrusion detection;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Servers;Smart phones","cloud computing;digital signatures;invasive software;smart phones;telecommunication security","Internet browse;cloud based intrusion detection architecture;malware;message exchange;online shopping;signature based security attack detection;smartphone","","0","","21","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IDN is used to capture packets, de-multiplex packets, detect local intrusion and infer intrusion. The IDC is installed in an administration workstation for communicating and managing IDNs, it can also do the intrusion detection and intrusion inferring. The RA consists of several snoop functions for information gathering. After an attack behavior is detected, the RA may launch some kinds of information gathering functions to the attacker, so that the proposed NIDS-SA has the active snoop ability. Furthermore, NIDS-SA includes the functions of the pattern matching and statistical inference. To ensure the secure communication ability between IDC and IDNs, the cryptography-based mechanisms are applied in the design phase of the proposed NIDS-SA.

Our research focused on mining the most useful network features for attack detection. In this paper, we proposed a new hybrid feature selection algorithm based on Chi-Square and enhanced C4.5 algorithm to build lightweight network intrusion detection system. The attributes selection technique used in the preprocessing phase to emphasize the most relevant attributes, allow making model of classification simpler and easy to understand.

Such paradigm shift enables to build more manageable, agile and smarter data communication infrastructures. Despite the interest it is deserving on a multitude of physical and virtualized infrastructures, currently there are no systematic approaches of characterizing and comparing alternative SDN-based solutions regarding their resilience -- a characteristic of utmost importance on such critical environments. In this paper we present a tentative path to bridge this gap, by proposing a research agenda to advance resilience benchmarks for SDNs.

For researchers to address these shortcomings, they need methods for evaluating HICHPs.

NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios. Then a new approach, called Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK), based on NACK and Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is proposed. It is shown that the proposed acknowledgement method outperforms NACK with much less packet overhead, by comparing the results of simulations in Network Simulator v-2.35 (NS-2).","0840-7789","978-1-4799-5827-6","","10.1109/CCECE.2015.7129395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129395","Internal Attacker;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Negative/Selective-Acknowledgement","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Nickel;Protocols;Routing","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;Network Simulator v-2.35;SACK;SNACK method;black hole;independent devices;intrusion detection system;lightweight security monitoring;mobile ad-hoc network;packet delivery;selective acknowledgement;selective-negative acknowledgement algorithm;wormhole","","0","","20","","","3-6 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on information entropy, risk coefficient was defined to describe the whole condition of network security. To forecast the change of risk coefficient, a model was set up according to grey theory. Using a few data, the model can forecast risk coefficient accurately. Simulation and experiments were completed by MATLAB and in LAN. The experiments in LAN prove that information entropy can reflect anomaly traffic caused by DDoS attacks and Internet worms in time and effectively. The simulation by MATLAB shows that by GM(1,1) information entropy and risk coefficient can be forecasted accurately.

Conventional network security mechanisms are incompetent to overcome these challenges, since they are built on a static network configuration that facilitates attackers in finding the weaknesses of a network. In this article, we conceive a novel conceptual network security mechanism, the evolving defense mechanism (EDM), to resolve current and future security problems. EDM is based on a bio-inspired idea of network configuration variations. According to the security requirements of the system, the user, and the network security state, EDM selects an efficient network configuration variation strategy to prevent corresponding security threats. Combined with SDN implementation, EDM resolves security problems from a new angle and is capable of evolving with new network security technology. We sketch a way to implement EDM and present its reference framework, which serves as an ecosystem and coexisting environment for various kinds of network configuration variations. The proposed mechanism avoids the deficiency of conventional mechanisms and has potential to cope with emerging security threats.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2015.7081074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081074","","Biological systems;Communication networks;Ecosystmes;IP networks;Network security;Telecommunication network management","Internet;computer network security;software defined networking","EDM;Internet;SDN;bio-inspired idea;coexisting environment;ecosystem;evolving defense mechanism;future network security;network configuration variation strategy;network technology;security threat prevention","","0","","","","","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is why, so far, they are only used in the field of network intrusion detection. In this paper, we present our results concerning a concurrent host memory sampling mechanism based on direct memory access (DMA) and demonstrate that it is possible to de-couple GPU kernel execution, thereby providing temporary isolation from the host and allowing data sampling actions to be taken without interruption.

This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen.

Compared with other ad-hoc networks, VANETs are particularly challenging due to the part of the vehicles' high rate of mobility and the numerous signal-weakening barrier, such as buildings, in their environments. Due to their enormous potential, VANET have gained an increasing attention in both industry and academia.

As engineering educators whose academic focus is information assurance and cyber security, we believe students in cyber security need the same type of access to hands on opportunities as their counter parts in hardware design or circuit design. Students should be able to configure and run their own networks, as well as explore the vulnerabilities, exploits, and remediatios needed in a cyber security professional's tool kit. Further, they need exposure to working in the complexity of the Internet. While some might argue that simulation software could be a solution, it often lacks realism. In this paper we show how our institution goes beyond the providing the standard, formalized laboratory activities for our cyber security students by developing a unique, highly configurable testbed called Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment (ISEAGE - pronounced “ice age”) that allows us to imitate the Internet. ISEAGE provides a controlled environment that allows real attacks to be played out against the students' networks and demonstrates to them real world security concepts.

This is due to the inherent benefits of virtualization including fault tolerance through checkpoint/restart (C/R) mechanisms. Because clouds are the abstraction of large data enters and large data enters have a higher potential for failure, it is imperative that a C/R mechanism for such an environment provide minimal latency as well as a small checkpoint file size. Recently, there has been much research into C/R with respect to virtual machines (VM) providing excellent solutions to reduce either checkpoint latency or checkpoint file size. However, these approaches do not provide both. This paper presents a method of check pointing VMs by utilizing virtual machine introspection (VMI). Through the usage of VMI, we are able to determine which pages of memory within the guest are used or free and are better able to reduce the amount of pages written to disk during a checkpoint. We have validated this work by using various benchmarks to measure the latency along with the checkpoint size. With respect to checkpoint file size, our approach results in file sizes within 24% or less of the actual used memory within the guest. Additionally, the checkpoint latency of our approach is up to 52% faster than KVM's default method.","","","","10.1109/CCGrid.2014.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846477","Checkpointing;Cloud;Virtualization","Checkpointing;Kernel;Linux;Memory management;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","checkpointing;cloud computing;fault tolerance;virtual machines;virtualisation","C/R mechanisms;VMI;checkpoint/restart mechanisms;cloud computing environments;fault tolerance;system-level virtualization;virtual machine introspection","","0","","30","","","26-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol to deliver packets to the destination in the presence of multiple persistent adversaries that deploy different types of simple to extended attacks.","","978-1-4577-0025-5","","10.1109/CTS.2011.5898964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898964","WSN security;directional antennas;recovery;secure routing","Computer crime;Directional antennas;Protocols;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","computer network reliability;computer network security;directive antennas;safety-critical software;wireless sensor networks","decision-making;directional antennas;mission-critical areas;network availability;network reliability;ns-2;persistent adversaries;security;wireless sensor networks","","2","","21","","","8-11 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional protection mechanisms do not fit into the highly dynamic, open and large-scale settings of VoIP infrastructures, and may significantly impact on the performance of such a critical service. We propose in this paper a runtime risk management strategy based on anomaly detection techniques for continuously adapting the VoIP service exposure. This solution relies on support vector machines (SVM) and exploits dynamic security safeguards to reduce risks in a progressive manner. We describe how SVM parameters can be integrated into a runtime risk model, and show how this framework can be deployed into an Asterisk VoIP server. We evaluate the benefits and limits of our solution through a prototype and an extensive set of experimental results.","","978-1-4244-8910-7","978-1-4244-8908-4","10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5691338","","Mathematical model;Monitoring;Risk management;Runtime;Security;Support vector machines;Training","Internet telephony;risk management;support vector machines","VoIP infrastructures;anomaly detection techniques;multiple security threats;risk management;runtime risk management strategy;support vector machines;telephony over IP","","1","","19","","","25-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the information extracted from network flows a model of normal user behavior is discovered with the help of several clustering techniques. This model is then used to detect anomalies within recent time intervals. Since this approach is based on normal user behavior, it can potentially detect zero-day intrusions. Moreover, such a flow-based intrusion detection approach can be used in high speeds since it is based on information in packet headers, and, therefore, has to handle a considerably lesser amount of data. The proposed framework is tested on the data obtained with the help of a realistic cyber environment (RGCE) that enables one to construct real attack vectors. The simulations show that the proposed method results in a higher accuracy rate when compared to other intrusion detection techniques.","","","","10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266510","","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Histograms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Training","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","RGCE;anomalous network flows;intrusion detection approach;normal user behavior;online detection;packet headers;realistic cyber environment;soft clustering;traffic flows;zero-day intrusions","","","","","","","27-29 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Network intrusion prevention by configuring ACLs on the routers, based on snort IDS alerts","Naveed, M.; un Nihar, S.; Inayatullah Babar, M.","","Emerging Technologies (ICET), 2010 6th International Conference on","20101115","2010","","","234","239","Intrusion prevention is one of the fundamental requirements for a network to be secure. Investing on intrusion prevention forbade its use for securing many networks. This study proposes a very basic way to prevent intrusions without any additional cost. Snort is a free open source IDS, which we have integrated with a Cisco router to prevent intrusions. Cisco routers are very common in today's networks. Other routers like Juniper, or even simple ADSL or SOHO routers can be used but with minor changes for the router specific configuration. As ADSL is very common nowadays, ADSL routers are present everywhere and they can easily replace the Cisco router used in this study and provide intrusion prevention capabilities for homes and businesses which otherwise are not able to afford it. Router and computer (to be used as a sensor) are fundamental components of every major network, so, the proposed system does not need any additional hardware. Snort is used as an IDS and alerts are logged to a database from where they are read and router Access Control List (ACL) rules are generated based on Snort intrusion alerts and then these ACL rules are configured on the router to block the potential intrusions. Method for removing ACL rules is also proposed, which may be required under some circumstances. In a fine tuned Snort IDS, false alarms will be minimum and most of the alerts will indicate intrusions. Hence, proposed system can work best to prevent intrusions with a fine tuned Snort IDS.","","978-1-4244-8057-9","","10.1109/ICET.2010.5638482","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5638482","ACL Generation;Access Control List (ACL);Intrusion Prevention;Router;Router Configuration;Snort","Databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Protocols","computer network security;telecommunication network routing","ACL rules;ADSL routers;SOHO routers;cisco router;free open source IDS;intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention;potential intrusions;router access control list rules;snort IDS alerts;snort intrusion alerts","","0","","21","","","18-19 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To cope with the attacks, a large variety of intrusion detection techniques such as authentication, authorization, cryptographic protocols and key management schemes have been developed. Clustering methods allow fast connection, better routing and topology management of mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). This paper, we have introduced new mechanism called Energy Efficiency and Secure Communication Protocol (EESCP) is to divide the MANET into a set of 2-hop clusters where each node belongs to at least one cluster. The nodes in each cluster elect a leader node (cluster head) to serve as the IDS for the entire cluster. To balance the resource consumption weight based leader election model is used, which elected an optimal collection of leaders to minimize the overall resource consumption and obtaining secure communication using diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.","","978-1-4673-1037-6","","10.1109/ICPRIME.2012.6208348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208348","EESCP;Mobile adhoc networs;leader election;security","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Energy states;Lead;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","2-hop clusters;EESCP;MANET;clustering methods;cryptographic protocols;diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol;energy efficiency and secure communication protocol;intrusion detection techniques;key management schemes;leader node;mobile ad hoc networks;optimal collection;resource consumption weight based leader election model;routing management;secure communication;security attacks;topology management","","2","","14","","","21-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
