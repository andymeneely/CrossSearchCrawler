At present, a major concern in cloud adoption is towards its security and privacy. Security and privacy issues are of great concern to cloud service providers who are actually hosting the services. In most cases, the provider must guarantee that their infrastructure is secure and clients' data and applications are safe, by implementing security policies and mechanisms. The security issues are organized into several general categories: trust, identity management, software isolation, data protection, availability reliability, ownership, data backup, data portability and conversion, multi platform support and intellectual property.

Intrusion Detection is a major component in computer security systems that can be classified as Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which protects a certain host or system and Network-based Intrusion detection system (NIDS), which protects a network of hosts and systems. This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module. We have tested the system in a real environment where it has shown good capability in detecting attacks. In addition, the system has been tested using DARPA 1998 dataset with 100% recognition rate. In fact, our system can recognize attacks in a constant time.","","978-1-4799-3022-7","","10.1109/IACS.2014.6841978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841978","Host sweep;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network probe attack;Port scan;TDNN neural network","IP networks;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols","computer network security;neural nets;pattern classification","HIDS;NIDS;TDNN neural network structure;alert module;attack behavior classification;computer security systems;host sweep attacks;host-based intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection system;network probe attacks;packet capture engine;pattern classification;pattern recognition;port scan attacks;preprocessor;reconnaissance attacks;unauthorized accesses","","0","","26","","","1-3 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In modern integrated systems, there are four potential modes of attack available to an adversary: 1 physical only attack, 2 cyber only attack, 3 physical-enabled cyber attack, 4 cyber-enabled physical attack. Blended attacks involve an adversary working in one domain to reduce system effectiveness in another domain. This enables the attacker to penetrate further into the overall layered defenses. Existing vulnerability assessment (VA) processes and software tools which predict facility vulnerabilities typically evaluate the physical and cyber domains separately. Vulnerabilities which result from the integration of cyber-physical control systems are not well characterized and are often overlooked by existing assessment approaches. In this paper, we modified modification of the timely detection methodology, used for decades in physical security VAs, to include cyber components. The Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool (PACRAT) prototype illustrates an integrated vulnerability assessment that includes cyber-physical interdependencies. Information about facility layout, network topology, and emplaced safeguards is used to evaluate how well suited a facility is to detect, delay, and respond to attacks, to identify the pathways most vulnerable to attack, and to evaluate how often safeguards are compromised for a given threat or adversary type. We have tested the PACRAT prototype on critical infrastructure facilities and the results are promising. Future work includes extending the model to prescribe the recommended security improvements via an automated cost-benefit analysis.","","978-1-4673-4894-2","978-1-4673-4895-9","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497883","Modeling;Power Industry;Risk analysis;Security;Simulation","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer security;Delays;Organizations;Software tools","cost-benefit analysis;critical infrastructures;risk analysis;security of data","PACRAT;Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool;attack delay;attack detection;attack response;automated cost-benefit analysis;blended attack;critical asset security;critical infrastructure facility;cyber components;cyber only attack;cyber-enabled physical attack;cyber-physical control system;cyber-physical interdependency;cyber-physical security vulnerability assessment integration;emplaced safeguard;facility layout;facility vulnerability prediction;high value asset security;layered defense;network topology;physical only attack;physical-enabled cyber attack;security improvement;software tool;system effectiveness reduction","","0","","5","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a kernel level authentication prototype to verify the originality of each suspicious process during runtime. The verification and authentication tasks are performed well in advance before each suspicious process getting the kernel service. We designed, implemented, and assessed the prototype in Windows.

However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern.

Nevertheless, owing to the inter-worked infrastructure, a malicious security threat in such a heterogeneous network is no more confined to its originating network domain, but can easily be propagated to other access networks. To address these security concerns, this paper proposes a biologically inspired security framework that governs the cooperation among network entities to identify security attacks, to perform security updates, and to inhibit attacks propagation in the heterogeneous network. The proposed framework incorporates two principal security components, in the form of anomaly detection framework and security control framework. Several plausible principles from two fields of biology, in particular the human immune system (HIS) and epidemiology have been adopted into the proposed security framework. Performance evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed biologically inspired security framework in detecting malicious anomalies such as denial-of-service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and worms, as well as restricting their propagations in the heterogeneous network.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2010.1012.0360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5668982","Heterogeneous network security;biologically inspired security;danger theory;epidemiology;human immune system","Biological system modeling;Computer crime;Spectral analysis","complex networks;computer network security;invasive software;protocols","Internet protocol;biologically inspired anomaly detection;complex heterogeneous networks;denial-of-service;distributed DoS;future generation networks;human immune system;security control frameworks;worms","","4","","35","","","December 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our model employs feature selection so that the binary classifier for each type of attack can be more accurate, which improves the detection of attacks that occur less frequently in the training data. Based on the accurate binary classifiers, our model applies a new ensemble approach which aggregates each binary classifierpsilas decisions for the same input and decides which class is most suitable for a given input. During this process, the potential bias of certain binary classifier could be alleviated by other binary classifierspsila decision.

Sometimes, complainants are often bewildered and confused because it is almost certain that the prime suspects will be absolved in courts of law. These are tragic developments to computer security experts, corporate and private organizations that leverage on the usage of the Internet facilities to boost service delivery, business activities and profitability. Thus, this paper presents non-statistical metrics that adopt Serialization Modelling Method (S2M) to improve interpretations of intrusion logs.

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates. In this paper, we will outline the security concerns that misbehaviour poses in terms of both individual components and the SoS as a whole.

In recent years, Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology provides new solutions in the field of complex pattern identifications and real-time data processing, which can be used to improve the performance of traditional IDS in IoT environments. IDS integrated with CEP can be used to deal with patterns among events and process large volumes of messages with low latency.

By separating control and data planes, SDN enables the programming of the control plane and the dynamic reconfiguration of the data plane thus making it possible to automatize some tasks. SDN makes it possible to dynamically reconfigure a network as a response to a security event. This work studies the advantages and disadvantages of the platform for programming a network to react to security events. The number of security events that may happen in a network is considerable, therefore, we defined an architecture that may be used in different cases and implemented it to evaluate the behavior for two types of events: DoS attacks and intrusions. The platform offers several tools for programming and testing, but they are still in development. In fact, we found a problem with one tool and some inconveniences with others which we reported to the development team.

However, clustering analyses are insufficient to establish overall patterns, sequential dependencies and precise classifications of attacks embedded in of low level alerts. This is because there are several ways to cluster a set of alerts especially if the alerts contain clustering criteria that have several values. Consequently, it is difficult to promptly select an appropriate clustering technique for investigating computer attacks and to concurrently handle the tradeoffs between interpretations and clustering of low level alerts effectively. Accordingly, alerts, attacks and corresponding countermeasures are frequently mismatched. Hence, several realistic attacks easily circumvent early detections. Therefore, in this paper, intrusive alerts were clustered and the quality of each cluster was evaluated.

Allowing white spaces to be used in a deregulated manner exposes the radio spectrum to anomalous usage, which in turn may intentionally or unintentionally cause interference to primary users (PUs) as well as secondary users (SUs). In this paper we propose a subspace-based spectrum guarding detector (SSGD) to address the security of unauthorized spectrum usage. In particular, we consider the scenario where ongoing authorized transmissions by PUs have to be preserved from concurrent unauthorized emissions in the same frequency bands. The detector operates in two phases: a training phase where SSGD collects samples of the authorized transmissions, and a detection (on-line) phase where the spectrum is guarded against anomalous emissions. The performance of SSGD is analyzed in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities highlighting the effects of the propagation scenario, the PU characteristics, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the duration of both training and on-line phases. Numerical results show that in practical scenarios SSGD provides a remarkable SNR improvement of several dB over the conventional energy detector (ED).","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247214","","Cognitive radio;Covariance matrices;Detectors;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal to noise ratio;Training","cognitive radio;error statistics;next generation networks;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","PU;SNR improvement;SSGD;anomalous emission;authorized transmission;cognitive radio;concurrent unauthorized emission;dynamic spectrum access;energy detector;false alarm probability;next generation wireless network;phase detection;primary user;secondary user;signal-to-noise ratio;spectrum efficiency;subspace-based spectrum guarding detector;training phase;unauthorized spectrum usage security;white space","","","","","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Differences in pixel intensity are calculated and compared with a fuzzy rule base to calculate edginess. This edginess measure is used to decide whether a pixel belongs to an edge or not. Features extracted from training videos train the Naive Bayesian Classifier which is then used for testing videos. Features are pre-processed using techniques such as Discretize, Fuzzy Logic, Numeric to Binary, PKI Discretize and Normalize. Then, they are filtered using Correlation Feature Selection before training the classifier.

The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235","","Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols","Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes","DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol","","21","","15","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently statistical methods for analyzing the payload are being used. Since behavior of every application is not same a different model is necessary for each application. Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet.

To combat attackers, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) can offer additional security measures for these environments by investigating configurations, logs, network traffic, and user actions to identify typical attack behavior. However, IDS must be distributed to work in a grid computing environment. It must monitor each node and, when an attack occurs, alert other nodes in the environment. This kind of communication requires compatibility between heterogeneous hosts, various communication mechanisms, and permission control over system maintenance and updates.

The sink node in WSN that maintains the database of entire network is also prone to security violations and there is no such security mechanism devised for communicating the data to other nodes. Hence, there is a need to design security scheme with the capabilities to protect the network and the sink node on the occurrence of attack. In this paper, we aim to provide security with a reactive security scheme that includes studying the behavioral aspect of attacks and congregating the security demands. This scheme successively conglomerates the security and the network rescue mechanism free from attacks and their impacts on the network.

As a smart spectrum sharing technology, cognitive radio can change its transmitter parameter based on interactive the environment where it operates. So the MAC address can be easy spoofed in the open air. An attacker can exploit this character to preempt spectrum resources and bring the negative impact to the network. In this paper, we propose a scheme of detecting identity-spoof attack based on Back Propagation (BP) network. The scheme extracts the fingerprint feature of cognitive user to get the received signal strength (RSS). The extracted Eigen values can be used as the input vectors of the BP neural network which are trained by the honest users' RSS. The honest users and the attackers can be divided into two categories by the trained BP network to detect an identity-spoof attack.

However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate. Simulation results corroborate that the use of cooperative cross layer design improves the detection percentage and minimizes the false positive rate.","","978-1-4799-7324-8","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906469","Cooperative;VANETs;cross layer;packet forward","Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","access protocols;cooperative communication;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","MAC monitors;MPR;RTS-CTS;VANET-OLSR;blackhole attack detection;channel collision;clear to send;cooperative cross layer detection;cooperative intrusion detection;cooperative monitoring;cross layer architecture;false alarm rate;multipoint relays;network layers detections;request to send;routing level monitoring;secure optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;watchdog detection","","0","","19","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, using open source web applications is a double-edged sword in that it supplies both attackers and defenders more control over their security aspect. Well-known attacks are aimed access resources that are not referenced by the web application and lead to information discloser. Inspired by the idea of a sniper lurking in the shadows of civilization as a secret guard, this paper proposes a framework-named Sniper-to improve the security of open source web applications. Mimicking a real sniper who hides in the bushes to watch and eliminate dangerous enemies, the proposed Sniper framework is hidden within the web application to capture potential attackers. To illustrate further, if an attacker approaches your website seeking sensitive data, Sniper will be there watching to detect the intrusion, notify the webmaster anonymously, and block the attacker based on predefined thresholds. Therefore, Sniper identifies and mitigates attack attempts ahead of time by monitoring suspicious traffic intended to reach forbidden or sensitive areas. Sniper was implemented and tested using three different open source web applications. As a webmaster, I cannot imagine a better lights-out monitoring solution that not only notifies me, but also blocks potentially malicious access.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051949","","Electronic mail;Monitoring;Security;Testing;Web servers;Web sites","Web sites;computer crime;public domain software","Sniper framework;Webmasters;attack attempts detection;attackers;business Websites;intrusion detection;malicious access;official Websites;open source Web applications;personal Websites;security aspect;sensitive data;social network Websites;suspicious traffic monitoring","","0","","26","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Suricata includes multi-threading to improve processing speed beyond Snort. Previous work comparing the two products has not used a real-world setting. We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its "" backbone"" in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48. We observed no significant speed or accuracy advantage of Suricata over Snort in its current state, but it is still being developed.

A project is underway that has identified six so-called SAREPH characteristics of adversarial self-organizing agility, and is now cataloging patterns toward a pattern language of self-organizing security techniques thatcan be employed for equal or superior security agility. Many such patterns have recently been developed. This paper adds the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to the catalog. The essence of a GA is to express the problem to be optimized in terms of a ""fitness function"" that evaluates how well candidates optimize the solution. In natural evolution fitness is an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. Computing applications abstract fitness to match the problem at hand, such as an Intrusion Detection System attempting to correlate seemingly unrelated events that collectively constitute a threat Reviewed first are the pattern project and the general nature of the GA. A reusable generic pattern description is developed. Howthe pattern conforms to the SAREPH characteristics is shown. Then three examples from the literature show howthe pattern is employed in SAREPH conformity: predator-prey behavior evolution in robotswarms, future behavior prediction in financially traded stocks, and attack detection in an Intrusion Detection System.","1071-6572","978-1-4673-2450-2","978-1-4673-2449-6","10.1109/CCST.2012.6393577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393577","Intrusion detection;SAREPH","Context;Filtering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Graphics;Qualifications;Robots;Security","genetic algorithms;security of data","SAREPH characteristics;attack detection;financially traded stock prediction;fitness function;genetic algorithm pattern;intrusion detection system;pattern language;predator-prey behavior evolution;reusable generic pattern description;robot swarms;self-organizing agile security techniques","","1","","16","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transmittance contrast between x- and y-polarized modes reaches 31.9 dB, which is sensitive enough to monitor any polarization state change in the fiber.

Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a new bio-inspired model which is applied for solving various problems in the field of information security. The unique features AIS encourage the researchers to employ this techniques in variety of applications and especially in intrusion detection systems. Proper IDS design is essential to improve the performance of the IDS. The centralized design of this IDS has disadvantage of central processing for massive processes for each packets passing trough network. In this paper we proposed a distributed multi-layerd framework to enhance the detection performance and efficiency of this IDS. In our design the genetic algorithm is used for enhancing the secondary immune response. The fundamental design of our proposed AIS based IDS consists of 2 main components: IDS central engine and detection sensors. Each of these components is composed of some agents which correlate with each other in order to detect the anomalies and intrusions. Our design goal is to decrease the detection time for each connection by distributing the detectors to each host.","","978-1-4244-8599-4","978-89-88678-32-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5713478","AIS;Agent;Danger Theory;Distributed;IDS","Artificial immune systems;Detectors;Engines;Intrusion detection;Training","artificial immune systems;computer network security;distributed processing;genetic algorithms","AIS;IDS;anomalies detection;artificial immune system;bio-inspired model;distributed model;genetic algorithm;information security;intrusion detection system;network security","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such evidence can be useful for designing efficient countermeasures that will thwart multiple attacks in progress. However, some intruders may take total control of computer networks over time while others may decide to partially compromise certain segments of their targets. Consequently, most intrusion analysts often find it difficult to establish hidden correlations between these two categories of probes and their associated objectives. This paper uses time series analysis to reconstruct workloads using baselines in the range of t<sub>1</sub> = 1s to t<sub>60</sub> = 60s for each intrusion log. Comparisons of the results obtained across different range of datasets demonstrate that alerts triggered by Snort can be used to reconstruct admissible evidence for litigation purposes. The results also reveal the variability of workloads within predefined intervals and the extent that alerts from different intrusion logs resemble each other.","","978-1-4673-1366-7","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205453","Intrusion Detection System;intrusion;intrusion analyst.;patterns of attacks;time series analysis","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computers;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Time series analysis","computer network security","associated objectives;computer crime reconstruction;computer networks;concurrent forecasting;forecasting alerts workload;forensic model;hidden correlations;intrusion detectors;intrusion pattern","","0","","17","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And in many pragmatic applications string pattern matching is the most compute intensive task which takes majority processing time, therefore, in order to improve system efficiency many works have been done around hardware implementation of regular expression matching. However, the traditional design approaches pay more attention on the implementation methods as well as their efficiency than the power consumption. In this paper we provide a power efficient regular expression matching architecture (PeRex). By taking full use of both rising and trailing edges of the system clocks such architecture is able to match two characters in a single system cycle. So, by maintaining the high performance and throughput the architecture in this paper is able to work in a lower clock frequency, consequently it will decrease the dynamic power consumption remarkably. Analyzed by XPower, which offered by Xilinx Inc., our approach is able to save dynamic power consumption by1.7 times comparing to traditional approaches on Virtex-V XC5VLX30 FPGA device.","","978-1-4577-1006-3","978-0-7695-4466-3","10.1109/GreenCom.2011.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061325","FPGA;NFA;power efficient accelerator;regular expression matching","Clocks;Computer architecture;Hardware;Logic gates;Pattern matching;Radiation detectors;Random access memory","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","PeRex;Virtex-V XC5VLX30 FPGA device;XPower;Xilinx Inc;dynamic power consumption;power efficient FPGA-based architecture;power efficient regular expression matching architecture;string pattern matching","","1","","19","","","4-5 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyzed scenario where two users (Alice and Bob) want to exchange hidden message via SIP protocol. Their call is established over Kamailio, SIP Proxy server. We were interested in a number of SIP messages that are exchanged during the call with an average duration of 60 seconds. Then we used SNORT IDS with hard coded rules and AD.SNORT (Anomaly Detection) for detecting irregularities while we increased the number of SIP messages. Finally, we calculated the available steganographic bandwidth, amount of hidden data that can be transferred in these messages.

The system is proposed with the Database Response Policies with two issues Policy Matching and Policy Administration. This system is termed as Joint Threshold Administrative Module (JTAM). The principle used in JTAM is Separation of Duty. The major idea is used to prevent the malicious modification of the policies by database administrators (DBA's). The database modification proposed ought to be signed by k DBA's for complete modified policy. Cryptographic algorithms are used to encrypt the policy and the signatures. The policies are limited for the user's view and for this `pattern concept' is used.

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","978-1-4673-2708-4","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the second stage, we use the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, a calculation that measures the level of difference of two probability distributions, to detect abnormal network activities. The probability distribution of the relative uncertainty for short-term network behavior is compared with that of the long-term profile constructed in the first stage.

After that two intrusion detection techniques for mobile ad-hoc networks, which use collaborative efforts of nodes in a neighborhood to detect a malicious node in that neighborhood are explained. The first technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes in which each pair of nodes in the neighborhood is within radio range of each other. The second technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes, in which each pair of nodes may not be in radio range of each other but where there is a node among them which has all the other nodes in its one-hop vicinity. Both techniques use message passing between the nodes. A node called the monitor node initiates the detection process. Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each node determines the nodes it suspects to be malicious and send votes to the monitor node. The monitor node upon inspecting the votes determines the malicious nodes from among the suspected nodes. Defect of these techniques is the impossibility of detecting wormhole attack in the form of out of band attack so in this paper we complete these techniques to give the ability of detecting wormhole attack and isolating them from routing process.","","978-1-61284-295-0","","10.1109/ICRIIS.2011.6125695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125695","Cluster;Monitor node;Wormhole attack;clique;insert Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET)","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Relays;Routing;Routing protocols","message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;collaborative techniques;intrusion detection;malicious node detection;message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;one-hop vicinity;radio range;routing process;suspected nodes;wormhole attack detection","","1","","20","","","23-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, servers represent a high-value target for collection and analysis of network traffic. The observe, orient, decide, and act (OODA) loop for network attack involves surveillance, to determine if a vulnerability is present, selection of an appropriate exploit, use of the exploit to gain access, and persistence for a time sufficient enough to carry out some effect. The time spent in surveillance and persistence may range from seconds to months depending upon the intent of the attack. This paper describes a novel hypervisor technology that increases attacker workload by denying the ability to carry out surveillance. It also denies persistence, even if the attack is successful and never detected.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-0079-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2011.6127643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6127643","deny persistence;security;virtualiztion;web services","Bridges;IP networks;Surveillance;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Web servers","computer network security;telecommunication traffic;virtual machines","attacker workload;clients;hypervisor technology;modern computer networks;network attack;network traffic;observe orient decide and act loop;servers;virtual machines","","3","","29","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel application layer DDoS attack tool, which mimics human browsing behavior following three statistical distributions, the Zipf-like distribution for web page popularity, the Pareto distribution for page request time interval for an individual browser, and the inverse Gaussian distribution for length of browsing path. A Markov model is established for individual bot to generate attack request traffic. Our experiments indicated that the attack traffic that generated by the proposed tool is pretty similar to the real traffic. As a result, the current statistics based detection algorithms will result high false negative rate in general. In order to counter this kind of attacks, we discussed a few preliminary solutions at the end of this paper.","","978-1-4577-0249-5","978-1-4577-0248-8","10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928949","attack simulation;botnet;browsing behavior","Browsers;Computer crime;Detection algorithms;Equations;Mathematical model;Web pages","Gaussian distribution;Markov processes;Pareto distribution;Web sites;security of data","Markov model;Pareto distribution;Web page popularity;Web site;Zipf-like distribution;application layer DDoS attack tool;attack request traffic;botnet;browsing path length;human browsing behavior;intrusion detection system;inverse Gaussian distribution;page request time interval;statistical distribution","","1","","21","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software vulnerability may jeopardize information confidentiality and cause software failure leading tocatastrophic threats to humans or severe economic losses. Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats. This paper is divided into two parts. It examines promising search based testing approaches to detecting software vulnerabilities, and then presents some of the most interesting open research problems.","","978-1-4244-4356-7","","10.1109/ICSTW.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976374","high dependability software;search based software testing;vulnerability exposure","Application software;Computer security;Costs;Data security;Humans;Production;Software performance;Software safety;Software systems;Software testing","data privacy;program testing;security of data","code breaking;computerized system security;cost-vulnerability problem;information confidentiality;pervasive problem;search based software testing;software failure;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","70","","","1-4 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These networks can be formed, merged or partitioned into separate networks on the fly, without necessarily relying on a fixed infrastructure to manage the operation. Two important properties of an ad-hoc network are that it is self-organized and adaptive. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) where security is a crucial issue, trust plays an important factor that could improve the number of successful data transmission process. The higher the numbers of nodes that trust each other in the network means the higher successful communication process rates could be expected. Since there is no central controller to determine the reliable & Secure communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. In this paper, we provide a model & evidence through experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET Intrusion Detection System (IDS).","","978-1-4244-9033-2","","10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640420","","Engines;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","MANET;data transmission;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;reliable communication paths;secure communication paths","","3","","18","","","17-19 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The established prototype can feed sequence of system calls obtained from a server directly into the BBNN based IDS. The structure and weights of BBNN are evolved by Genetic Algorithms. Experimental performance comparisons have been conducted against four major Support Vector Machines (SVMs) by carrying out leave-one-out cross validation. The results show that the improved BBNN outperforms other algorithms with respect to the classification and detection performances. The false alarm rate is successfully reduced as low as 2.22% while the detection rate 100% is still maintained. The running times of the proposed hardware based IDS versus other software based systems are also discussed.","","978-1-4673-2171-6","","10.1109/KSE.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6299403","block-based neural network;field programmable gate arrays (FPGA);intrusion detection systems","Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Training;Vectors","field programmable gate arrays;genetic algorithms;neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","BBNN;FPGA;IDS;SVM;evolving block-based neural network;field programmable gate arrays;genetic algorithms;host-based intrusion detection system;leave-one-out cross validation;software based systems;software-enabled detection engine;support vector machines","","0","","19","","","17-19 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy. We show the effectiveness of PBC when applying it to a large dataset.","","978-1-4673-7988-5","","10.1109/QRS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272921","Anomaly Detection Systems;Boolean Combination;Intrusion Detection Systems;Multiple-Detector Systems;Pruning Techniques","Accuracy;Boolean functions;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Monitoring;Probability distribution;Training","Boolean algebra;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS;PBC;anomaly detection system;intrusion detection system;machine learning technique;pruning Boolean combination;pruning technique","","","","","","","3-5 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
