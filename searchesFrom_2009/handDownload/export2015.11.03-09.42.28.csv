This has been demonstrated by a growing number of new encryption algorithms, more intelligent firewall and intrusion detection techniques, new developments in multifactor authentication, advances in malware protection and many more. During a similar period of time the industry has seen the need for network infrastructure which provides a greater degree of trust which has resulted in the development of forensic analysis tools which meet the requirements of law enforcement agencies. Such tools must provide for commercial intelligence and national security. This paper proposes that application of the common ground between security and forensics has great potential to provide for improvements in the effort to achieve real-time adaptive security. This implies an architecture which can detect security breaches and in real-time record and analyse traffic logs in a forensically sound manner, provide corrective feedback to security devices and attempt to trace back to the source of the attack. In addressing computer security and forensic analysis from a real-time perspective, this paper recognises that some of these processes already exist, but proposes methods whereby the ongoing damage and potential risk to critical infrastructure can be reduced. This requires the implementation of a highly integrated approach to security and forensics such that they can inter-work in real-time in order to address the significant security issues which currently face the industry.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","978-0-7695-4159-4","10.1109/NSS.2010.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635616","critical infrastructure;network forensics;real-time adaptive security","Adaptive systems;Computer architecture;Fires;Forensics;Real time systems;Security;Servers","authorisation;computer forensics;real-time systems","firewall;forensic analysis tools;intrusion detection techniques;multifactor authentication;network security design;real-time adaptive security","","1","","11","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, authentication mechanisms are the only barrier to prevent those attacks. Traditional password-based authentication is efficient (especially from the user point of view), but not effective -- the lack of continuous verification is a severe access control vulnerability. To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials. Therefore, extending the IDS concept to the user authentication level appears as a promising security control. The need to distinguish human users (user-centric anomaly-based detection) leads to the use of biometric features. In this paper we present a secure, reliable, inexpensive and non-intrusive technique for complementing traditional static authentication mechanisms with continuous identity verification, based on keystroke dynamics biometrics.","","978-1-4673-2624-7","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384970","access control;authentication;biometrics;identity theft;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;security","Access control;Authentication;Databases;Humans;Intrusion detection;Keyboards","authorisation;message authentication","access control vulnerability;continuous access control enforcement;continuous identity monitoring;digital identities;host-based IDS concept;human users;information systems;keystroke dynamics biometrics;legitimate user credentials;malicious activity;non-intrusive technique;password-based authentication;security control;static authentication mechanisms;user-centric anomaly-based detection","","2","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results indicated that a static baseline profile delivers similar results to other baseline profile methods.

This working lets the security manager more comfy. The state machine based attack scenario reconstruction technology processes security events using clustering analysis and causal analysis concurrently, it builds a correlation state machine in memory for every attack scenario tree which is predefined by the security manager, when security events are coming, the current state set of the correlation state machine will process them, if the condition is satisfied, the current states of the state machine will transfer, it corresponds to the developing of the multi-step attack. If one of the leaf nodes of the state machine is in its current state set, an attack scenario description information will be generated and then sent to the security manager. The correlating technology based on state machine is more timely and accurately, and at last, we use the DARPA2000 Intrusion Scenario Specific Data Sets to validate the technology, the experiment results show that it is feasible to analyze security events using the technology we proposed.","","978-1-4244-5537-9","","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563843","attack scenario reconstruction;attack scenario tree;causal analysis;clustering analysis;correlating state machine","Computational modeling;Computers;Correlation;Security;XML","computer network security;correlation methods;finite state machines;pattern clustering","DARPA2000 intrusion scenario specific data sets;attack scenario reconstruction technology;clustering analysis;correlation state machine;cyberspace;security devices;security events correlation;state machine","","1","","13","","","9-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to identify and to cluster different alerts-produced by low-level intrusion detection systems, firewalls, etc.-belonging to a specific attack instance which has been initiated by an attacker at a certain point in time. Thus, meta-alerts can be generated for the clusters that contain all the relevant information whereas the amount of data (i.e., alerts) can be reduced substantially. Meta-alerts may then be the basis for reporting to security experts or for communication within a distributed intrusion detection system. We propose a novel technique for online alert aggregation which is based on a dynamic, probabilistic model of the current attack situation. Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low. In addition, meta-alerts are generated with a delay of typically only a few seconds after observing the first alert belonging to a new attack instance.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5210116","Intrusion detection;alert aggregation;data stream algorithm.;generative modeling","","maximum likelihood estimation;security of data","distributed intrusion detection system;firewalls;generative data stream modeling;maximum likelihood approach;meta-alerts;online intrusion alert aggregation;probabilistic model","","12","","44","","2009-08-21","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced. This string matching algorithm can be implemented in FPGA, which can provide very fast and efficient scanning with less memory space occupied. They are designed and simulated in VHDL using Modelsim tool.","","978-1-4244-4789-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204400","Field programmable gate array;Hash;Network intrusion detection System;payload scanning","Communication system traffic control;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer networks;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;string matching;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;Modelsim tool;VHDL;Word Split Hash algorithm;content-based security threats;hardware based pattern matching;hash based algorithm;high speed network;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet header;packet inspection;packet payload;payload scanning;string matching algorithm;virus detection","","0","","10","","","4-6 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users who are connected to the internet are able to access various internet services provided by critical information infrastructure. However, some organisations have not effectively secured their critical information infrastructure and hackers, disgruntled employees and other entities have taken advantage of this by launching cyberattacks on their critical information infrastructure. They do this by using cyberthreats to exploit vulnerabilities in critical information infrastructure which organisations fail to secure. As a result, cyberthreats are able to steal or damage confidential information stored on systems or take down websites, preventing access to information. Despite this, risk strategies can be used to implement a number of security controls: preventive, detective and corrective controls, which together form a system of controls. This will ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is preserved, thus reducing risks to information. This system of controls is based on the General Systems Theory, which states that the elements of a system are interdependent and contribute to the operation of the whole system. Finally, a model is proposed to address insecure critical information infrastructure.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2014.7028160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028160","Critical Information Infrastructure;Cyberattacks;Cyberthreats;Security Controls;Vulnerabilities","Availability;Computer crime;Malware;Personnel;Planning","Internet;business data processing;computer crime;data integrity;data privacy;risk management","Internet service access;confidential information stealing;corrective control;critical information infrastructure protection;cyberattacks;cyberthreats;detective control;disgruntled employees;general systems theory;hackers;information access;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;organisational information;preventive control;risk reduction;security controls;vulnerability exploitation","","0","","20","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A harder problem to crack in the field of Network Security is the identification and prevention of attacks. An effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. Intrusion detection systems include pattern analysis techniques to discover useful patterns of system features. These patterns describe user behavior. Anomalies are computed using the set of relevant system features. The derived patterns comprise inputs of classification systems, which are based on statistical and machine learning pattern recognition techniques. Clustering methods are useful in detection of unknown attack patterns. Elimination of insignificant features is essential for a simplified, faster and more accurate detection of attacks. Genetic algorithm based clustering offers identification of significant reduced input features.

On the other side firewalls have optimized several times and different types have been introduced. Today by integrating NIDS and firewall a new product comes to the market, which is called IPS. IPSs protect information systems from unauthorized access, damage or disruption. They are installed on network primary point and perform deep packet inspection (6 layers) so the hardware should be fast enough to sit almost invisibly within the network. This policy requires expensive hardware which is based on multiple server processor technology. It also needs appropriate changes in network design and policies. The cost may not be so reasonable for medium and small size companies. In this paper we are going to implement some kind of integration between signature-based NIDS and packet filtering firewalls which would increase the overall security by a reasonable cost in compare with modern IPSs. We try to conclude this by optimizing snort as a famous open source NIDS with a sample firewall program in Linux which is implemented by means of IPTABLES commands. The data is transferred in standard XML format.

Because WSNs in general and in nature are unattended and physically reachable from the outside world, they could be vulnerable to physical attacks in the form of node capture or node destruction. These forms of attacks are hard to protect against and require intelligent prevention methods. It is necessary for WSNs to have security measures in place as to prevent an intruder from inserting compromised nodes in order to decimate or disturb the network performance. In this paper we present an intrusion detection algorithm for wireless sensor networks which does not require prior knowledge of network behavior or a learning period in order to establish this knowledge. We have taken a more practical approach and constructed this algorithm with small to middle-size networks in mind, like home or office networks. The proposed algorithm is also dynamic in nature as to cope with new and unknown attack types. This algorithm is intended to protect the network and ensure reliable and accurate aggregated sensor readings.

"Cyber-physical security in a substation","Junho Hong; Stefanov, A.; Chen-Ching Liu; Govindarasu, M.","Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2012 IEEE","20121110","2012","","","1","1","New technologies including microprocessor-based Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and standardized protocol and TCP/IP over wide area networks (WAN) are well-adopted in the substations. Remote access to IEDs or user interfaces in a substation for maintenance purposes is a common practice. However, there are potential cyber-physical system vulnerabilities in a substation, e.g., unsecured standard protocols, remote controllable IEDs, and unauthorized remote access to substation IEDs. In addition, some substation IEDs and user interfaces have a web server and hence it may provide a remote configuration change and control with default passwords. Even if firewalls and cryptography schemes are used for cyber security, weak security key management cryptography and mis-configured firewalls are still exposed to intruders. From IT point of view, cyber security issues are well known and new security technologies are available. However, security research on the integration of IT and physical power systems for critical infrastructures is still an emerging area. Intruders behaviors will generate logs across all substation-level networks, e.g., IEDs, firewalls and user interfaces. For instance, the steps of Stuxnet attack are based on: (1) intrusion attempts, (2) change of the file system, (3) change of target systems setting, and (4) change of target systems status. Therefore, anomaly detection is performed based on logs of intruders foot prints. Temporal anomaly can be determined from discrepancies between event logs from two different time periods. In the proposed anomaly index, a value of 0 implies no difference, whereas 1 indicates the maximal discrepancy [1]. In order to identify the impact of substation cyber intrusion to the power grid, cyber intrusion scenarios have been conducted on the substation IT network using a SCADA testbed at University College Dublin (UCD). The first intrusion scenario involves compromised substation gateway. A false signal is generated and - n open circuit breaker (CB) command is sent to substation CBs. The second scenario is to generate forged CB status at the gateway. As a result of this attack, control center operators will observe fake data about the CB status. However, the actual substation CBs status has not changed. The third scenario is to generate fabricated analogue values to a control center using a man-in-the-middle attack. Once an intruder successfully compromises the substation LAN, (s)he is able to monitor and capture all measured data which comes from power grids. If attackers send fabricated data to the control center and the data travel through the state estimation filter, control center operators will observe an operational emergency. As a result, the operators may take emergency control actions such as reducing the generation voltage or reactive power while the power system is actually in a normal condition. There is a possibility these (logical) actions based on fabricated data will drive the system into a sequence of cascading events, leading to a power outage. Mitigation actions are conducted on substation IT and power grid. For IT mitigation, intrusion detection system (IDS) which uses anomaly detection algorithm based on temporal event construction has been used in a substation network. An Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm with an objective function that minimizes load shedding in the grid is used for power system mitigation. The proposed collaboration scheme between IDS and the firewall is able to disconnect intruders in the substation network. Emergency control actions are taken to mitigate the effects of cyber intrusions as an attempt to restore a system back to a normal condition.","1944-9925","978-1-4673-2727-5","978-1-4673-2728-2","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345766","","Circuit breakers;Computer security;Educational institutions;Substations;User interfaces","Internet;SCADA systems;cryptography;firewalls;load shedding;microprocessor chips;power grids;power system security;substations;transport protocols;user interfaces;wide area networks","IT mitigation;SCADA;Stuxnet attack;TCP/IP;Web server;anomaly detection;control center operators;cyberphysical security;emergency control;firewalls;intruders foot prints;intrusion attempts;intrusion detection system;key management cryptography;load shedding;man-in-the-middle attack;microprocessor based intelligent electronic devices;objective function;open circuit breaker command;optimal power flow algorithm;power grids;power system mitigation;remote access;remote configuration;standardized protocol;state estimation filter;substation cyber intrusion;substation gateway;user interfaces;wide area networks","","0","","1","","","22-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques such as SOM (self-organizing map) are more appropriate for an auto-mated network management such as configuration, performance and anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an auto-mated network management based on hierarchical SOM that groups similar data and visualize their clusters.

Design of an efficient and reliable node authentication protocol for such networks is a particularly challenging task since the nodes are battery-driven and resource constrained. This paper presents a robust and efficient key exchange protocol for nodes authentication in a MANET based on multi-path communication.

Therefore, sensor networks need to support an authentication service for sensor identity and message transmission. Furthermore, intrusion detection and prevention schemes are always integrated in sensor security appliances so that they can enhance network security by discovering malicious or compromised nodes.

Hence, alert correlation techniques are used to provide a complementary analysis to link elementary alerts and provide a more global intrusion view. We propose an alert correlation and aggregation framework based on requires/provides model.

Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060942","Security;smart distirbution grid;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Communication system security;Network security;Physical layer;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","power distribution;power system security;safety systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks","SDG;WMN;backbone power network;intrusion detection;low cost high speed links;power transmission;response scheme;security framework;smart power distribution grid;smart tracking firewall;wireless communication network;wireless mesh networks;wireless networks","","30","","24","","2011-10-25","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. In this paper, we have implemented I-Apriori a candidate generation algorithm and I- PrefixSpan a pattern growth algorithm to detect time interval denial of service (DoS) attack sequences on network traffic data of KDD Cup 1999, 10 percent of training dataset, which is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the leading professional organization of data miners.

This study aims to optimize threshold parameters, the size of which increases with the number of traffic sequence. Different values of network traffic sequence were generated and simulated by the NS2 tool. Based on these values, the detection rates of the CUSUM algorithm and multi-class CUSUM algorithms, as well as their false positive rates, are then evaluated.

Temporal locality can also be viewed as redundancy and we observe significant redundancy in the packet payload. We investigate mechanisms to exploit temporal locality in a networking application and choose Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) as a case study. An IDS like the popular Snort [4] operates by scanning packet payload for known attack strings. It first builds a Finite State Machine (FSM) from a database of attack strings, and traverses this FSM using bytes from the packet payload. So we propose a redundancy-aware FSM traversal that skips the processing of redundant bytes. We have deployed our redundancy-aware FSM traversal in Snort, and we observe important performance benefits.","","978-1-4673-1143-4","978-1-4673-1145-8","10.1109/ISPASS.2012.6189211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189211","","Acceleration;Automata;Clocks;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Redundancy","computer network security;finite state machines;string matching","Snort;attack string;commodity multicore;finite state machine;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;networking application;packet header field;packet payload redundancy;packet payload scanning;pattern matching;redundancy-aware FSM traversal;redundant bytes;temporal locality","","0","","4","","","1-3 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption. Finally, we show that our approach is easy to install and configure across all Android platforms including mobile phones, tablets, and small notebooks without any user perceivable delay for most of the regular Android applications.","","978-1-4673-1796-2","978-0-7695-4713-8","10.1109/MDM.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341374","Encrypted filesystem;Full disk encryption;I/O performance;Smart handheld devices","Databases;Encryption;Kernel;Libraries;Smart phones","cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;input-output programs;smart phones;telecommunication security","Android;FUSE;I/O-intensive program;NIST certified cryptographic algorithm;PII data;SMS;data-at-rest;database transaction performance;email;encrypted operation;encryption filesystem;end user privacy;file system in user space;heterogeneous smart gadget device;location-based service;mobile device;personal identifiable information;read operation;security;smart handheld device;smart phone;social media;tablet;write operation","","5","","33","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, detection is non-trivial: the detector must be able to recognize the symptoms against a background of a range of other (ldquosaferdquo) activities, which also consume system resources. Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection). Therefore, we wished to explore the potential of an economical approach that explicitly takes into account resources used. In order to achieve our aim, we explore the possibility of making use of the existing widely deployed management information database (the MIB) as the basis for detecting attempts to install Trojan software on networked systems. We identify the characteristics of typical attacks in respect of the impact they have on particular MIB objects, and propose a decision-tree based algorithm which can detect Trojan activity.

The positioning process is composed of two parts. One is the spot location, which acquires the position of the imaging spot of the incident beam. The other is the mapping from spot location to incident angle, with which the position of imaging spot can be turned into the angles of the incident beam. For the first part, an improved centroid locating algorithm is present to realize the subpixel accuracy of spot location, and theory and simulation are carried out to demonstrate the improved accuracy of this algorithm. For the second part, we propose the fisheye lens calibration algorithm, which integrates the fisheye lens projection model and natural neighbor interpolation algorithm. In addition, by combining with the measured data, the angle detection accuracy of this method can be improved gradually with the increased number of the measured data.

One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with the advent of collaborative computing and data sharing, more and more new modes of interaction have evolved resulting in the need and use of distributed resources. Work within this community has led to the development of Grid technologies, which address precisely these problems. In grid computing, heterogeneous resources distributed geographically are virtualized as a unified whole. Grid computing, as a result, provides enormous opportunities in terms of resource sharing, maximization of resource utilization and virtualization of resources. Because of its immense potential, not only the scientific community, but also the IT enterprise communities are excited about its prospect. A recent survey ranked grid computing as sixth on priority lists for IT spending among industry professionals. With this much interest, security becomes necessary to provide authentication, authorization, resource protection, secure communication, data confidentiality, data integrity, trust policies management, user key and credential management, service protection, and network security. This paper provides an insight classification of the different mechanisms and methods of security in grid computing environment, and also discusses the solutions for each category and its limitation in order to define the real problems in grid computing security. In our approach, we categorize the security solutions into Resources Level, Service Level, Authentication & Authorization Level, Information Level, and Management Level Solutions.","","978-1-4244-3756-6","978-1-4244-3757-3","10.1109/MMCS.2009.5256638","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5256638","Authentication;Authorization;Certificates;Credentials;GSI;Grid Computing;Intrusion Detection;Sandboxing;Security;Virtualization","Authentication;Authorization;Computer network management;Data security;Environmental management;Grid computing;Information security;Protection;Resource management;Resource virtualization","authorisation;data integrity;grid computing;pattern classification;resource allocation;virtual machines","authentication-authorization level;collaborative computing;credential management;data confidentiality;data integrity;data sharing;grid computing security mechanism classification;network security;resource protection;resource sharing;resource utilization;resource virtualization;secure communication;service protection;trust policy management","","6","1","37","","","2-4 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the Internet becomes more open to public, most people and organizations prefer to use online services. At the same time, the Internet security problem is becoming more severe. An effective and feasible protection measure for network security is necessary. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a typical measure used to provide protection for information systems. In order to detect unknown attacks, anomaly detection technique is a commonly used method. Meanwhile, many scholars are studying more effective and easy-to-use anomaly detection methods. In this paper, a new intrusion detection approach inspired by the function of biological memory cell is proposed. The detectors in this approach (which called memory detector) are more effective than common detectors. The generation method of memory detector is detailed. In order to analyze and evaluate the performance of this approach, comparative experiments are implemented with training and testing data from “Knowledge Discovery and Data mining cup 1999” (KDD99) dataset. The results show that our approach provides better performance than ordinary anomaly detection approaches with higher true positive rate and lower false positive rate.","","978-1-4673-1696-5","978-1-4673-1695-8","10.1109/ICCPS.2012.6384293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384293","anomaly detection;biological immunity;intrusion detection;memory cell;memory detector","Computers;Detectors;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Training","Internet;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security","IDS;Internet security problem;anomaly detection technique;biological memory cell;generation method;information system protection;intrusion detection system;memory detector;network security;online services;performance evaluation;protection measure","","0","","10","","","19-21 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that Â¿learning by teachingÂ¿ may reduce the query costs for teachers and allow for a proactive behavior of organic agents: Before certain situations emerge in their environment, they are already enabled to deal with that situations.

WSN is very sensitive to various attacks, hence Security has become prominent issue in WSNs. Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attack is one of main concern for WSNs. DOS Attack diminishes the resources of sensor nodes which affect the normal functioning of the node. Media Access Control (MAC) layer is responsible for communication within multiple access networks and incorporates shared medium. Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media Access Control (FSMAC) Protocol gives good solution against DOS Attack. It detects all intrusion taking place and also decreases average energy consumed by the sensor network than in attacked scenario. These results are responsible for increase in the lifespan of a sensor network. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty for human reasoning and decision making. Innovational use of Fuzzy logic theory is applied to this FSMAC protocol to enhance the performance. Here in this paper, Reinvention in FSMAC protocol is proposed using new intrusion detector parameters like No of times node sensed channel free and Variation in channel sense period. Performance of new protocol is tested on the basis of time of first node dead and average energy consumed by the sensor node. These results show that the lifespan of sensor network increases and average energy consumed by sensor node decreases.","","","","10.1109/ICICICT.2014.6781305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781305","Denial-Of-Service (DOS) Attack;Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media access Control Protocol (FSMAC);Media Access Control (MAC) Protocol;Security Issues;Wireless Sensor Networks","Frequency division multiaccess;Indexes;Protocols;Receivers;Uncertainty;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;cryptographic protocols;decision making;energy consumption;fuzzy logic;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DOS attack;FSMAC protocol;WSN improvement;decision making;denial of service;energy consumption;fuzzy logic secure media access control protocol;human reasoning;intrusion detector parameter;multiple access networks;sensor nodes;uncertainty handling;wireless sensor network","","0","","17","","","7-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud computing has made a large impact on the computing industry in recent years. Whether being utilized to provide highly scalable robust environments for applications or just being used as a marketing ploy, one thing is certain: cloud computing has the potential to yet again change the way we interact with computer systems. There is just one major factor separating cloud computing from becoming widely accepted both personally and commercially and that is security. As cloud systems re-innovate ways of request distribution and load balancing, it is important to test these systems against attacks such as the denial of service attack. There is a strong emphasis on researching these attacks since cloud computing is re-inventing the payment systems in which consumers utilize resources. This paper examines the Google App Engine and its resilience to denial of service attacks. Further the paper demonstrates the strain such an attack has on the servers that facilitate the services and finally discuss the preventative measures set in place by Google and how they are only temporary solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2015.7069370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069370","Cloud Computing;Cloud Computing Security;Denial of Service;Google App Engine;Network Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Databases;Engines;Google;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;social networking (online)","Facebook;Google App Engine;Internet;Twitter;cloud computing;denial of service attacks;load balancing;request distribution;social media services","","0","","8","","","16-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modern algorithms offer sophisticated video-based intrusion detection and tracking capabilities that were unavailable a decade earlier. The modern video analytics have been shown to have a significant reduction of previously observed high nuisance alarm rates with improved detection capabilities. This paper includes results of a recent device evaluation performed at Sandia National Laboratories for a representative exterior intrusion detection application. For this limited scope effort, the device was evaluated for probability of detection and monitored for nuisance and false alarms over a six-month period from September 2010 to April 2011 (nuisance alarm cause is detailed).

The proposed ID algorithm will employ a statistical data classification technique based on the real-time tracking of the user behavior. Two statistical algorithms are proposed for the implementation of these additional features of the system. Importance sampling technique will be employed to select the attributes for the knowledge-based authentication stage while the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm will form the basis of the intrusion detection part of the system.

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed. The design is hardware based and suitable for networking and security querying applications.","","","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926138","Bloom filter;H3 hash function;compactness;counting bloom filter;cryptographic hash function field programmable array;false positive ratio;membership querying;parallel bloom Filter;standard bloom Filter;whirlpool hash function","Arrays;Cryptography;Hardware;Information filters;Radiation detectors;Standards","cryptography;data structures;dictionaries;field programmable gate arrays","Xilinx;arbitrary length;bloom filter variants;bloom filters;cryptographic hash function whirlpool;data structure technique;dynamic membership querying;false positive ratios;field programmable gate array;fixed-length output;hash based structures;information compaction;intelligent dictionary;mapping scheme;network security;networking application;noncryptographic form;performance matrix;security application;spell check application;target technology;universal H3 hash function;whirlpool hash based bloom filter","","0","","30","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By analyzing real HTTP traffic and real Web application firewall signatures, we show that up to 84% of the data can be skipped in its scan. Surprisingly, we show that it is faster to perform pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than on regular traffic.

By measuring the density of antibody in current system, the danger of network attack in the system can be captured correctly. A new network security evaluation method using antibody concentration to quantitatively analyze the degree of intrusion danger level is presented. And the intrusion detection mechanism based on self-tolerance, clone selection, and immune surveillance is established. The experimental results show that the new model improves the ability of intrusion detection and prevention than that of the traditional passive intrusion prevention systems.","","978-1-4244-3692-7","978-1-4244-3693-4","10.1109/WICOM.2009.5301894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5301894","","Artificial immune systems;Cloning;Current measurement;Density measurement;Feedback;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Pathogens;Surveillance","artificial immune systems;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","antibody density change;artificial immune system;clone selection based system;dynamical immunological surveillance;human immune system function;immune feedback function;intrusion danger analyzation;intrusion detection mechanism;network attack;network danger evaluation model;network security evaluation method;pathogen invasion intensity;self-tolerance based system","","0","","11","","","24-26 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data mining techniques are efficient to construct a reliable Intrusion Detection System. Classification is an essential task in data mining. In this paper, a new classification method is proposed to build an accurate and efficient classifier for intrusion detection. The new classification method utilizes the average distances of the new data to its closest neighbor points to classify it as normal or intrusion. Then, the distances of the data to the centroids of normal, misuse intrusion and anomaly intrusion is used to get the accurate class label of the data. In addition, this paper integrates Fuzzy GNP-based class association rule mining method to extract rules. Fuzzy GNP avoids the use of the domain knowledge and solves the continuous attributes efficiently. On the basis of the extracted rules, the multi-feature space is projected into a two-dimensional average matching degree space. The benchmark data KDD Cup 1999 and NSL-KDD are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.","","978-1-4673-1713-9","978-1-4673-1712-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377960","Average Matching Degree;Centroid;Distance;Fuzzy GNP;Intrusion Detection System","Association rules;Data models;Economic indicators;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Training data","Internet;computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;pattern classification","2D average matching degree space;Internet usage;KDD Cup 1999 data;NSL-KDD data;anomaly intrusion;classification method;data mining technique;distance-based classification;domain knowledge;fuzzy GNP rule mining;genetic network programming;intrusion detection system;misuse intrusion;multifeature space;network security;normal intrusion;rule extraction","","0","","10","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This opening, a prior beneficial, nevertheless raises a major problem: it ensues from it an increasing number of attacks. The IDS was developed with the aim of detecting abnormal functioning of information systems and networks, indicating that actions not corresponding to the safety policy are led by one or several users. Centralized IDS suffer from significant limitations when used in high speed networks, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper we propose a distributed hybrid approach based on mobile agents for the detection of intrusion: HAMA-IDS (Hybrid Approach based on Mobile Agents for Intrusion Detection System). The proposed approach uses the platform Aglets for the creation and the distribution of four types of mobile agents. The Collector agent is used to the gathering of information, when the Analyzer and Redirector agent are responsible of the analysis (scenarios and behavioral analysis). The generator agent is responsible to the launch of these agents and to the management of messages received from these last ones.","","978-1-4673-2226-3","","10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360647","Aglets;Mobile Agents;hybrid approach;intrusion detection system","Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Java;Mobile agents;Pattern matching","Internet;information systems;mobile agents;security of data","HAMA-IDS;Internet;aglets;analyzer agent;centralized IDS;collector agent;distributed attacks;distributed hybrid approach;generator agent;high speed networks;hybrid approach based on mobile agents for intrusion detection system;information systems;mobile agents;redirector agent;safety policy","","1","","16","","","1-3 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An appropriate intrusion detection system is an inevitable requirement. Using anomaly based intrusion detection system results in the false positive identification of the intrusion. Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed.

To tackle the strict limitation of energy supplication in large scale WSN, hierarchical structure of WSN is proposed by seperating WSN into many jointed cluster with a Cluster Head (CH) in each clusters. Hierarchical structure is a useful mechanism used to prolong lifetime of WSN. It is a critical problem that how many clusters should be separated. Suitable cluster number will prolong the lifetime of WSN and reduce energy dissipated in Cluster Head (CH) selection per round. Considering the character of communication scope of node in cluster, there exist areas of redundant place between jointed clusters.

Each regular expression (regex) is first parsed into a concise token list representation, then compiled to a modular nondeterministic finite automaton (RE-NFA) using a modified version of the McNaughton-Yamada algorithm. The RE-NFA can be mapped directly onto a compact register-transistor level (RTL) circuit. A number of optimizations are applied to improve the circuit performance: 1) spatial stacking is used to construct an REM circuit processing m ≥ 1 input characters per clock cycle; 2) single-character constrained repetitions are matched efficiently by parallel shift-register lookup tables; 3) complex character classes are matched by a BRAM-based classifier shared across regexes; 4) a multipipeline architecture is used to organize a large number of RE-NFAs into priority groups to limit the I/O size of the circuit.

Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-dimensional Clustering method for Short-time scale Traffic(MCST) to classify abnormal and normal traffic.

Inspired by the game theory, in this research work, we model the interactions between the attacker and the adaptation manager as a two-player zero-sum Markov game. Using this game-theoretic approach, the adaptation manager can refine its strategies in dynamic attack scenarios by utilizing what has learned from the system's and adversary's actions.

Some intrusion detection systems aim to authenticate legitimate users once they log in to the system, as well as to prevent access to unauthorized people who try to impersonate other users. The main goal of this paper is to introduce and implement a novel approach that uses the fingerprint technique to complement a host-based intrusion detection system in order to improve its level of authentication, which would allow us to detect more effectively any misuse of the computer system that is running it.","","978-1-4244-7963-4","978-0-7695-4152-5","10.1109/ICIIC.2010.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5571460","","Authentication;Computers;Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Mice","biometrics (access control);security of data","authentication function;biometric authentication;computer system access;intrusion detection systems","","0","","16","","","5-7 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attack graph is commonly used for analyzing network security level for its capability in reflecting all network vulnerabilities and their inter relationships. However, attack graph assumes an over pessimistic situation by giving the attacker unlimited power of exploiting each chain of vulnerabilities in the network, leading the complexity of analyzing to grow exponentially with the size of network. Therefore, the weakest paths suggested by such analysis could be inaccurate for adversary with limited computation power. In this paper, we investigate how attackers are planning to exploit vulnerabilities towards their targets and present the idea of a goal-oriented analysis of attack graph to address this problem. We give algorithms for analyzing network vulnerabilities, predicting attackers's potential target, and giving suggestions on patching the weakest nodes based on attackers' targets.","","978-1-4244-5941-4","978-1-4244-5943-8","10.1109/ICISA.2010.5480282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480282","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Independent component analysis;National security;Performance analysis;Power system security;Protection;Software performance;Software systems;Software tools","computer network security","attack graph analyzing;attack graph modeling;critical systems;goal-oriented approach;network security;network vulnerabilities","","2","","27","","","21-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These attacks, also known as multistage attacks, are composed of several stages and originated from multiple sources (hosts). Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) do not tackle adequately such attacks, mainly due to the lack of mechanisms for uniform communication with distinct security systems (e.g., other IDSes, firewalls, etc.) and for the correlation, in a timely manner, of the observed events. In a first attempt to address the aforementioned issues, in this paper we propose a solution for the detection of multistage, distributed attacks based on the creation of security oriented Web Services. The solution comprises two key components: (i) a novel language for the specification of the diverse stages that compose a multistage attack, and (ii) SECCOMPOSE, a service oriented architecture for multistage, distributed attack detection.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-4672-8","978-1-4244-4671-1","10.1109/ISCC.2009.5202369","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202369","","Communication system security;Computer crime;Distributed computing;File systems;Informatics;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Sockets;Web server;Web services","Web services;security of data;software architecture;specification languages","SECCOMPOSE;Web Services;multistage distributed attacks detection;security mechanisms;service oriented architecture;specification language","","0","","7","","","5-8 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors. A set of simulations is conducted for validating the feasibility and evaluating the performance of our proposed framework.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199233","","Autonomous agents;Communications Society;Cost function;Event detection;Humans;Impedance;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Optimization methods","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","ADRS sensor;MANET;accidental system errors;anomalous events;autonomous agent;cost-sensitive anomaly detection;decision-theoretical framework;detection accuracy;detection cost;detection performance;false positive rate;intentional attacks;key evaluation metrics;mobile ad hoc networks;operational cost;policy gradient algorithms;response cost;response system","","0","","14","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Live Sec employs a new Access-Switching layer to provide: 1) interactive policy-enforcement that enables fine-grain control for the end-to-end traffic of network tenants or users, 2) distributed load-balancing that dynamically dispatches security workload over incrementally-deployed security service elements, 3) application-aware network visualization that helps to identify and locate security events, via live traffic monitoring and historical traffic replay.

"Towards feature subset selection in intrusion detection","Ahmad, I.; e Amin, F.","Dept. of Software Eng., King Saud Univ., Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC), 2014 IEEE 7th Joint International","20150323","2014","","","68","73","Intrusion is a serious issue in computer and network systems because a single intrusion can cause a heavy loss in few seconds. To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization approach based on the behavioral study of animals/birds that outperforms GA in some applications. Therefore, the PSO based method is proposed in feature subset selection in this research work.","","978-1-4799-4420-0","","10.1109/ITAIC.2014.7065007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065007","Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm (GA);Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO);Subset","Computers;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature selection;genetic algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data","GA;PCA;PSO;computer systems;discriminative subset;eigenspace;eigenvalues;false alarms;feature subset selection;genetic algorithm;network systems;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;principal component analysis;robust intrusion detection system","","0","","20","","","20-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition nodes or groups of nodes may defect, which is a particular concern in coalition environments where networks may spread beyond organizational boundaries. To identify defecting or compromised nodes including Byzantine behavior we propose a clustered intrusion detection architecture. Our architecture exploits multisensor data and supplementary information to identify defectors based on deviations from predicted values and correlated measurements and behavior. Furthermore multi-hop communication complexity is minimized to ensure robustness in environments with limited connectivity and frequent network partitioning. We show that our approach improves accuracy over naive Markov chain and Kullback-Leibler divergence by boosting the number of particles, where probability density functions are highly nonlinear but partially known and can be determined using predictive importance sampling.","","978-1-4244-5238-5","978-1-4244-5239-2","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379782","","Complexity theory;Computer graphics;Information security;Intrusion detection;Particle filters;Probability density function;Protocols;Robustness;Spread spectrum communication;State estimation","Markov processes;ad hoc networks;communication complexity;importance sampling;military communication;mobile radio;sensor fusion;state estimation;telecommunication security","Byzantine behavior identification;Kullback-Leibler divergence;clustered intrusion detection architecture;efficient state estimation;multi-hop communication complexity;multisensor data;naive Markov chain;network partitioning;organizational boundaries;predictive importance sampling;probability density functions;tactical MANET;tactical mobile ad-hoc networks","","1","","20","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since Cloud is a Data Centre there are conceivable chances of attacks on it. Cloud behaves like a group of interconnected systems since it is run on the backdrop through Distributed systems. Various attacks like DOS, DDOS, Malware Injection attack, Man-In-The-Middle attacks are possible. This paper discusses various Mining attacks that are possible on a Cloud and provides a solution by using a Secure Distributed approach. We use WEKA to predict the patterns in a single cloud and by using Cloud Data Distributor with a secure distributed approach we provide an effective solution that prevents such mining attacks on Cloud thus making the Cloud a secure platform for service and storage.","","978-1-4673-2816-6","","10.1109/ICACT.2013.6710509","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6710509","Attackers;Cloud Data Distributor;Cloud mines;Distribution of data;Encoding;Encryption;Fragmentation;Hashing;Mining attacks;Storage;categorization","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Data mining;Distributed databases;Encoding;Security;Servers","cloud computing;computer centres;data mining;data privacy","WEKA;cloud computing;cloud data distributor;data centre;data mining attacks;distributed cloud;secure distributed approach;user privacy preservation","","0","","19","","","21-22 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Presence of such nodes results in congestion in paths, unreliable packet delivery and erroneous data outputs for wireless sensor networks. Existing literatures have addressed this problem using protocols with mechanisms to detect the presence of these misbehaving nodes and ignoring them altogether while delivering a packet. However, design and deployments costs are on the higher side for sensor nodes and ignoring a node entirely blocks a relay node for multiple paths passing through it resulting in inefficient use of resources. In this paper we introduce a protocol named as MMP (Misbehavior Management Protocol) to differentiate between a black hole node and a selective forwarding node. By differentiating between these two types of misbehaving nodes, paths can be chosen intelligently for the packets which might be blocked or might be allowed to pass through a node. Hence our protocol presents a misbehaving selective forwarding node as an operational node to sensors nodes whose packets are not being blocked by the node. This allows higher throughput, multiple options for selecting paths as well as more accurate data collection from the sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks.","2153-1676","","","10.1109/ANTS.2013.6802887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802887","Blackholes;Misbehaving nodes;Selective forwarding nodes;Wireless sensor networks","Base stations;Protocols;Relays;Reliability;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication congestion control;wireless sensor networks","MMP;ad hoc networks;black hole node;intelligent management;misbehaving nodes;misbehavior management protocol;operational node;protocols;relay node;selective forwarding node;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","0","","22","","","15-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is important for the DBMS to have an idea of who exactly has access to data. Much research on mitigating insider threats focuses on detection. In this paper, we consider the prevention of attacks using access control and we propose (RBAC<sup>+</sup>), an extension of the NIST RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) standard with the notions of application, application profile and sub-application session.
