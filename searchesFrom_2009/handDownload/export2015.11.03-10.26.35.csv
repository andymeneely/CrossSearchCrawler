This introduces increased potential for innovation in networking from performance-enhanced to energy-efficient designs. In SDN, the application connects with the network via the SDN controller. A specific concern relating to this communication channel is whether an application can be trusted or not. For example, what information about the network state is gathered by the application? Is this information necessary for the application to execute or is it gathered for malicious intent? In this paper we present an approach to secure the northbound interface by introducing a permissions system that ensures that controller operations are available to trusted applications only. Implementation of this permissions system with our Operation Checkpoint adds negligible overhead and illustrates successful defense against unauthorized control function access attempts.","","978-1-4799-6203-7","","10.1109/ICNP.2014.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980437","","Communication networks;Java;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Switches","authorisation;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security","OperationCheckpoint;SDN application control;communication channel;energy-efficient design;performance-enhanced design;permissions system;software defined networking;unauthorized control function access attempts","","0","","15","","","21-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently the demand in tight control of the enterprise network to defense the misuse and security issues become more and more urgent. Based on the TCG TNC standard, an application level network access control mechanism is proposed and implemented. With TNC client/server model in hand, a client is designed to enhance TNC client with the function of host flow controller (HFC), and intercepts each application network access request(ANAR) and transfer it to PDP server to authorize the access request. When a sensor (i.e. intrusion detection system) detects any malicious traffic, host flow controller and network flow controller can identify the application that origins this traffic by querying Metadata Access Point (MAP) server and block this application's network access. A prototype system is implemented to demonstrate the design and can be used to defense the anomaly network behaviors. The prototype system demonstrates that the hosts, switches, firewalls and IDS can work together to detect, diagnose and protect enterprise network from the malicious applications attack initiated inside or outside of an enterprise network, quarantine unhealthy hosts and make the enterprise network more reliable and trustworthy.","","978-1-4244-5850-9","","10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541863","Access Control;Application Level Access Control;Network Security;Trusted Network Connect","Access control;Communication system traffic control;Control systems;Hybrid fiber coaxial cables;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Prototypes;Sensor systems and applications;Switches;Traffic control","","","","0","12","16","","","25-27 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present and analyze a hypothetical (but realistic) cyber crime investigation scenario. According to this, a user who has wireless internet access using a mobile phone through a University's network facilities, visits sites with pornographic content. A fact that complicates the analysis of the scenario is that the user employs anti-forensics techniques (e.g. data encryption). In this paper we show how to apply to the investigation of this scenario (as well as similar ones) a number of widely available open source forensics analysis tools overcoming the anti-forensics efforts of malicious users.

Black hole attacks are potentially devastating attacks on wireless sensor networks in which a malicious node uses spurious route updates to attract network traffic that it then drops. We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic. We examine the resource-preserving mechanisms of our system using simulations and demonstrate that we can allow groups of nodes to collectively evaluate network traffic and identify attacks while respecting the limited hardware resources (processing, memory and storage) that are typically available on wireless sensor network nodes.","","","","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835013","","Cryptography;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","autonomous self-organizing low-power nodes;black hole attacks;flexible attack detection scheme;lightweight expert system;malicious node;network traffic;node-resident expert systems;resource-preserving mechanisms;spurious route updates;watchdog mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","0","","20","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since it seems impossible to guarantee complete protection to a system by means of the ""classical"" prevention mechanisms, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems has emerged as a key element in network security. In this paper we address the problem considering some techniques for detecting network anomalies. Our approach is based on the use of different compression algorithms for detecting anomalies in the network traffic running over TCP. In more detail we take into account the use of three different compression algorithms, based on distinct approaches, namely: Huffman coding, Dynamic Markov Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. The proposed methods are based on the consideration that the entropy represents a lower bound to the compression rate that we can obtain, and that the more redundant the data are and the better we can compress them. The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199270","","Communications Society;Compression algorithms;Cryptography;Data security;Entropy;Huffman coding;Image coding;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection","Internet;Markov processes;encoding;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Huffman coding;Internet;Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm;TCP;compression algorithms;dynamic Markov coding;intrusion detection systems;network anomaly detection;network security;network traffic;security attacks","","0","","19","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection model in which we combine a newly proposed genetic based feature selection algorithm and an existing Fuzzy Support Vector Machines (SVM) for effective classification as a solution. The feature selection reduces the number of features by removing unimportant features, hence reducing runtime. Moreover, when the Fuzzy SVM classifier is used with the reduced feature set, it improves the detection accuracy.

We propose an adaptive model to learn majority patterns under a dynamic changing environment. We first propose unsupervised learning on data abstraction to extract essential features of samples. We then adopt incremental majority learning with iterative evolutions on fitting envelopes to characterize the majority of samples within moving windows. A network traffic sample is considered an anomaly if its abstract feature falls on the outside of the fitting envelope. We justify the effectiveness of the presented approach against 150000+ traffic samples from the NSL-KDD dataset in training and testing, demonstrating positive promise in detecting network attacks by identifying samples that have abnormal features.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280573","incremental learning;intrusion detection system;neural networks;outlier detection","Adaptation models;Character recognition;Classification algorithms;Testing","computer network security;data structures;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","NSL-KDD dataset;abnormal features;anomaly behavior;data abstraction;dynamic changing environment;fitting envelopes;incremental majority learning;intrusion detection systems;iterative evolutions;large network traffic data;network attacks;network-traffic anomaly detection;unsupervised learning","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This dependence of modern societies on the Internet has also resulted in more criminals using the Internet for their purposes, causing a steady increase of attacks, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible. To overcome this shortcoming we present a new behavior-based detection architecture that uses similarity measurements to detect intrusions as well as insider activities like data exfiltration in encrypted environments.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6852093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6852093","","Encryption;Internet;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Payloads;Telecommunication network management","Internet;computer network security;cryptography","Internet;behavior-based intrusion detection;data exfiltration;encrypted communication;encrypted environments;malicious activity detection","","0","","","","","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite many of these machine learning approaches have achieved the goal of getting high accuracy levels in a more automatic way, the fact is that only a few of them have actually been deployed on real life scenarios. This could be explained if we take into consideration that some of the assumptions in which these techniques rely on, do not easily hold. Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels.

Virtualization has a key role in supporting the IaaS model. However, virtualization also makes it a target for potent rootkits because of the loss of control problem over the hosted Virtual Machines (VMs). This makes traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operating system kernel trustworthiness, no longer an effective solution to secure the virtual infrastructure of the IaaS model. In this paper, we explore briefly the security problem of the IaaS cloud computing model, and present CloudSec, a new virtualization-aware monitoring appliance that provides active, transparent and real-time security monitoring for hosted VMs in the IaaS model. CloudSec utilizes virtual machine introspection techniques to provide fine-grained inspection of VM's physical memory without installing any monitoring code inside the VM. It actively reconstructs and monitors the dynamically changing kernel data structures instances, as a prior step to enable providing protection for kernel data structures. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype using VMsafe libraries on a VMware ESX platform. We have evaluated the system monitoring accuracy and the performance overhead of CloudSec.","","978-1-4577-0458-1","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059967","Cloud Computing;IaaS Security;Semantic Gap;VMsafe APIs;VMware ESX;Virtual Appliance;Virtual Machine Introspection","Data structures;Kernel;Memory management;Monitoring;Security;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;data structures;operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","CloudSec;VM physical memory;VMsafe libraries;VMware ESX platform;fine grained inspection;in-guest security solutions;infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing model;kernel data structures;operating system kernel trustworthiness;security monitoring appliance;virtual machine introspection techniques;virtualization;virtualization aware monitoring appliance","","10","","27","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper details a Human Interface for Security Awareness (HISA) algorithm for interpreting cyber incident information to human operators from anomaly based intrusion detections systems. A similarity algorithm mapping anomaly results to signature based intrusion system rules is developed. Categorizations of attacks found in rules created for the Snort intrusion system were used as a basis of information to present to the user.

The transmittance contrast between the x- and y-polarized modes reaches 31.9 dB, which is sensitive enough to monitor any polarization state change in the fiber.

Now-a-days intrusion detection systems play an important role in security infrastructures. Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. The host based systems as well as the network based systems have their own limitations. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present NIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces some significant problems contained by the previous systems such as trust issues and message spreading problems. In the proposed IDS we donpsilat need to install the system for every host. That reduces the system overhead to a reasonable extent.

Due to its architecture, it suffers from various types of denial of service attacks like collision attacks, packet dropping and misdirection. Denial of Service attacks affects the availability of network and prevents legal nodes to use the network services.

In wireless image sensor networks, some monitoring quality loss may be tolerated since visual information retrieved from source nodes may have different relevance for the application, according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors' poses and fields of view. Based on such sensing relevancies, we propose an energy-efficient visual monitoring mechanism where the frequency of image snapshots transmitted by each source node will be a function of the monitoring relevance of the node for the application. Doing so, we achieve energy saving over the active paths as lower relevant source nodes will transmit fewer images in a period of time, but with low impact to the monitoring functions of the application since sufficient information is still received from the most relevant source nodes. We simulated different communication scenarios to show the expected energy saving when the proposed solution is employed.","","978-1-4577-1724-6","","10.1109/SAS.2012.6166274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6166274","Energy-Efficient Monitoring;Sensing Relevance;Wireless Image Sensor Networks","Energy consumption;Image sensors;Monitoring;Sensors;Visualization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;image sensors;wireless sensor networks","energy efficient;image snapshots;image transmissions;sensing relevancies;source nodes;visual monitoring;wireless image sensor networks","","2","","16","","","7-9 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.","","978-1-4244-4422-9","978-1-4244-4421-2","10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307","","Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics)","Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game","","21","2","28","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level.

Recently, data mining techniques have gained importance in providing the valuable information which in turn can help to enhance the decision on identifying the intrusions (attacks). In this paper; we evaluate the performance of various rule based classifiers like: JRip, RIDOR, NNge and decision table using ensemble approach in order to build an efficient network intrusion detection system. We use KDDCup'99, intrusion detection benchmark dataset (which is a part of DARPA evaluation program) for our experimentation.

In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed.

Unfortunately, the amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Several feature selection and feature extraction techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of data. Few are focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the finding of that finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. A new hybrid algorithm MID-PCA combining PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance - MID evaluation criteria) is proposed. PCA is first applied to the original dataset. Then, mRMR-MID is applied to the intermediary output to further reduce redundancy and maximize relevancy. An exhaustive evaluation of the MID-PCA algorithm is conducted with the KDD Cup'99, a used widely dataset in the network security community. MID-PCA performance was compared to that of PCA and mRMR using two classifiers namely J48 (C4.5) and BayesNet. Experimental results assert the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm MID-PCA for NIDS feature extraction compared with PCA and Mutual Information. The newly proposed MID-PCA shows better performance and classification accuracies with reduced datasets of only 4 dimensions for BayesNet (99.77%) and 6 dimensions for J48 (99.94%). This is an improvement over PCA which achieves similar classification accuracy with 12 principal components (twelve dimensions). An extension of this paper will conduct broader experiments using other datasets, then compare results to that of several well known feature reduction algorithms to confirm the superiority of MID-PCA.","","978-1-4673-2276-8","","10.1109/IS.2012.6335176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335176","Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Mutual Information;Principal Component Analysis","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Principal component analysis","Internet;computer network security;data analysis;feature extraction;pattern classification;principal component analysis;redundancy;telecommunication traffic","BayesNet classifier comparison;Internet traffic monitoring;J48 classifier comparison;KDD Cup'99;MID evaluation criteria;MID-PCA hybrid algorithm;NIDS;classification accuracy;data size reduction;feature extraction technique;feature selection technique;mRMR;malicious activity detection;minimum redundancy maximum relevance;mutual information;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;redundancy reduction;relevancy maximization","","0","","31","","","6-8 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a distributed clustering algorithm based on the group mobility and a revised group mobility metric which is derived from the instantaneous speed and direction of nodes. Our dynamic, distributed clustering approach use Gauss Markov group mobility model for mobility prediction that enables each node to anticipate its mobility relative to its neighbors. In particular, it is suitable for reflecting group mobility pattern where group partitions and mergence are prevalent behaviors of mobile groups. We also take the residual energy of nodes and the number of neighbor nodes into consideration. The proposed clustering scheme aims to form stable clusters by reducing the clustering iterations even in a highly dynamic environment. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed framework is superior to two well-known clustering approaches, the MOBIC and DGMA, in terms of average number of clusterhead changes.","","","","10.1109/APNOMS.2015.7275358","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275358","MANETs;clustering algorithm;group mobility model;node mobility","Clustering algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","Gaussian processes;Markov processes;iterative methods;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern clustering","DGMA;Gauss Markov group mobility model;MANET;MOBIC;distributed clustering algorithm;group mobility based clustering algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;mobility prediction","","","","","","","19-21 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When using a real-time operating system, the executing process changes several times each second, requiring fast adaptation on the part of the intrusion detection mechanism. We present a technique to exploit the partial runtime reconfiguration feature present on many modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to adapt intrusion detection to a new process at each context switch.

Besides simplifying our daily lives, the MTC business represents a promising market for mobile operators to increase their revenues. However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks. Finally, a real-life implementation of LightEPC on top of cloud platform is discussed.","2169-3536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2359649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906244","Carrier cloud;Machine type communications (MTC);mobile cloud networking;network function virtualization (NFV)","Logic gates;Machine-to-machine communications;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Object recognition;Protocols;Radio access networks;Servers","3G mobile communication;cloud computing;mobile computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","3GPP;LightEPC framework;MTC;NFV;cloud computing;cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks;machine type communications;network function virtualization;network node failures","","3","","27","","2014-09-22","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731","Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine","Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput","deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching","ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching","","1","","30","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Even if a lot of research was already done on this topic, the perfect IDS has still not been found and it stays a hot and challenging area in computer security research. This paper presents a simple and robust method for intrusion detection in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA) where each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is then employed to reduce the high dimensional data vectors and thus, detection is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. Our experiments with the KDD Cup 99 dataset, although not yet completed, have shown that this approach is promising in terms of detection accuracy. It is also effective to identify most known attacks as well as new attacks. However, a frequent update for both user profiles and attacks databases is crucial to improve the identification rates.","","978-1-4244-6520-0","978-9948-427-14-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542663","Anomaly Detection;Intrusion Detection;Misuse Detection;Principal Component Analysis;User Behavior","Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Robustness;US Government","computer network security;principal component analysis","KDD Cup 99 dataset;computer networks;data vectors;information technology company;intrusion detection systems;misuse detection;principal component analysis;security systems;sensitive systems","","1","","16","","","March 30 2010-April 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

File is an important carrier of information, which is the intent of quite a number of attackers, in this paper, we propose an FPD-based approach for detecting abnormal file access behaviours. FPD (File Path Diversity) is a quantized value which measures how far a set of file paths is spread out, and in which abnormal file access behaviours and normal ones show significant differences, making it an effective indicator for detecting malicious processes that controlled by attackers to search and steal valuable files. An algorithm of calculating FPD values is presented, as well as a prototype system based on FPD for detecting malicious processes. Experiments demonstrate that FPD is very effective in detecting malicious processes with abnormal file access behaviours, we get a best result of a100% Detection Rate and a 3.85% False Positive Rate.","","","","10.1049/cp.2014.0632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6913685","Information security;abnormal file access behaviours;anomaly detection;file path diversity","","","","","0","","","","","15-17 May 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In this paper, a mobile backbone network of trusted nodes is proposed to enhance AODV security with minimum overhead. The proposed backbone network does not violate the MANET mobility characteristic. It is constructed from randomly moving regular MANET nodes based on their trust value, location, and power. The backbone network monitors regular nodes as well as each other to periodically estimate monitoring trust values which represent the reliability of each node in the network.

The proposed scheme loads two hash functions and an initial key into the base station, cluster heads, and sensor nodes. Every node including the cluster heads and sensor node authenticates its neighbor nodes with the initial key. Then every node establishes pair wise key with each of its neighbor node to ensure transmission secrecy. The pair wise keys are updated between node and its neighbors within a random interval time, which is triggered by the base station. The security of this scheme is analyzed and it shows that it is robust to the guessing attacks, replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and node capture attacks.

Evolutionary approaches play an important role in identifying attacks with high detection rates and low false discovery rates. In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. Multi-objective PSO approach is used for feature selection from a set of 41 features and Random Forests (RF), a highly accurate and fast algorithm, is used for classification.

To address the above issue, a two-step feature selection algorithm is proposed in this paper. Depending on the definition of relevant feature and redundant feature and using mutual information as criterion, it firstly eliminates the irrelevant features and then eliminates the redundant features. With low time complexity, the feature selection algorithm independent of detection algorithm could easily balance the detection accuracy and the number of features through threshold. Experiments over networks connection records from authoritative data set KDD CUP 1999 were implemented for several detection algorithms to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the algorithm could effectively select features, ensure detection accuracy and improve processing speed.","","978-0-7695-3615-6","","10.1109/JCAI.2009.214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159080","feature selection;intrusion detection;mutual information","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Computer vision;Data engineering;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Mutual information;Software algorithms;Training data","computational complexity;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis","KDD;authoritative data set;intrusion detection;machine learning;mutual information;network connection record;statistical analysis;time complexity;two-step feature selection algorithm","","2","","9","","","25-26 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The field has become interesting and problems look even more exciting to solve ever since organizations have been trying to tame large volumes of complex and fast arriving Big Data streams through newer computing paradigms. However, extracting meaningful and actionable information from Big Data is a challenging and daunting task. The ability to generate value from large volumes of data is an art which combined with analytical skills needs to be mastered in order to gain competitive advantage in business. The ability of organizations to leverage the emerging technologies and integrate Big Data into their enterprise architectures effectively depends on the maturity level of the technology and business teams, capabilities they develop as well as the strategies they adopt. In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists. Deriving information from Big Data is also subject to challenges associated with data security and privacy. These and other challenges are discussed in context of the selected problems to illustrate the potential of Big Data analytics.","","","","10.1109/BigDataService.2015.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7184914","algorithms;big data;machine learning;review","Algorithm design and analysis;Big data;Companies;Machine learning algorithms;Security;Sentiment analysis","Big Data;business data processing;data integration;data mining;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;statistical analysis;text analysis","Big Data integration;Big Data streams;analytical skills;analytical techniques;business benehts;business teams;business value;computing paradigms;data privacy;data security;enterprise architectures;information extraction;large-data volumes;machine learning algorithm;maturity level;one-size-hts-all solution;online commerce;optimization algorithm;security improvement;smart utility meters;social media;statistical analysis;telecommunication industry;text mining algorithm","","0","","76","","","March 30 2015-April 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field. The experiment results show that the proposed model has significantly improved the binary text classification performance in both F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy compared with three other influential baseline models.","","","","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058104","Centroid optimization;Centroid vector;Multi-learning;Text classification;clustering","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Optimization;Testing;Training;Uncertainty;Vectors","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","RCV1;Reuters Corpus Volume 1;binary classification;binary text classification performance;centroid clustering;centroid training;data mining;influential baseline models;iterative multilearning process;machine learning;model CTTC;principal centroid vectors;standard dataset;text classification technology;training process;uncertain decision boundary BND;uncertainty boundary","","0","","20","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such architecture leverages the principle of separation of concerns, and hence proposes to build up a system comprising entities specialized in performing different tasks, appropriately orchestrated by a broker entity playing the crucial role of the mediator. This paper stresses the point that a distributed system, besides being inherently more scalable than a centralized one, allows for better detection capabilities thanks to the effective exploitation of the inner heterogeneity of the involved detection engines.

However, WSNs have limited energy resources that hinder the dissemination of the raw data over the network to a central location. This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system. Our model is capable of tracking changes in the data distribution in the monitored environment. We illustrate the proposed algorithm with numerical results on both real-life and simulated data sets, which demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach compared to existing methods.","1550-4786","978-1-4577-2075-8","","10.1109/ICDM.2011.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137251","Anomaly Detection;IDCAD;Incremental Elliptical Boundary Estimation;Streaming Data Analysis","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Covariance matrix;Data models;Sensors;Training;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;security of data;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;batch training;data mining approaches;data modeling approaches;fixed offline training period;incremental elliptical boundary estimation;spatially dense data;wireless sensor networks","","7","","27","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
