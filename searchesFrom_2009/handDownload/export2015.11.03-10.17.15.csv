Unlike papers discussing the challenges and opportunities presented by cloud computing in relation to digital forensics, in this paper, we will discuss the underpinning cloud computing elements which are required to provide forensics friendly cloud services.

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231","Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks","Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks","","35","","52","","2010-06-10","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Consequently, effective Cyber Defence will be more and more important. In this paper we will show that the proposed requirements for an Early Warning System are a main part of future Cyber Defence. Special attention is given on the challenges associated to the generation of early warning systems for future attacks on the Internet of the Future. The term Cyber War is used frequently but unfortunately with different intends. Therefore, we start with a definition of the term Cyber War focusing on security aspects related to the Internet of the Future, followed by an exemplification of a Cyber War, of its implications and the challenges associated to it. Then we proceed with an analysis of state of the art recent work that has been proposed on the topic. Additionally the weaknesses of these analyzed systems and approaches are presented.

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades.

This paper presents an intelligent control system based on artificial immune system architecture to maintain the thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. Specifically, a residential building is regarded as a human body and a comfortable thermal environment means the healthy state of body. Whenever outside factors disturb this state, which is analogous to the intrusion of pathogens, the immune system will work automatically to eliminate them and therefore to keep the proper state of the body.

But the properties of constrained resources make WSNs vulnerable to different types of intrusions such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks which result in a large number of compromised nodes. For success application of ubiquitous WSN it is important to maintain the basic security. However, there is not an effective intrusion detection and self-recovery system to eliminate the harm of DoS attacks. To solve the problem, an agent-based intrusion detection and self-recovery system for WSNs is proposed, which adopts the distributed architecture to monitor intrusion activities and realize abnormal events processing in local nodes. Finally, the system is analyzed and verified.

Finding digital evidence in VoIP malicious attacks is the most difficult task, due to its associated features with converged network. In this paper, a Model of investigating VoIP malicious attacks is proposed for forensic analysis. The model formalizes hypotheses through information gathering and adopt a Secure Temporal Logic of Action(S-TLA+) in the process of reconstructing potential attack scenario. Through this processes, investigators can uncover unknown attack scenario executed in the process of attack. Subsequently, it is expected that the findings of this paper will provide clear description of attacks as well as generation of more specified evidences.","","978-1-4673-1425-1","","10.1109/CyberSec.2012.6246116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246116","Evidence Generation;Investigation;Malicious attack;S-TLA+;SIP;Scenario Fragment;Voice over IP","Computational modeling;Digital forensics;Internet telephony;Protocols;Security;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet telephony;computer forensics;computer network security;temporal logic","S-TLA+;VoIP evidence model;VoIP malicious attacks;Voice over Internet protocol;digital evidence;digital forensic investigators;forensic analysis;forensic method;information gathering;potential attack scenario reconstruction;secure temporal logic of action;security threats","","0","","19","","","26-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, modern DoS attacks that blend normal and malicious network traffic, significantly increase the rate of false alarms, hence challenge the effectiveness of IDS. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy IDS to address the uncertainty problem in distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic. The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. Comparing to other related works, our system exhibited a detection rate of 99.91%,while only produced around 1600 false alarms in more than 5 million test sessions, against DoS flooding attacks, where just a reduced number of features employed.","","978-1-4799-5658-6","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030332","Classification;Denial of Service;Fuzzy Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Taxonomy","Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network security;decision trees;fuzzy set theory;telecommunication traffic","DoS flooding attacks;KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;attacks categorization;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision-tree structure;expert knowledge;fuzzy IDS;fuzzy detection engine;fuzzy intrusion detection system;machine intelligence;malicious network traffic;misuse patterns;modern DoS attacks;network environments;normal network traffic;uncertainty problem","","0","","18","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DNP3 over TCP/IP is among those protocols that are widely used as communication and control protocols in critical infrastructures. Due to the facts that security was not part of the goals for designing the DNP3 and the incompetent of current protection systems, adversary can easily succeed in attacking DNP3 devices and network. In this paper, we present an Autonomic Network Protection Framework for DNP3 over TCP/IP that detects old attacks that cannot be prevented by the legacy DNP3 security devices as well as new attacks. The system's detection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection. We evaluated the effectiveness of the generated rules in detecting anomalies through both offline and online testing. Both the false positive and the false negative rates of our approach are quite low.

We demonstrate that high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using Conditional Random Fields and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach. Experimental results on the benchmark KDD '99 intrusion data set show that our proposed system based on Layered Conditional Random Fields outperforms other well-known methods such as the decision trees and the naive Bayes. The improvement in attack detection accuracy is very high, particularly, for the U2R attacks (34.8 percent improvement) and the R2L attacks (34.5 percent improvement).

ID always generates huge data sets; such raw data sets are incapable of being training due to its large scale and high dimension and redundancy. Intrusion detection system always has the disadvantages such as over-loaded, occupying too much resource, an extension of training and forecasting time... therefore, the simplification of practical information becomes such a necessity. Recursive support vector machine (R-SVM) and Rough set were used for exacting main features of raw data, and many kinds of classification algorithms were used here and it has been tested by KDDCUP1999 date set. The result shows that, the SVM classification based on R-SVM runs excellent, its accuracy is as good as the SVM classification based on the whole features and considerably reduces the training and testing time.","","978-1-4673-1331-5","","10.1109/ICADE.2012.6330103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6330103","R-SVM;classification;feature extraction;intrusion detection system;simplification of pratical information","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Redundancy;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","feature extraction;pattern classification;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","ID;KDDCUP1999 date set;R-SVM;classification algorithms;feature extraction;intrude detecting;intrusion detection system;network security issues;recursive support vector machine;rough set","","0","","11","","","27-29 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our approach we consider that a nervous system design and organization is a constructive process carried out by genetic information encoded in DNA. Our NEA evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a Lindenmayer System with memory that implements the principles of organization, modularity, repetition (multiple use of the same sub-structure), hierarchy (recursive composition of sub-structures), as a metaphor for development of neurons and its connections. In our method, this basic neural codification is integrated to a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that implements the constructive approach found in the evolutionary process, making it closest to the biological ones. Our method was initially tested on a simple, but non-trivial, XOR problem. We also submit our method to two other problems of increasing complexity: Prediction of the effect of a new drug on Breast Cancer and KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Some advantages of the proposed methodology are that it increases the level of implicit parallelism of the GA and seems to be capable of generating minimal satisfactory neural architectures, resulting in a reduction of project costs and increasing the performance of the evolved ANN, suggesting a promising potential for future applications.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280535","","Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;Genomics;Legged locomotion;RNA","DNA;genetic algorithms;neural net architecture;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","ANN;DNA;KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset;L-system;Lindenmayer System;NEA;artificial neural networks;biologically inspired neuroevolutive algorithm;breast cancer drug;constructive process;evolutionary computation;evolutionary process;genetic algorithm;genetic information encoding;hierarchical neural structures;minimal satisfactory neural architectures;modular neural structures;nervous system design;neural codification;nontrivial XOR problem;project cost reduction;recurrent neural structures;recursive substructure composition","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The consistency and sufficiency of both factors X Y, demonstrated using the Information Theory, can explain the risk of a dynamic system. However, going deep into their meaning, the Theory of Calculability should ensure its validity in the design of self-protected networks and dynamic systems.

Existing blacklisting techniques have focused on the most prolific attack sources and, more recently, on collaborative blacklisting. In this paper, we formulate the problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as ""predictive blacklisting"") based on shared attack logs, as an implicit recommendation system. We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for prediction and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement. Inspired by the recent NetFlix competition, we propose a multi-level collaborative filtering model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting problem. Our model captures and combines various factors namely: attacker-victim history (using time-series) and attackers and/or victims interactions (using neighborhood models).

The incremental mining approach makes the system suitable for detecting, and thus, responding to an attack in real-time.

The traditional approaches of securing routing protocols can not address such insider attacks in DTNs. In this paper, we propose a method to secure the history records of packet delivery information at each contact so that other nodes can detect insider attacks by analyzing these packet delivery records.

"Decompression-free inspection: DPI for shared dictionary compression over HTTP","Bremler-Barr, A.; David, S.T.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Interdiscipl. Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE","20120510","2012","","","1987","1995","Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576","","Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers","Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols","Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression","","2","","25","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4577-1704-8","978-1-4577-1702-4","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","11","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many ways outdoor security sensor technology can be described as “Slow-Tech” in a “High-Tech” world. In “High-Tech” we can expect a new product every few months with product lifetimes of one to two years. In the “Slow-Tech” world of outdoor security it typically takes two to three years to develop a new product and another two to three years to get the product approved by the user community. Fortunately once approved these products have a lifetime of ten to twenty years. The Carnahan Conference has provided an important venue for the introduction of new sensor technologies as they emerge from R&D, are tested by various agencies, and are introduced into the “real world” of outdoor security. The harsh realities of the outdoor environment and the wide range of threats faced by these sensors provide many challenges that have been the topic of many of the learned papers. The Carnahan conference provides an opportunity for the users of the technology to relate their experience to those who wish to introduce new technologies. Through the sponsorship of the IEEE these papers form a unique point of reference for the development of new sensors. Forty years ago most of the important players were large aerospace companies. Many of the sensor technologies used in perimeter security evolved from military developments. As one of the dominant users of perimeter security equipment, the US military sponsored much of this early development. This “mil-spec” environment had a profound effect on these developments which in many cases has survived to this day and is part of the heritage of the present world on outdoor perimeter security. These companies gave way to a number of small “spin-off” one product co- panies where the technologies were exploited. More recently most of one product companies have merged into larger “one-stop-shopping” companies. This paper describes the many changes in technology, the business models and the user community over the past 40 years and concludes with a prediction as to what the next 10 years will bring.","1071-6572","978-1-4673-2450-2","978-1-4673-2449-6","10.1109/CCST.2012.6393530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393530","","Companies;Government;Industries;Military aircraft;Security;Sensor systems","military equipment;national security;sensors","Carnahan Conference;IEEE sponsorship;US military;VIP residents;aerospace companies;business models;critical assets;forty year perspective;high-tech world;mil-spec environment;military developments;one-stop-shopping companies;outdoor environment;outdoor perimeter security sensors;perimeter security equipment;sensor technology;slow-tech world;threats;user community","","0","","13","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proper scheduling policies can improve system capability without requiring additional resources. LAS, a size-based scheduling policy which can achieve optimal mean response time by giving preferential analysis to short flows, is widely used in various aspects of network field. Due to the high variability property of Internet traffic, LAS favors short flows without penalizing large flows very much. Unfortunately, the inspection of large flows can not be guaranteed in those network intrusion detection systems on 10Gbps links, which are usually heavily loaded, or even overloaded. Although tiny in percentage, large flows comprise more than 50% of the total load, and therefore can not be ignored, especially when specified by users as critical. How to avoid starving large flows while still giving higher priority to short flows is a dilemma we have to face in practice. In this paper, we propose a QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy (QTL), which can remedy LAS' defect.

In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers. The obtained results demonstrated that naive bayes classifier has better classification accuracy in the case of lower presented attacks such as U2R and R2L, while the J48 decision tree classifier gives high accuracy up to 82% for DoS attacks and 65.4% for probe attacks in the anomaly traffic.","","978-1-4799-2438-7","","10.1109/HIS.2013.6920485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920485","Artificial Immune System;Intrusion Classification;Machine Learning;Network Intrusion Detection","Niobium;Probes","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;principal component analysis;telecommunication traffic","DoS attacks;IDS;J48 decision tree classifier;NSL-KDD benchmark data set;PCA algorithm;R2L;U2R;anomalies detection;anomalous traffic;anomaly detectors;classification approach;feature selection;genetic algorithm;immune systems;multilayer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron neural network;naive Bayes classifier;negative selection approach;normal traffic;principal component analysis algorithm;probe attacks","","1","","25","","","4-6 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a hybrid approach based on the Adaptive Intelligent Intrusion Detector Agent (AIIDA-SQL) for the detection of those attacks. The AIIDA-SQL agent incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) engine which is equipped with learning and adaptation capabilities for the classification of SQL queries and detection of malicious user requests. To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle. This strategy enables to classify the received SQL queries in a reliable way. Finally, a projection neural technique is incorporated, which notably eases the revision stage carried out by human experts in the case of suspicious queries. The experimental results obtained on a real-traffic case study show that AIIDA-SQL performs remarkably well in practice.","","978-1-4244-7363-2","","10.1109/HIS.2010.5600026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5600026","Agent;Artificial Neural Network;Case-Based Reasoning;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection;Support Vector Machine","Artificial neural networks;Book reviews;Classification algorithms;Cognition;Databases;Humans;Support vector machines","SQL;case-based reasoning;neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","AIIDA-SQL agent;CBR engine;SQL injection attack detecting;SQL queries classification;adaptive intelligent intrusion detector agent;artificial neuronal network;case-based reasoning engine;information security;malicious user requests detection;projection neural technique;support vector machine;web applications","","1","","18","","","23-25 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Single sign on (SSO) provides a convenient facility for managing user authentication such that a user only logs into a system once in order to gain access to many protected applications. For this reason it becomes vitally important to secure the SSO server. If an SSO server is compromised, it could potentially put many applications at risk at the same time. The current Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems have proven to be inadequate because the “bad guys” are always one step ahead. In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to SSO server security called “Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance SSO” (SCIT). SCIT shifts the focus from detection and prevention to containing losses, by reducing the exposure time of the servers. Specifically, we present the results of an evaluation of the performance of a SCIT-ized SSO server. In this way we increase the dependability of the server and provide a new way to balance the trade-off between security and availability. We will show that SCIT provides increased security with little degradation in overall response time of the system.","","978-1-4244-7530-8","","10.1109/DEPEND.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562840","SCIT;central authentication service;exposure time;persistence;pro-active;response time;single sign on;virtualization;vmware","Authentication;Browsers;Degradation;Servers;Time factors;Virtual machining","message authentication","IT systems;SSO server;distributed systems;intrusion detection;prevention systems;self cleansing intrusion tolerance SSO;server dependability;single sign on server protection;user authentication","","1","","16","","","18-25 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect and reduce those misbehaviors, numerous trust management schemes have been proposed for MANETs. To effectively set up MANET, security is one of the main challenges that must be undertaken. The weight based clustering approach is based on combined weight metric that takes into account of several system parameters like the mobility, degree difference, transmission range and battery power of the node. One way to support efficient communication between nodes is to partition ad hoc networks into clusters. Various clustering schemes have been proposed to form clusters.

Therefore, the features selection is an important issue in intrusion detection. Reducing the features set improves the system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing phases considerably. In this paper, we improve the Enhancing Support Vector Decision Function (ESVDF) approach by integrate it with a fuzzy inferencing model. The fuzzy inferencing model is used to accommodate the learning approximation and the small differences in the decision making steps of the ESVDF approach. It simplifies the design complexity and reduces the execution time of the ESVDF, which speeds up the features selection processing and facilitates any modification or changes in the features selection process that may happen later. In addition, it improves the overall performance of the ESVDF. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can deliver a satisfactory performance in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing time.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-4000-9","978-0-7695-3638-5","10.1109/AINA.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076245","","Computer networks;Computer vision;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","approximation theory;decision making;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","decision making;enhancing support vector decision function;feature set reduction;features selection;fuzzy ESVDF approach;fuzzy inference model;intrusion detection system;machine learning approximation;testing phase;training phase","","3","","28","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To train and analyze detection mechanisms, researchers typically simulate the DDoS traffic in the testbed; while for Flash Crowds, most researchers replay the web server captures obtained from third parties. This paper proposes the design of a special testbed-based simulation method with Spirent Test Center hardware platform, to simulate both DDoS traffic and Flash Crowds traffic.

Each component is either in a healthy state or an abnormal state. To model scenarios where attacks to the network may not follow a stochastic process and the attackers may adapt to the actions of the intrusion detection system (IDS) in an arbitrary and unknown way, we adopt a non-stochastic model in which the attack process at each component can be any unknown deterministic sequence. Due to resource constraints, the IDS can only choose K (K <; N) components to probe at each time. An abnormal component incurs a cost per unit time (depending on the criticality of the component) until it is probed and fixed. The objective is a dynamic probing strategy under the performance measure of regret, defined as the performance loss compared to that of a genie who knows the entire attack processes a priori and probes optimally (under certain constraints) based on this knowledge. We propose a policy that achieves sublinear regret order, thus offers the same time averaged performance as that of the omniscient genie.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654814","Intrusion detection;dynamic probing;non-stochastic multi-armed bandit;regret","Dynamic scheduling;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Probes;Stochastic processes;Switches","security of data;stochastic processes","IDS;attack process;cyber network;dynamic probing;intrusion detection system;resource constraints;stochastic model;stochastic process","","0","","14","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using vital sign monitor medical devices as an example, we demonstrate that our intrusion detection technique can effectively trade false positives off for a high detection probability to cope with more sophisticated and hidden attackers to support ultra safe and secure MCPS applications.

The key concept of our redundancy management is to exploit the tradeoff between energy consumption vs. the gain in reliability, timeliness, and security to maximize the system useful lifetime. We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized. We then apply the analysis results obtained to the design of a dynamic redundancy management algorithm to identify and apply the best design parameter settings at runtime in response to environment changes, to maximize the HWSN lifetime.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.043013.120282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514999","Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;intrusion detection;multipath routing;reliability;security","Energy conservation;Intrusion detection;Multipath channels;Network sensors;Routing protocls;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor management","energy consumption;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","HWSN;dynamic redundancy management algorithm;energy consumption;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intrusion tolerance;multipath routing;optimization problem;query response success probability;security;voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm","","4","","40","","2013-05-13","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But along with the innumerable benefits of Internet, a number of serious issues have also taken birth regarding data security, system security and user privacy. A numbers of intruders attempt to gain unauthorized access into computer network. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a stronger strategy to provide security. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient IDS by selecting relevant futures from NSL-KDD dataset and using Logistic Regression (LR) based classifier. To decrease memory space and learning time, a feature selection method is required. In this paper we have selected a number of feature sets, using the approach of Genetic Algorithm (GA), with our proposed fitness score based on Mutual Correlation. From the number of feature sets, we have selected the fittest set of features using our proposed Best Feature Set Selection (BFSS) method. After selecting the most relevant features from NSL-KDD data set, we used LR based classification. Thus, an efficient IDS is created by applying the concept of GA with BFSS for feature selection and LR for classification to detect network intrusions.","","978-1-4799-4446-0","","10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060117","BFSS;GA;Gradient Descent;IDS;LR;Mutual Correlation;NSL-KDD","Biological cells;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Sociology;Statistics;Training","feature selection;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;regression analysis;security of data","BFSS;GA;IDS;LR classifier;best feature set selection method;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system;logistic regression;mutual correlation","","0","","19","","","7-8 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of features is produced projecting statistical texture properties of the images, using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCMs). Edge detection is applied, histograms of images after edge detection are produced and used as second and third set of features with 40 and 30 bins respectively. Eighty percent of examples from each; good and bad category, are used for training purposes and rest are used as test data. Logistic Regression with gradient descent algorithm is used as classifier. Results are calculated as classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

In addition, traffic is getting more concentrated to points such as data centers, and demand for protecting such high-speed networks from attack traffic is increasing. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with Regular Expression (RegEx) detection is the de facto defense mechanism agains network intrusions. However, current RegEx detection systems cannot keep up with the upcoming high-speed line rate. The RegExes consist of three types of components, exact strings, character classes (CC), and repetitions. Exact string and repetition matching have been widely studied by RegEx research community for better performance. Yet, although more than 55% of RegExes in Snort signature set contain at least one CC, hardware based solutions that focus on CC detection is limited. In this paper we propose a new CC detection architecture called Range Hash that is suitable for high-speed, compact CC detection. Additionally, we propose a practical application of the Range Hash architecture where it can be used as a pre-filter for a Regular Expression detection system to increase overall RegEx detection performance. Based on our hardware prototype design which runs at 250MHz, Range Hash can reach to 100-Gbps CC detection throughput with today's FPGA chips.","","978-1-4244-9127-8","978-1-4503-0379-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623834","Deep Packet Inspection;FPGA;Network Intrusion Detection System;Pre-Filter;Range Hash;Range Matching;Regular Expressions","Complexity theory;Computer aided manufacturing;Data structures;Detectors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Throughput","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","FPGA chips;Internet carriers;Internet traffic demands;Snort signature;character classes;data centers;deep packet inspection;exact strings;high-speed backbone network testing;network intrusions;range hash architecture;regular expression detection;regular expression prefiltering;repetition matching","","2","","45","","","25-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DBSCAN needs less knowledge of input parameters. Major advantage of DBSCAN is to identify arbitrary shape objects and removal of noise during the clustering process. Beside its familiarity, DBSCAN has problems with handling large databases and in worst case its complexity reaches to O(n<sup>2</sup>). Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities. We define criteria and analyse these variations with complexity (time and space) and output to the original DBSCAN algorithm. We also compare these variations with one another to select the efficient algorithm. In most of the variations partitioning and hybrid methodologies are originated to deal DBSCAN problems. We concluded with some variations which perform better than other variation over defined criteria (objectives).","","978-1-4244-8001-2","","10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625720","Clustering;DBSCAN;Data Mining","Clustering algorithms;Complexity theory;Lead;Noise;Partitioning algorithms;Prototypes;Spatial databases","computational complexity;noise;pattern clustering;visual databases","DBSCAN variation;noise removal;spatial database clustering","","2","","37","","","14-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a need to develop intrusion detection techniques to deal with different types of attacks in virtual domains. In this paper we consider the design choices for attack detection and propose intrusion detection architecture to deal with attacks in virtual domains. Our architecture takes into account the specific features of the virtual machine as well as security policies of the virtual domains to deal with different types of attacks in virtual machines.
