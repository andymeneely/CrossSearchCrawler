This has potential application to reducing human-animal conflicts in the vicinity of a wildlife park. The system takes on the form of a sensor-tower platform (STP) and was developed in-house. It employs a sensor array that endows the platform with a spatial-resolution capability. Given the difficulty of collecting data involving animal motion, a simulation tool was created with the aid of Blender and OpenGL software that is capable of quickly generating streams of human and animal-intrusion data. The generated data was then examined to identify a suitable collection of features that are useful in classification. The features selected corresponded to parameters that model the received signal as the super-imposition of a fixed number of chirplets, an energy signature and a cross-correlation parameter. The resultant feature vector was then passed on to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. This approach to classification was validated by making use of real-world data collected by the STP which showed both STP design as well as classification technique employed to be quite effective. The average classification accuracy with both real and simulated data was in excess of 94%.","","978-1-4799-8054-3","","10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106914","Wireless sensor network;animation;chirplets;intrusion detection;passive infrared sensor;sensor array","Animals;Arrays;Chirp;Clutter;Sensors","computer animation;feature extraction;forestry;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;support vector machines","Blender and OpenGL software;PIR sensing based intrusion detection system;STP design;SVM;animal intrusions;animation-and-chirplet based approach;cross-correlation parameter;energy signature;feature vector;human intrusions;human-animal conflicts;intruder classification;passive infrared sensing based intrusion detection system;sensor-tower platform;spatial-resolution capability;support vector machine;vegetative clutter;wildlife park","","0","","13","","","7-9 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its large memory footprint, a large-dictionary AC-DFA can experience poor cache performance when matching against inputs with high match ratio on multicore processors. We propose a head-body finite automaton (HBFA), which implements SPM in two parts: a head DFA (H-DFA) and a body NFA (B-NFA). The H-DFA matches the dictionary up to a predefined prefix length in the same way as AC-DFA, but with a much smaller memory footprint. The B-NFA extends the matching to full dictionary lengths in a compact variable-stride branch data structure, accelerated by single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. A branch grafting mechanism is proposed to opportunistically advance the state of the H-DFA with the matching progress in the B-NFA. Compared with a fully populated AC-DFA, our HBFA prototype has <;1/5 construction time, requires <;1/20 runtime memory, and achieves 3x to 8x throughput when matching real-life large dictionaries against inputs with high match ratios. The throughput scales up 27x to over 34 Gbps on a 32-core Intel Manycore Testing Lab machine based on the Intel Xeon X7560 processors.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247434","DFA;NFA;SIMD;String matching;deep packet inspection;multicore platform;variable-stride tree","Automata;Data structures;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Throughput;Vegetation","cache storage;computer network security;data structures;finite automata;multiprocessing systems;string matching","32-core Intel Manycore Testing Lab machine;B-NFA;H-DFA;HBFA prototype;Intel Xeon X7560 processors;SIMD operations;body NFA;branch grafting mechanism;deep packet inspection;head DFA;head-body finite automaton;multicore processors;prefix length;real-life large dictionary matching;robust string pattern matching;scalable string pattern matching;single-instruction multiple-data operations;variable-stride branch data structure","","0","","14","","2012-07-23","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although there are a number of efficient FA compressing mechanisms for DPIs, there is no standardized or common way to evaluate and compare them. In this scenario, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate and compare automaton models and the data-structures that materialize them. We also adapt state-of-the-art memory layouts to better fit in today's computer architectures. Finally, we apply our methodology to most important automaton models, memory layouts, and well-known signature sets. The results show us that some memory layouts are not efficient for regexes that represent small automata and other ones which fit only with uncompressed automata.

In particular, we apply the set packing algorithm to optimize (minimize) the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a Dijkstra's based optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing between the communications of the nodes.

We present the basic ideas, discuss the main implementation issues, and perform a preliminary experimental campaign. Not only have experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in protecting the system against two very serious attacks to WSNs (namely: sinkhole, and bogus packet), but they have also proved that the stringent requirements (in terms of limited availability of resources) which are typical of current state-of-the-art WSN technologies, are met.","","978-1-4244-8080-7","","10.1109/CRIS.2010.5617547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5617547","Critical Information Infrastructures;Critical Infrastructures;Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","bogus packet;critical information infrastructures;intrusion detection system;malicious activities;sinkhole;wireless sensor network","","6","","34","","","20-22 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This sketch is used to reduce the required memory, while monitoring the traffic, by maintaining them into a predefined fixed size of hash tables. This sketch is also used to develop a probabilistic model. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used for detecting deviations between previously established and current distributions of network traffic.

Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic. As far as we know we are the first paper, that analyzes the problem of 'on-the-fly' multi-patterns matching algorithms on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061944","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Compression algorithms;Computer science;Data security;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;data compression;digital signatures;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;GZIP compression;HTTP protocol;Web traffic;compressed HTTP traffic;decompression phase;malicious activity detection;network security tool;signature-based detection;string-matching algorithm","","5","3","25","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Normal operational behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks are a concern.

Due to this phenomenon, how to provide the aged people and the patients with chronic diseases a suitable environment of health care has become a critical issue currently. Therefore, we propose a new scheme that applies health care within wireless sensor networks in which sensor nodes can measure the vital signs of the aged people and the patients. The vital signs for blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature measured by sensor nodes would be transmitted to mobile devices of medical staff and system administrator. Sensor node readings enable the medical staff to understand the conditions of the patients in real time which improves the quality of health care for the patients. According to the personal data protection act, the vital signs of the patients can only be accessed by the authorized medical staff. In order to protect the privacy of patients, the administrator will verify the identity of medical staff through the mobile device with smart card and password. Accordingly, only the verified medical staff can obtain the vital signs such as blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature of the patients. Besides, the scheme includes a characteristic of time-bounded, and then the medical staffs can obtain the vital signs without re-authenticating and re-login into the system in a period of time.

This can be a complex task. In this article we describe an integrated framework for the design, evaluation, and deployment of network resilience strategies. These strategies describe the management behavior of a number of federated, policy-controlled resilience mechanisms, such as monitoring and detection systems.

However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177","Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management","Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism","","0","","11","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly detection in networks is of interest from two perspectives: an organization's perspective and an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) perspective. Protection of its computer network infrastructure is an important task for all organizations. Organizations desire that their networks are robust and resilient to any kind of attack. Anomaly detection forms an important part of this network resiliency. Also the ISPs want to maximize the utilization of their resources. Hence an ISP would be interested to know any resource failure immediately so as to correct the problem. ISPs would also be interested in safeguarding their network from malicious activities. We describe here a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based traffic verification system as a paradigm for network anomaly detection. The traffic characteristics aggregated over a period of time is given to the model to verify the validity of the traffic. If the traffic does not obey the model then we raise an alarm flagging it as an anomaly. Our results show that the system performs with less than 1% misses and false alarms.","","978-1-4673-0815-1","","10.1109/NCC.2012.6176909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6176909","Anomaly detection;Gaussian Mixture Model;Intrusion detection;Network Traffic Modeling;Network security","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Data models;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Training;Vectors","Gaussian processes;Internet;computer network security","GMM-based traffic verification system;Gaussian mixture model;ISP perspective;Internet Service Provider;computer network infrastructure protection;network anomaly detection;network resiliency;organization perspective;port-based traffic verification;resource failure;traffic characteristics","","1","","18","","","3-5 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the major sophisticated threats that happen to be very difficult and challenging to counter due to its distributed nature and resulted in cloud service disruption is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Even though there are number of intrusion detection solutions proposed by different research groups, and cloud service providers (CSP) are currently using different detection solutions by promising that their product is well secured, there is no such a perfect solution that prevents the DDoS attack. The characteristics of DDoS attack, i.e., Having different appearance with different scenarios, make it difficult to detect.

The resultant model shows how the system behaves when a failure condition occurs and acts as a basis model that ensures safety through requirement validation.

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of current techniques for root kit detection only allow a late detection after the malware has already been hidden by a root kit. In this paper, a new technique is presented that enables the proactive detection of root kits while they are hiding malware, and therefore, allowing that hiding can be avoided. The technique has been designed for root kits that operate in kernel-mode. This root kits are particularly difficult to detect because both the detector and the root kit are executed with the same privileges.

The model is composed of the subsystem of the tracking of the attacks and the subsystem of filtering of the attack flows. The function of the former is to reconstruct the attack paths using the information from the marked packets while the function of the later is to filter the attacking packets according to the information obtained from the former. The model has a higher efficiency in reconstructing attack path by using a novel authenticated packet marking scheme for IP trace-back. So, it can correspond to the attack flow in a short time. In addition, flow detection and neural network is also used in the model so that the model is more powerful in the functions of identification and filtering of attack packets and protection of the legitimate flows.","","978-0-7695-3881-5","","10.1109/WCSE.2009.704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403249","DDoS attack;active defense;neural network Introduction;packet filtering;packet marking","Active filters;Computer crime;Computer science;Electronic mail;Information filtering;Information filters;Neural networks;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","information filtering;message authentication;neural nets","IP trace-back;active DDoS defense model;attack flow filtering;attack packet filtering identification;authenticated packet marking scheme;flow detection;legitimate flow protection;neural network","","1","","7","","","28-30 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After gaining network data package and pattern matching according to the protocol analysis result of primary data, the attack behavior is detected, and the signature database is unceasingly updated by new attack behavior signature. The SSL encryption authentication is used in data package transmission, which can prevent the information leakage and falsifying, and the data remain original. The serious attack behaviors are detected and saved in the evidence database, which can be used as primitive evidence for computer forensics.

In particular, we show how emergence in technical systems can be detected and measured gradually using techniques from the field of probability theory and information theory. To detect or measure emergence we observe the system and extract characteristic attributes from those observations. As an extension of earlier work in the field, we propose emergence measures that are well-suited for continuous attributes (or hybrid attribute sets) using either non-parametric or model-based probability density estimation techniques. We also replace the known entropy-based emergence measures by divergence measures for probability densities (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hellinger distance). We discuss advantages and drawbacks of these measures by means of some simulation experiments using artificial data sets and a real-world data set from the field of intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8537-6","978-0-7695-4232-4","10.1109/SASO.2010.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5630529","intelligent technical systems;organic computing;quantitative emergence","Atmospheric measurements;Density measurement;Entropy;Gaussian distribution;Particle measurements;Q measurement;Time measurement","entropy;model-based reasoning;probability;security of data;systems analysis","divergence measure;entropy-based emergence measure;information theory;intrusion detection;model-based probability density estimation;probability theory;quantitative emergence;technical system","","4","","32","","","Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An essential part of such a test bed is the ability to provide software and hardware interaction to mimic real world scenarios. This paper presents a test bed for the development of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for power systems. The test bed consists of a power system modeled on a real time digital simulator (RTDS), a data collection and processing engine, and a MATLAB/RSCAD parameter calculation engine. This test bed provides a platform for hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation, power system attacks, and generates data sets required by cyber security researchers. Coordinated distance protection and overcurrent protection schemes are implemented on the IEEE 9 bus system and a 3-generator 4 bus system [11].

However, emerging data intensive applications are increasingly unstructured - irregular in their memory and control flow behavior over massive data sets. While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead. Experiments show that while the CDP implementation can generate potentially 1.13x-2.73x speedup over non-CDP implementations, the non-trivial overhead causes the overall performance an average of 1.21x slowdown.","","978-1-4799-6452-9","","10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983039","","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Parallel processing","graphics processing units;resource allocation;storage management","CUDA dynamic parallelism;coarse-grained blocks;control flow behavior;dynamic parallelism analysis;dynamic parallelism characterization;dynamically formed parallelism;dynamically formed pockets;emerging data intensive applications;fine-grained threads;massive data sets;memory behavior;structured applications;structured data parallelism;unstructured GPU applications;workload balance","","0","","31","","","26-28 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These benefits are incentives for users to cheat about their current location, in order to get unauthorized access to resources and services provided by location-sensitive applications. To deal with this issue, we propose CREPUSCOLO, a collusion resistant and privacy preserving location verification system. In CREPUSCOLO, we use “location-proofs” collected from co-located mobile devices, which can be endorsed by a “token” acquired from a trusted Token Provider. In fact, location-proofs endorsed by tokens provide the resiliency against collusion attacks, because this combination can prove that a certain mobile device was at a certain location at a specific time. CREPUSCOLO also protects the source location privacy by enforcing the usage of periodically changing pseudonyms. Extensive simulations show that CREPUSCOLO is effective in detecting collusion attacks even under very conservative hypothesis. For instance, with just 11 Token Providers spread over a 121 km<sup>2</sup> area characterized by a very low density of cooperating devices, 90% of collusion attacks are detected.","","","","10.1109/CRiSIS.2013.6766357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766357","","Authorization;Geology;Jamming;Protocols","authorisation;data privacy;formal verification;mobile computing","CREPUSCOLO;collusion attacks;collusion resistant privacy preserving location verification system;location based access control;location based social networks;location sensitive applications;mobile device;source location privacy;trusted token provider;unauthorized access","","0","","15","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such flexible compositions practically always contain vulnerabilities, which imperil the security and dependability of processes. Vulnerability management tools require patterns to find or monitor vulnerabilities. Such patterns have to be derived from vulnerability types. Existing analysis methods such as attack trees and FMEA result in such types, yet require much experience and provide little guidance during the analysis. Our main contribution is ATLIST, a new vulnerability analysis method with improved transferability. Especially in service-oriented architectures, which employ a mix of established web technologies and SOA-specific standards, previously observed vulnerability types and variations thereof can be found. Therefore, we focus on the detection of known vulnerability types by leveraging previous vulnerability research. A further contribution in this respect is the, to the best of our knowledge, most comprehensive compilation of vulnerability information sources to date. We present the method to search for vulnerability types in SOA-based business processes and services. Also, we show how patterns can be derived from these types, so that tools can be employed. An additional contribution is a case study, in which we apply the new method to an SOA-based business process scenario.","1939-1374","","","10.1109/TSC.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560632","SOA-based business processes;Service security and dependability;vulnerability analysis;vulnerability classification.","Business;Monitoring;Operating systems;Runtime;Security;Service oriented architecture;Standards","business data processing;security of data;service-oriented architecture","ATLIST;FMEA;SOA-based business process;attack trees;service-oriented architectures;vulnerability analysis method;vulnerability management tools","","4","","101","","2010-09-02","July-Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At the same time, information security is an area of growing concern in the space business and among space agencies.

Recently applying artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining techniques to IDS are increasing. Artificial intelligence plays a driving role in security services. This paper proposes an Immune based adaptive intrusion detection system model (IAIDSM). Analyzing the training data obtaining from Internet, the self behavior set and nonself behavior set can be obtained by the partitional clustering algorithm, then it extracts Self and nonself pattern sets from these two behavior sets by association rules and sequential patterns mining. The self and nonself sets can update automatically and constantly online.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A kind of hierarchical clustering approach can help the operators to get a meaningful overview of the alarms by generating clusters one by one. But the clusters obtained generally overlap much, which makes the operators be likely to misunderstand what really happened in the network. We present an extension of the clustering approach using a genetic algorithm based upon a new kind of fitness heuristic. This heuristic ""intelligently"" guides the selection based upon feedback concerning the overlap among the clusters. Unlike the original approach that generates one cluster after another, our implementation generates all clusters at a time.

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes. In this paper, rapid malcode signatures are automatically generated based on their spreading behavior, specially aimed at automatically extracting and deploying signatures on the packet level, without the need for reassembly that could be used by signature-based firewalls network intrusion detection system.

As a new machine learning method, SVM has been used in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) recently and achieved certain effects. While the commonly used kernel functions of SVM such as RBF kernel and Gauss kernel are non-orthogonal, whose detection capacity and speed are unsatisfactory for complex non-linear system in IDS. LS-SVM is an evolution of classical SVM. It looks for the solution by solving linear equations instead of a convex quadratic programming in classical SVM. Wavelet kernel function has the capability of approximately orthogonal and multi-scale analysis, and has better classification and generalizing ability. Experiment on KDD CUP1999 shows our method could raise the accuracy of detection and decrease the false alarm rate.","","","","10.1109/ICCSNT.2013.6967147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967147","intrusion detection;support vector machine;wavelet kernel","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Support vector machines;Testing;Training;Wavelet transforms","convex programming;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;quadratic programming;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;anomaly intrusion detection;convex quadratic programming;false alarm rate;linear equations;machine learning method;wavelet kernel LS-SVM;wavelet kernel least square support vector machine","","0","","10","","","12-13 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the emphasis on detecting intrusions through a second line of defense, in the form of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), is increasing. Selecting an effective and appropriate IDS system should take its functionality and performance evaluation into account. Unbiased and reliable evaluation necessarily depends on a well-engineered evaluation methodology.

Although it offers tremendous opportunities, there are some major challenges, such as security, that must be solved for efficient usage. Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex).","","978-1-4799-0194-4","","10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705192","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Cloud computing;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;data privacy;security of data;trusted computing","AdjointVM approach;capex;capital expenditure;circular chain intrusion detection;cloud computing;confidentiality;data centers;information security;protection architecture defenselessness;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees","","1","","17","","","19-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy. We perform comprehensive analysis on the proposed scheme, including attack analysis, security analysis, and performance analysis.

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards. Our experimental evaluation shows that Scap can capture all streams for traffic rates two times higher than other stream reassembly libraries.

Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies.","","","","10.1109/WETICE.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927063","Indistinguability;Nonmalleability;Secure Scheduling;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Context;Generators;Scheduling;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;quality of service;scheduling;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","communication costs nodes;network lifetime;protocols;quality of service;resource constraints;resource preservation requirement;secure communication infrastructure;secure nodes scheduling algorithm;security framework;wireless sensor networks","","0","","14","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intended impact is dramatically easier integration, maintenance and repair of IDS systems, with only a small impact on system characteristics.","","978-1-4244-9905-2","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949406","","Convergence;Game theory;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Minimization;Robustness;Security","game theory;protocols;security of data","IDS control;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed regret minimization;standard data-transfer protocols","","0","","20","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The DDoS attack, which is consuming all of the computing or communication resources necessary for the service, is known very difficult to protect. The threat posed by network attacks on large network, such as the internet, demands effective detection method. Therefore, an intrusion detection system on large network is need to efficient real-time detection. In this paper, we propose the entropy-based detection mechanism against DDoS attacks in order to guarantee the transmission of normal traffic and prevent the flood of abnormal traffic. The OPNET simulation results show that our ideas can provide enough services in DDoS attack.","","978-1-4673-0495-5","","10.1109/NESEA.2011.6144944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144944","DDoS Detection;DDoS Flooding attack;Distributed Denial-of-Service;Entropy;Quaily-of-Service","Computer crime;Computers;Electronic mail;Entropy;IP networks;Internet;Servers","Internet;computer network security;entropy;telecommunication traffic","DDoS flooding attack detection;Internet;OPNET simulation;abnormal traffic flood prevention;communication resources;computing resources;distributed denial-of-service attack;entropy-based detection mechanism;intrusion detection system;network attacks;normal traffic transmission;step-by-step investigation","","3","","13","","","8-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"TFA: A Tunable Finite Automaton for Pattern Matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems","Yang Xu; Junchen Jiang; Rihua Wei; Yang Song; Chao, H.J.","Polytech.

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778","Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management","finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data","Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton","","0","","25","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Curve-based planar graph routing with guaranteed delivery in multihop wireless networks","Frey, H.; Hollick, M.; Loch, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ.

Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. Thus, real-world constraints such as network congestion, limited node energy levels, or non-cooperation of nodes might severely impact the performance and the robustness of existing planar graph routing variants. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We investigate basic schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network, and derive algorithms for routing and forwarding along these curves. We analytically prove that our scheme is loop free and allows for guaranteed delivery in arbitrary planar connected graphs. We implement curve-based routing and show its feasibility by means of a simulation study. As a proof-of-concept scenario, we investigate the case of non-cooperating nodes. Our results show that curve-based routing is able to sustain the delivery of packets where traditional schemes fail.","","978-1-4673-1238-7","978-1-4673-1237-0","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263689","Algorithms;delivery guarantees;localized routing;network protocols;wireless multihop networks","Clocks;Joining processes;Routing;Spread spectrum communication;Trajectory;Wireless networks","radio networks;telecommunication network routing","curve-based planar graph routing;face routing extension;guaranteed delivery;limited node energy levels;localized geographic routing schemes;multihop wireless networks;network congestion;noncooperating nodes;proof-of-concept scenario;real-world constraints","","2","","17","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a novel framework, OptiFilter, that mines network packets and host events, based on significant features in intrusion detection. The framework collects network packets and host events continuously in real-time and parses them to a queue of dynamic windows, then it generates connection vectors accordingly. We evaluate the framework in a real-time heterogeneous network and compare it with other benchmark datasets. Our framework shows promising results with minimal processing time for maximum amount of packets. Moreover, it can constantly produce significant and meaningful datasets for evaluating intrusion detection systems.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785478","Computer network management;Intrusion detection;Performance monitoring","Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Real-time systems;Vectors","computer network management;computer network security;data flow analysis;data mining;packet switching","OptiFilter;connection vector generation;dynamic window queue;host event mining;host events collection;information technology;intrusion detection model evaluation;network packet collection;network packet mining;online data flow;persistent dataset generation;real-time heterogeneous network;real-time operative framework","","0","","18","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
