However, individual sensor nodes are vulnerable to some types of attacks because they are usually deployed in open and unprotected environments. Once sensor nodes are compromised, malicious nodes can send erroneous data to the base station, and possibly mislead monitoring results and influence the whole networks' effectiveness. We need to find new mechanisms to protect the wireless networks from attacks. In this paper we develop a scheme for malicious node detection based on weighted-trust evaluation. A weight value is assigned to each sensor node initially. It updates every cycle if the node sends different report from the others. A malicious node will be detected when its weight value is lower than a threshold value. The simulation results show that our approach is more effective in detecting malicious nodes with lower misdetection ratio compared with existing schemes.","1976-0035","978-1-4244-8813-1","","10.1109/ICUT.2010.5677764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677764","","Base stations;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Simulation;Time factors;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","improved intrusion detection;malicious node detection;weighted trust evaluation;wireless sensor networks","","2","","15","","","16-18 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902777","Network traffic analysis;network traffic identification;protocol reverse engineering;unsupervised information extraction","Algorithm design and analysis;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols;Redundancy","Internet;computer network management;protocols;unsupervised learning","ProWord approach;application protocols;common string;deep packet analysis rules;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram;network management system;network measurement system;network security system;ranking algorithm;traffic payload;unsupervised protocol feature word extraction;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting experts algorithm","","0","","44","","2014-09-18","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To study these attacks, the honeypot must capture and log large amounts of data which are very difficult to process manually. So, the analysis of these logs has become a very difficult and time consuming task. To resolve this problem, several researchers have proposed the use of data mining techniques in order to classify logged traffic and extract useful information. In this paper, we present a data analysis tool for our Honeypot Router. This tool is based on data mining clustering. The main idea is to extract useful features from data captured by the Honeypot Router. These data will be then clustered by using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm in order to classify the captured packets and extract those that are suspicious. Suspicious packets will be then verified by a human expert. This solution is very useful to detect novel routing attacks.","","978-1-4244-7716-6","","10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5587041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587041","Clustering;Honeypot Router;data analysis;data mining;routing attack detection","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data analysis;Data mining;Feature extraction;Routing;Routing protocols","data analysis;data mining;security of data","Honeypot router;data analyzer;data mining;security tool","","2","","17","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rule - based mechanisms which are tedious and error prone. Other methods are based on statistical modeling, these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we have identified the limitations of the current techniques and propose a model for alert correlation that overcomes the shortcomings. An improved ""require/provide"" model is presented which established a cooperation between statistical and knowledge-based model, to achieve higher detection rate with the minimal false positives. A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs. The proposed model has been implemented in real-time and has successfully generated security events on establishing a correlation between attack signatures. The system has been evaluated to detect one of the most serious multi-stage attacks in cyber crime -- SQLIA (SQL Injection Attack). Typical SQLIA steps are analyzed within the realm of simulated malicious activities normally used by cyber criminals. The system has efficiently established a correlation in attack behaviors and has generated an attack map. The map can be used to discretely analyze the correlated attack activities which in other case may go undetected thus facilitating the multi-stage attack recognition process.","1550-445X","978-1-61284-313-1","978-0-7695-4337-6","10.1109/AINA.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763386","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;SQL Injection;multi-stage attac","Correlation;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Mars;Probabilistic logic;Real time systems;Security","SQL;security of data;statistical analysis","SQL injection attack;SQLI activities;attack signatures;cyber crime;event based alert correlation system;knowledge based model;rule based mechanisms;statistical modeling","","0","","24","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our strategy efficiently utilizes the high degree of the on chip parallelism and the complicated memory hierarchy of the GPU so that the aggregate performance (or throughput) for the AC algorithm can be optimized. The strategy significantly cuts down the effective memory access latencies and efficiently utilizes the memory bandwidth. Also, it maximizes the effects of the multithreading capability of the GPU through optimal thread scheduling.

DoS attacks can compromise the availability of wireless mesh networks as such attacks would essentially prevent one or more nodes from accessing or providing specific services.","","978-1-4244-5956-8","","10.1109/ITC.2010.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460544","Cross Layer Design;DoS Attacks;IDS;Multihop Routing","Availability;Clouds;Computer crime;IP networks;Jamming;Physical layer;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Wireless mesh networks","Internet;security of data;signal detection;wireless mesh networks","DoS attacks;Internet connectivity;detection methods;security;service attack denial;wireless Internet service providers;wireless mesh networks","","2","","18","","","12-13 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application. A proprietary medium access control is developed based on the low-power SimpliciTI radio stack. Network performance is assessed by experimental measurements using a test-bed operating at 868MHz in an indoor office environment with severe multipath and non line-of-sight propagation conditions.","","978-1-4673-0681-2","","10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215493","","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors;Synchronization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;alarm systems;indoor communication;safety systems;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","M2M networks;SimpliciTI radio stack;frequency 868 MHz;indoor intrusion detection;medium access control;multipath propagation;nonline-of-sight propagation;periodic low power monitoring service;protocol design;real time alarm propagation mechanism;smart surveillance;wireless machine-to-machine;wireless network prototype;wireless networks","","0","","14","","","1-1 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This sensor evolved from the technology of ldquoGUIDARrdquo pioneered in the 1970's to bring intrusion location to perimeter sensors. OmniTrax theory of operation, based on a unique application of new Ultra Wideband Radar was described, as well as its feature of allowing pinpoint location of intrusions along 800m of sensor cable using a single processor. This feature is fundamentally important to direct the response force, and also for rapid debug and maintenance of the installation. Since that first presentation the sensor has been fully realized as one of the most cost-effective ranging perimeter sensors with its own integrated power and communications network. It has also been evaluated for both detection and environmental performance at our own local test site (SITE), and at independent government sensor test agencies. Further components of the technology have been developed to enlarge the range of site applications. This paper provides an update on the technology and its application including some new applications for leaky coaxial cable technology.

"Distributed monitoring of conditional entropy for anomaly detection in streams","Arackaparambil, C.; Bratus, S.; Brody, J.; Shubina, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum (IPDPSW), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on","20100524","2010","","","1","8","In this work we consider the problem of monitoring information streams for anomalies in a scalable and efficient manner. We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","5","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Vampire bats: Trust in Privacy","Kosa, T.A.","Fac. of Sci., Univ. of Ontario Inst. of Technol., Oshawa, ON, Canada","Privacy Security and Trust (PST), 2010 Eighth Annual International Conference on","20100930","2010","","","96","102","Trust and privacy are ancient social concepts. Work on formalizing trust dates back to the mid-nineties, while work on formalizing privacy is in its infancy. The two concepts have a number of similarities including considerations of information type and sensitivity to inform actions, relationship between the communicating parties, and the context or purpose for communication. There are some key differences. Privacy, unlike trust, is legislated. In Canada, there are also a number of regulations, directives and policies that come along with the legislation. Trust, on the other hand, is the Wild West; almost anything goes. Early attempts at formalizing privacy have been largely restricted to P3P initiatives and other policy developments. Not only have they been largely ignored by the user community, but also because of the limited scope in application seem to fail to actually enable privacy protection. On the other hand, early trust models have taken a different approach. Instead, using a natural science approach and artificial agents, trust is circumscribed, simple and most importantly - repeatable. In the context of failed attempts at formalizing privacy through policy, learnings from trust can be utilized to advance the computational notion of privacy protection. This paper takes the work on formalizing privacy in a much needed new direction by examining the potential of an appropriate and applicable framework for privacy based on extant trust formalizations. It proposes a formalization for privacy can be based on trust, and would outline the types of privacy, examine privacy based decision-making, and explore the applicability of the agents as appropriate representations of people in the computational environment.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593227","privacy;trust","Computational modeling;Data privacy;Law;Legislation;Ontologies;Privacy;Social network services","security of data","privacy formalizations;trust formalizations;vampire bats","","1","","29","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The circular sequences of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process is replaced by circular body, then, a little data is extracted from normal system call sequences, and is transformed to decisive table, afterward, the decisive table is reduced and the simplest rules that present normal behavior mode is extracted by rough sets theory. These rules can be used to detect anomalous behavior. In order to realize the quick detection of known intrusion, an engine of quick detection inspired by hidden markov model was presented in this paper. Compared with other methods in the literature, the method presented in this paper is not only able to extract a set of effective detection rules with the minimum size from part of records of system call sequences, but also can detect the known intrusion quickly.

In the networks the worm may consist of some list of vulnerable in particular targeted network. While the targeted hosts occurs it start propagates rapidly using the list. This factor may lead to the transactions terminal and it cannot guarantee for safety. Most detecting methods don't detect the worms in effective manner.

The stages are stable, vulnerable presence, exploit and zombie. By using this we can easily identify the worms and it can be detected. Intrusion detection method performs a major task.

Several such metrics have been proposed, but their quality has not been studied. This paper presents a statistical analysis of how 18 security estimation metrics based on CVSS data correlate with the time-to-compromise of 34 successful attacks. The empirical data originates from an international cyber defense exercise involving over 100 participants and were collected by studying network traffic logs, attacker logs, observer logs, and network vulnerabilities. The results suggest that security modeling with CVSS data alone does not accurately portray the time-to-compromise of a system. However, results also show that metrics employing more CVSS data are more correlated with time-to-compromise. As a consequence, models that only use the weakest link (most severe vulnerability) to compose a metric are less promising than those that consider all vulnerabilities.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6259801","Network-level security and protection;network management;phreaking);risk management;unauthorized access (hacking","Authorization;Computational modeling;Computer crime;Mathematical model;Network security;Risk management;Telecommunication network management","security of data;statistical analysis","CVSS data;NVD;US National Vulnerability Database;attacker logs;common vulnerability scoring system;computer systems;empirical analysis;international cyber defense exercise;network traffic logs;network vulnerabilities;observer logs;security vulnerabilities;statistical analysis;system-level vulnerability metrics;time-to-compromise","","5","","46","","2012-08-03","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We used data from four commonly-used security sources, namely Snort alerts, reconnaissance and vulnerability scanners, blacklists, and a search engine, to manually investigate these incidents. Based on our experiment, we first evaluate the (complementary) utility of the four security data sources and surprisingly find that the search engine provided useful evidence for diagnosing many more incidents than more traditional security sources, i.e., blacklists, reconnaissance and vulnerability reports. Based on our validation, we then identify and make available a list of 138 good Snort signatures, i.e., signatures that were effective in identifying validated malware without producing false positives. In addition, we compare the characteristics of good and regular signatures and highlight a number of differences. For example, we observe that good signatures check on average 2.14 times more bytes and 2.3 times more fields than regular signatures. Our analysis of Snort signatures is essential not only for configuring Snort, but also for establishing best practices and for teaching how to write new IDS signatures.","","978-1-4799-0458-7","","10.1109/SPW.2013.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565238","IDS;Infections;Malware;Network forensics","Correlators;Forensics;Malware;Manuals;Reconnaissance;Search engines","digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software;search engines","IDS signatures;Snort alerts;Snort signatures;blacklists;evidence collection;evidence correlation;malware;network forensics analysis;operational environment;reconnaissance;search engine;security data sources;security incident manual forensics investigation;vulnerability scanners","","3","","25","","","23-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With new SDN architecture, some security threats are common to traditional networking, but the profile of these threats (including their likelihood and impact and hence their overall risk level) changes. Moreover, there are some new security challenges such as bypassing predefined mandatory policies by overwriting flow entries and data eavesdropping by inserting fraudulent flow entries. This paper is to design open-flow specific security solutions and propose a comprehensive security architecture to provide security services such as enforcing mandatory network policy correctly and receiving network policy securely for SDN in order to solve these common security issues and new security challenges.

This paper describes an approach for simultaneously examining multiple network and host abstraction layers to discover anomalous behavior and then correlating anomalies to determine whether an attack is taking place and, when applicable, select an automatic response. We have used this approach to implement host-based and network-based intrusion detection systems, HIDAR and NIDAR, for enterprise networks, as well as sister systems for tactical networks.

We take a new online bagging classification model that is based on incremental learner such as Naive Bayes classifier and can keep enough history information and create good diversity between different component classifiers. Then we take an offline scheme to do the ensemble reconstruction and ensemble subset selection: that is to drop certain number of classifiers periodically and use only a portion of the whole ensemble, the combination of which may yield better accuracy to make classification.

A running average filter was modeled along with a noisy sensor signal, and the filter responded very rapidly to the attack on the simulated device.","1091-0050","978-1-4799-0052-7","","10.1109/SECON.2013.6567502","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567502","MANET;MATLAB;filter;replay attack;security;simulation","Ad hoc networks;Computer architecture;Data models;Filtering;Mobile computing;Noise measurement;Security","information filtering;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","MANET;architectural component;cyber security attack;dynamic network topology;emergency response team network;military communication network;mobile ad hoc network;noisy sensor signal;replay attack;running average filter;security measure;sensor data filtering","","0","","5","","","4-7 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Preventing the Mistraining of Anomaly-Based IDSs through Ensemble Systems","Fellin, C.; Haney, M.","Inst. for Inf., Security Univ. of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK, USA","Services (SERVICES), 2014 IEEE World Congress on","20140922","2014","","","66","68","The security of cloud networks is heavily contingent upon their ability to detect incoming attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors a network for precisely this purpose. IDSs fall into one of two categories: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Whereas signature-based IDSs rely upon pre-programmed matching rules designed by security experts and are therefore limited to pre-existing attacks in their coverage, anomaly-based IDSs attempt to identify normal and abnormal traffic, generally using machine learning, and therefore hold the promise of being able to identify novel attacks. Anomaly-based IDSs can be divided into IDSs that are trained online and IDSs that are trained offline. While IDSs that are trained online allow greater flexibility, such IDSs could be trained by an adversary to allow specific attacks. This work-in-progress paper proposes a methodology for protecting against the mistraining of an IDS trained online. Two IDSs begin with identical rule sets, but one is allowed to adjust its data to include online data while the other remains static. Both systems can report anomalies, and if the online IDS attempts to let through too much that the offline IDS does not, the decision boundaries of the online IDS are adjusted as a safeguard against mistraining. An experiment for testing the approach is proposed.","","978-1-4799-5068-3","","10.1109/SERVICES.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903245","information security;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms","Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Training data","cloud computing;digital signatures","anomaly-based IDS;cloud networks;ensemble systems;intrusion detection system;security;signature-based IDS","","0","","9","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system is designed to protect the radar data against unauthorized parties. From the previous work, there was a weakness in the pseudorandom number generator. The generated number could not satisfy the randomness, it might be raise a security problem. Thus, Pseudorandom Number Generator (PNRG) using chaos algorithm was added to strengthen the salt cryptographic scheme.

As a result of this paradigm shift, many key concerns such as the transparency of data transfer and access within the cloud, and the lack of clarity in data ownership were surfaced. To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud. Our framework, known as TrustCloud, contains a suite of techniques that address cloud security, trust and accountability from a detective approach at all levels of granularity. TrustCloud also extends detective techniques to policies and regulations governing IT systems.","","978-1-4244-9276-3","","10.1109/DSR.2011.6026885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026885","TrustCloud framework;accountability;cloud computing;cloud computing security;data-centric logging;trust","Business;Cloud computing;Google;History;Security;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;security of data;system monitoring","IT systems;TrustCloud;cloud computing security;cloud computing trust;cloud security;computing services;data access;data accountability;data ownership;data retention;data transfer;data-centric logging-accountability;data-centric thinking;security of data;system-centric logging-accountability","","8","","13","","","3-5 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","978-1-4673-5524-7","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","1","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to obtain good accuracy in the evaluation, very large datasets should be considered. Intrusion traffic and normal traffic are in general dependent on a large number of network characteristics called features. However not all of these features contribute to the traffic characteristics. Therefore, eliminating the non-contributing features from the datasets, to facilitate speed and accuracy to the evaluation of machine learning techniques, becomes an important requirement. In this paper we suggest an approach which analyzes the intrusion datasets, evaluates the features for its relevance to a specific attack, determines the level of contribution of feature, and eliminates it from the dataset automatically. We adopt the Rough Set Theory (RST) based approach and select relevance features using multidimensional scatter-plot automatically. A pair-wise feature selection process is adopted to simplify. In our previous research we used KDD'99 dataset and validated the RST based approach. There are lots of redundant data entries in KDD'99 and thus the machine learning techniques are biased towards most occurring events. This property leads the algorithms to ignore less frequent events which can be more harmful than most occurring events. False positives are another important drawback in KDD'99 dataset. In this paper, we adopt NSL-KDD dataset (an improved version of KDD'99 dataset) and validate the automated RST based approach. The approach presented in this paper leads to a selection of most relevance features and we expect that the intrusion detection research using KDD'99-based datasets will benefit from the good understanding of network features and their influences to attacks.","1091-0050","978-1-4673-1374-2","","10.1109/SECon.2012.6196965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196965","NSL-KDD dataset;Rough Set Theory;intrusion detection;labeled datasets;relevance feature selection","Approximation methods;Cleaning;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;security of data","KDD'99-based datasets;NSL-KDD dataset;automated RST based approach;data cleaning;intrusion detection system;intrusion traffic;machine learning technique;multidimensional scatter-plot;network characteristics;network features;noncontributing feature;pairwise feature selection process;redundant data entries;relevance feature selection;rough set theory","","1","","17","","","15-18 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","2","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is widely used in critical national infrastructure, such as electric power, petroleum and chemical industries. Once an attack against the CPS obtains success, the consequence will be unimaginable. A well-designed risk assessment of CPS will provide an overall view of CPS security status and support efficient allocations of safeguard resources. Though there is much relationship between CPS and IT system, they are still different in various aspects, especially the requirement for real-time. Therefore, traditional risk assessment method for IT system can't be directly applied in CPS. New ideas on CPS risk assessment are in urgent need and one idea about this is addressed in this paper. Firstly, it presents a depict description of a three-level CPS architecture and makes an analysis on the corresponding security features in each level. Secondly, it sums up traditional risk assessment methods analyzes the differences between cyber physical system security and traditional IT system security. Finally, the authors blaze a trail under the new perspective of CPS after breaking the restriction of traditional risk assessment methods and propose a risk assessment idea for CPS.","","","","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2013.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846672","CPS;attack tree;risk assessment;simulation","Computer crime;Data communication;Information security;Quantization (signal);Risk management;Software","critical infrastructures;risk management","CPS risk assessment;CPS security status;IT system security;chemical industry;critical national infrastructure;cyber physical system security;cyber systems;cyber-physical system risk assessment;electric power;petroleum industry;risk assessment idea;risk assessment method;safeguard resources;security features;well-designed risk assessment","","0","","13","","","16-18 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rough set can reduce dimensions of attributes and filter some invasion behaviors which are esay to identify. Secondly, less attributes selected by RS are input FSVM to train and classify, this method can improve operational speed of FSVM. For this model, FSVM uses an effective Fuzzy Membership Function based on the affinity among sample points to select an appropriate fuzzy membership to reduce the effects of outliers.

Wireless communication offers the benefits of low cost, rapid deployment, shared communication medium, and mobility; at the same time, it causes many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as “1” and the other is marked as “0.” During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the updating of the dynamic encryption key.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2264537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584806","Dynamic secret-based encryption;ZigBee;retransmission;security;smart grid;wireless communication","Encryption;Monitoring;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Zigbee;cryptography;power system security;smart power grids","ZigBee protocol;dynamic encryption key;dynamic secret;encryption scheme;power system;retransmission sequence;security problems;shared communication medium;smart grid wireless communication","","3","","29","","2013-08-22","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding). In our proposed system, any intrusion activity will cause significant variations, thereby causing a large error, while a minor aberration in the variations (concept drift) w- ll not be immediately reported as alert.","","978-1-4577-1375-0","","10.1109/THS.2011.6107850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107850","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems;Concept Drift;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Engines;Entropy;Feedback control;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Kullback-Leibler divergence;ROC curve;adapting ROC thresholding;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;concept drift detection;concept-drifting data stream mining;control theoretic model;entropy measurement scheme;feedback control engine;incremental anomaly based detection;network attack;normal traffic pattern profile;receiver operating characteristic curve;supervised machine learning;support vector machine based classifier;user activity","","1","","21","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An IDS triggers thousands of alerts per day which is difficult for human users to analyze them and take appropriate actions. It is important to reduce the false alarm alerts, intelligently integrate and correlate them in order to present a high level view of the detected security issue to the administrator.

The approach therein proposed is based on the construction of an iterative map, whose computation is centralized and guaranteed under suitable conditions on the input visibility and graph connectivity. Under the same conditions, we extend the approach in this work by allowing the construction of a logical linear consensus system that is globally stable in a fully distributed way.

However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.","","978-0-7695-3501-2","","10.1109/CMC.2009.325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797305","Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian game approach;DoS attacks;Nash equilibrium;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes;network defense strategy;node interaction;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor networks","","2","","13","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A SWLAN provides extremely secure mobile wireless data communication with COMSEC, TRANSEC, and monitoring systems to detect PHY and MAC layer misbehavior. However, the SWLAN cannot mitigate a smart jammer that transmits back-to-back packets on the detected channel after scanning all of the channels until a legitimate communication hops to a new channel. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive rapid channel-hopping scheme using Dwell Window and a Deception Mechanism to mitigate smart jammer attacks. The Dwell Window is a novel concept to adjust transmission time based on jammer's capability. The Deception Mechanism is another novel concept to force the jammer to attack an inactive channel by deceiving the jammer.

However the attacker is likely to attempt to reenter the system, and if the attacker succeeds in reentering, it might take some time for the defender's intrusion detection system (IDS) to re-detect the attacker's presence. In this interaction, both the attacker and defender are learning about each other - their vulnerabilities, intentions, and methods. Moreover, during periods when the attacker has reentered the system undetected, he is likely learning faster than the defender. The more the attacker learns, the greater the chance that he succeeds in his objective - whether it be stealing information, inserting malware, or some other objective. Conversely, the greater the defender's knowledge, the more likely that the defender can prevent the attacker from succeeding. In this setting, we study the defender's optimal strategy for expelling or not expelling an intruder. We find that the policy of always expelling the attacker can be far from optimal. Furthermore, by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), we find how the optimal decision depends on the state variables and model parameters that characterize the IDS's detection rate and the attacker's persistence.","","978-1-4244-5870-7","","10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394923","","Computer security;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection","Markov processes;decision theory;information systems;invasive software","Markov decision process;attacker detection;attacker expelling;information system;intrusion detection system;malware","","0","","12","","","Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques. The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292933","","Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers)","computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet;classification task;entropy;features extraction;genetic-based rule learning technique;interval-based representation;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network attacks;network intrusion detection;network traffic;prevention schemes;reliable computer networks;secure computer networks;security breaches monitoring;security mechanism;statistical features;statistical rule learning approach;volume-based approach","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With fixed schedule and urban-wide coverage, an appealing service in SG is to provide free message delivery service to the public using buses, which allows mobile device users to send messages to locations of interest via buses. The main challenge in realizing this service is to provide efficient routing scheme with privacy preservation under highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this problem. In BusCast, buses can pick up and forward personal messages to their destination locations in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each message, BusCast conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a fixed routing path with the message in order to adapt the dynamic of urban traffic. Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the message destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and outside adversaries. Both rigorous privacy analysis and extensive trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficacy of BusCast scheme.","","","","10.1109/PADSW.2014.7097847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7097847","anonymous communication;backward unlinkability;message delivery;traffic analysis attacks;vehicular networks","Bismuth;Delays;Relays;Routing","data privacy;traffic engineering computing;transportation","BusCast scheme;ShanghaiGrid;information service;intelligent mobile device;message destination;privacy analysis;privacy information;privacy preserving message delivery;routing graph;routing scheme;trace-driven simulation;urban bus;urban traffic condition","","0","","16","","","16-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic. The memory overhead added by the algorithm was limited to 0.11%.","","978-1-4577-1125-1","","10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088148","Bloom filters;Snort;intrusion detection;network security;pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Pulse width modulation;Vectors","pattern matching;security of data","Exscind algorithm;Wu-Manber pattern matching;exclusion filter;inclusion filter;signature-based intrusion detection systems;software-based pattern matching","","1","","28","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Privacy is in this respect considered as both the risk of revealing person-sensitive information, for example from critical infrastructures in health institutions, but also to identify and avoid leakage of confidential information from the critical information infrastructures themselves. The architecture integrates privacy enhancing technologies into an enterprise service bus, which allows for policy-controlled authorisation, anonymisation and encryption of information in XML elements or attributes in messages on the service bus. The proposed methodology can be used to identify, quantify and reduce leakages of private or confidential information. It also suggests privacy enforcement mechanisms to increase the resilience against sensitive information leakages caused by cyber attacks.","","","","10.1109/INDIN.2013.6622967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6622967","","Data privacy;Encryption;Entropy;Measurement;Privacy","XML;authorisation;cryptography;data privacy","XML attributes;XML elements;anonymisation;critical information infrastructures;cyber attacks;encryption;enterprise service bus;health institutions;information leakage reduction;person-sensitive information;policy-controlled authorisation;privacy enforcement mechanisms;privacy handling","","0","","41","","","29-31 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, intrusion detectors that adopt allowable and disallowable concepts are used in network forensics. The disallowable policy enforcers alert on events that are known to be bad while the allowable policy enforcers monitor events that deviate from known good. Nevertheless, sophisticated cases of computer attacks often render attempts to isolate failed attacks from successful attacks ineffective. Thus, attacks are erroneous interpreted and most successful cases of computer attacks are not forestalled while in progress despite the huge volume of warnings that intrusion detectors generate beforehand. Therefore, we present a new clustering algorithm to lessen these problems. Series of evaluations showed how to adopt category utility to improve the efficacies of methods for detecting and preventing intrusions. The results also differentiated failed attacks on computer resources from successful attacks.","","978-1-4244-9405-7","978-0-7695-4302-4","10.1109/CloudCom.2010.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708517","Cloud computing;Maximum Transfer Unit;category utility;failed attacks;intrusion detection system","Classification algorithms;Cloud computing;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Computers;Detectors;Security","Internet;cloud computing;pattern clustering;security of data","Web-based applications;cloud computing;clustering algorithm evaluation;computer attacks;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;network forensics;trust relationship","","1","","16","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a first step to launching attacks, attackers scan production networks looking for open services and vulnerable software. These scanning or enumeration activities, if monitored properly, can be used as early warning systems against a much sophisticated and dedicated attack. Honey nets are deployed for the purpose of tracking malicious activities and learn about hackers' origin, methods and attacks. However, today's Honey nets produce an enormous amount of data which becomes a challenge to analyze. In this paper, we attempt to separate and identify scanning traffic from other types of traffic. To accomplish this, we have developed a tool that utilizes known data mining techniques to find the scanning activities in Honey net data, which is an aggregate traffic data collected by multiple Honey pots. Being able to identify scanning activities will allow security analysts to focus more on other types of traffic, and hence be able to study and analyze other types of attacks.","","978-1-4577-0975-3","978-0-7695-4482-3","10.1109/CICSyN.2011.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005682","Data Mining;Honeynet;Intrusion Detection;Scanning","Data mining;Feature extraction;IP networks;Machine learning;Probes;Servers;Time series analysis","alarm systems;computerised monitoring;data mining;security of data","Honey pots;Honeynet data;aggregate traffic data;business;data mining;early warning system;enumeration activity;financial benefits;hacker origin;malicious activity tracking;open services;production network scanning activity;security analysts;unauthorized access;vulnerable software","","0","","23","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These security solutions should be able to scale the application requirements without undue performance and quality overheads to ensure security and privacy of data in the federated Cloud deployments. This paper presents a formal way of testing the impact of scalability and heterogeneity on the federated Cloud security services.

The intrusion detection rate of the transportation information security system is often affected by the structure parameter design of the support vector machine (SVM) model. Improper SVM model design may lead to a low detection precision. To overcome these problems, a new intrusion detection method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SVM is proposed in this paper. The KPCA was adopted to obtain the useful features of the original data to eliminate the redundancy. Then the PSO was employed to optimize the training procedure of the SVM. Thus, satisfactory SVM model with good extendable ability was attained. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the KDD dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods, and thus is available for the transportation information security.","","978-1-4577-0855-8","","10.1109/PACCS.2011.5990290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990290","","Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Support vector machines;Transportation","particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines;transportation","KDD dataset;improved SVM model;intrusion detection;kernel principal component analysis;particle swarm optimization;support vector machine;transportation information security systems","","3","","8","","","17-18 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we monitor the CPU usage of each sensor node and analyze the consistency of the CPU usage. Thus, the proposed algorithm is able to differentiate between the malicious and the legitimate nodes.
