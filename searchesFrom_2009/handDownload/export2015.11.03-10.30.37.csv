Not only it provides various services to users (e.g. calls, instant messaging, internet conferencing etc), but it is also in a process of extending services (e.g. fax service). Due to the open environment of packet switched network, the signaling protocols (such as SIP and H.323) and the transport protocols (e.g. RTP and SRTP) used by VoIP, it is prone to unwanted accesses and does not comply with the security standards. VoIP is also vulnerable to threats from TCP/IP and UDP. Furthermore, the malicious users can exhaust proxy and end users with INIVTE flooding in SIP. In order to overcome these challenging issues, we propose a simple and robust method to detect INVITE flooding on the SIP proxy server by a strategic proxy model that is based on a user-specified threshold. This model is based on the traffic pattern of normal VoIP traffic and the attacked traffic pattern. Unlike considering only stateful proxies, our model is works for both stateless and stateful proxies.","","978-1-4244-9539-9","","10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982572","","Computer crime;Estimation;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers","IP networks;Internet telephony;packet switching;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","H.323;INIVTE flooding;SIP proxy server;SRTP;TCP/IP;UDP;VoIP technology;attacked traffic pattern;end users;flooding attack;malicious users;normal VoIP traffic;packet switched network;security standards;signaling protocols;stateful proxy;stateless proxy;strategic proxy model;strategy based proxy;transport protocols;unwanted accesses;user agent;user-specified threshold;voice over IP technology","","4","","18","","","4-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","0","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firewalls provide a false sense of security because they have inherent flaws that are continuously exploited by hackers. Current firewalls lack in providing adequate security against insiders. Literature suggests that these limitations arise from the deficiencies in firewall design. This paper presents a model of a firewall called disarming firewall. The model is composed of different components, each serving different purpose. The firewall protects against malicious insiders by limiting the attacking capabilities of each internal host. Knowing that obtaining knowledge of end systems is a precursor of an attack, the firewall hides the identity of OS and server software placed in DMZ from internal as well as external users. Another problem solved by the firewall is the general laziness in applying patches to the software. The auditing system of firewall actively monitors all systems in the perimeter and applies patches as soon as they are released.","","978-1-4244-8001-2","","10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625739","Disarmed Host;Firewall;Network Security","Authentication;Fires;Internet;Monitoring;Servers;Software","authorisation;computer crime;operating systems (computers)","auditing system;disarming firewall;hackers;network security;operating system;server software","","0","","22","","","14-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a semantic based intrusion detection scheme where state transition analysis, pattern matching and data mining techniques are integrated to maximize the detection accuracy. Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder. Implementations prove that the proposed hybrid intrusion detection scheme can accurately detect an intruder with the help of a wired network and an appropriate database.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972244","ANTLR;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Grammar;Image sensors;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Radiofrequency identification;Semantics","computer network security;data mining;pattern matching;wireless sensor networks","ANTLR tool;WSN;data mining technique;data streaming;hybrid intrusion detection scheme;metamorphosed;pattern matching;semantic based intrusion detection scheme;semantic rules;spatial domain;state transition analysis;surveillance system;time domain","","1","","19","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we explore the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for such a purpose. Although GP has already been studied for this task, the inner features of network intrusion detection have been systematically ignored. To avoid the blind use of GP shown in previous research, we guide the search by means of a fitness function based on recent advances on IDS evaluation. For the experimental work we use a well-known dataset (i.e. KDD-99) that has become a standard to compare research although its drawbacks. Results clearly show that an intelligent use of GP achieves systems that are comparable (and even better in realistic conditions) to top state-of-the-art proposals in terms of effectiveness, improving them in efficiency and simplicity.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438073","effectiveness;efficiency;genetic programming;intrusion detection","Availability;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Telecommunication traffic","genetic algorithms;security of data","domain-aware genetic programming;fitness function;intrusive traffic;network intrusion detection;normal traffic","","2","","22","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942","Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort","Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data","MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component","","0","","19","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this approach, the inconsistencies often seen in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements are handled with a minimum of calibration. By taking off-line calibration measurement of a ZigBee sensor network, the inherent problem of signal uncertainty of to-be-localized nodes can be effectively resolved. The proposed RSSI-based algorithm allows flexible deployment of sensor nodes in various environments. The proposed algorithm has been verified in several typical environments and experiments show that the method outperforms existing algorithms. The location aware system has been integrated with an autonomous mobile robot to demonstrate the proposed on-demand robotic intruder detection system. In the experiments, three alarm sensors were employed to monitor abnormal conditions. If an intrusion was detected, the robot immediately moves to the location and transmits scene images to the user, allowing the user to respond to the situation in real time.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2277691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587583","Autonomous navigation;location aware system;received signal strength indicator;security robot;sensor network","Mobile nodes;Robot sensing systems;Security;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","Zigbee;calibration;intelligent robots;mobile robots;mobility management (mobile radio);probability;safety systems;service robots","RSSI measurements;ZigBee sensor network;calibration;intelligent behaviors;location aware module;mobile robot;on-demand robotic intrusion detection system;probability-based location aware design;received signal strength indicator;service robot","","1","","26","","2013-08-28","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Conventional detection systems using signature-based and/or rule-based anomaly detection techniques no longer suffice. It is difficult to predict what form the next malware attack will take and these pose a great challenge to the design of a robust intrusion detection system. We focus on the anomalous behavioral characteristics between attack and victim when they undergo sequences of compromising actions and that are inherent to the classes of vulnerability-exploit attacks. A new approach, Gestalt, is proposed to statefully capture and monitor activities between hosts and progressively assess possible network anomalies by multilevel behavior tracking, cross-level triggering and correlation, and a probabilistic inference model is proposed for intrusion assessment and detection. Such multilevel design provides a collective perspective to reveal more anomalies than individual levels.

Our proposed SARIMA based anomaly detection is capable of detecting network bandwidth anomalies effectively when a threshold equals to 8.5 percents of maximum bandwidth in a day.

In this paper, a novel framework based on data mining techniques is proposed for designing IDS. In this framework, the classification engine, which is actually the core of the IDS, uses fuzzy association rules for building classifiers. Particularly, the fuzzy association rule sets are exploited as descriptive models of different classes.

In an effort to solve this problem, researchers have explored different methods of visualizing network security threats. There is little debate that humans can perceive more information visually than textually. The problem is that the majority of visualization tools in practice or proposed do not take efficient visualization techniques into consideration. As a result, it is difficult to get a high-level view of the network that facilitates rapid isolation of network attacks. We propose the Converged Security Visualization Tool (Cover-VT) to solve the efficient visualization problem. Cover-VT was designed to provide analysts with a high-level view of network threats using geographic information systems. The tool allows for rapid identification of threats by minimizing the cognitive obstacles to efficient threat location. Cover-VT includes the capability to drill-down on a node of interest for additional details and even filter out unwanted data. Cover-VT was designed with usability in mind, making it easy to comprehend while assisting the analyst in rapid threat identification. Many different security tools make up a security analyst's tool kit. Cover-VT was developed as an effective security visualization system that integrates existing security tools and network security systems.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990663","Converged Security;Security Management;Visualization","Fires;Monitoring;Visualization","data visualisation;geographic information systems;information networks;security of data","Cover-VT;converged security visualization tool;geographic information systems;network attacks;network security systems;network security threats;rapid threat identification;security analysts;threat location","","0","","16","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","2","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To be highly effective, NIDS must perform packet inspection of incoming traffic at or near wire speed. Failing to do so will allow malicious packets to sneak through the network undetected, and thus jeopardising network security. Snort is one of the most popular IDS and intrusion prevention system (IPS) applications. Snort is a publicly available open-source NIDS application that typically runs on Linux. In this study, the authors present and discuss the essential software components of Snort and its underlying Linux support architecture. The authors characterise Snort execution and present an analytical queuing model to give insight into understanding the kernel and Snort behaviour as well as to identify key-dominating factors that strongly influence and impact Snort performance. The authors demonstrate that the current default configurations of the packet reception mechanism of the Linux networking subsystem (a.k.a. NAPI) are not suitable for Snort performance and show that the performance of Snort can be improved significantly by tuning certain configuration parameters, specifically by having a small NAPI budge value of 2. The performance is measured in terms of throughput and packet loss. The authors also measure the packet loss encountered at the kernel level as well as the interrupt rate of incoming traffic. Performance was measured when subjecting a PC host running Snort to both normal and malicious traffic, and with different traffic load conditions.","1751-8628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2009.0114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5343506","","","Linux;computer networks;queueing theory;reception;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Linux;NIDS;Snort performance;analytical queuing model;computer network;intrusion prevention system;malicious packets;network intrusion detection system;network security;network throughput;network traffic;networking subsystem;packet inspection;packet loss;packet reception","","4","","","","","December 2009","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

These patterns are generated by applying various techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence to the raw event data. The presented technique is then integrated into an event correlation system. We describe the system and evaluate it by analyzing a popular intrusion detection data set consisting of a wide range of different features.","1066-6192","978-1-4244-5672-7","978-1-4244-5673-4","10.1109/PDP.2010.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452408","activation patterns;event correlation;kdd;machine learning;semantic networks;sensor fusion;spreading activation;unsupervised clustering","Artificial intelligence;Data mining;Event detection;Expert systems;Humans;Information processing;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Machine learning;Sensor systems","security of data","activation patterns;artificial intelligence;connection statistics;event correlation system;intrusion detection systems;log entries;machine learning;protocol identifiers;superordinate incidences","","0","","14","","","17-19 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to improve the accuracy of sensors, we adopt a two-stage technique. The first one aims to generate meta-alerts through clustering and the second one aims to reduce the rate of false alarms using a binary classification of the generated meta-alerts. For the first stage we use two alternatives, self-organizing map (SOM) with k-means algorithm and neural GAS with fuzzy c-means algorithm. For the second stage we use three approaches, SOM with K-means algorithm, support vector machine and decision trees. Based on a public data set and several evaluation criteria, our proposed procedures are evaluated.

Although the session hijacking is not in the forefront of everyone mind, it still remains a commonly used attack in MANET. Session hijack attacks are defined as taking over an active TCP/IP communication session without their permission or knowledge. When implemented successfully, attackers assume the identity of the compromised user, enjoying the same access to resources as the compromised user. Network protocols like FTP, Telnet, and rlogin are especially attractive to the attacker, because of the session oriented nature of their connections, and lack of implementation of any security during login, authentication, or data transmission. We introduce a novel method for defending session hijacking attack in MANET: Pseudo Random Alteration of Sequence Numbers (PRAS). Based on the comprehensive evaluation based on simulations, it is shown that PRAS can successfully defend session hijacking under diverse mobile multi-hop network environment with low communication, computation, and memory overhead.","","","","10.1109/ICCT.2013.6820344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820344","Mobile Ad hoc Networks;Sequence number;Session hijacking;TCP attacks","Ad hoc networks;Computer crime;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Receivers;Servers","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;random sequences;telecommunication security;transport protocols","FTP;MANET;PRAS;TCP-IP communication session;Telnet;authentication;data transmission;diverse mobile multihop network environment;mobile ad hoc network;network protocol;pseudorandom alteration of sequence number;rlogin;security;session hijacking attack","","1","","14","","","17-19 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an intrusion detection system (IDS) for MANETs at the application layer. The IDS utilizes (1) both anomaly and misuse detection schemes to identify attacks in MANETs and (2) mobile agents (MAs) to augment each node's intrusion-detection capability. In particular, each node is equipped with a local IDS, and MAs will be dispatched periodically or on-demand to augment each node's IDS.

Therefore, we identify properties of botnet communications that will not be obscured by these measures. This allows us to design features which can be derived by measuring these properties and used as input to an approach for detecting systems infected with a botnet client.

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To enhance security in <i>ad hoc</i> networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of other nodes without central authorities.

These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

Without loss of generality, feature selection can effectively improve the classification model performance, study on the feature selection-based intrusion detection method is therefore very necessary. This paper proposes a simple and quick inconsistency-based feature selection method. Data inconsistency is firstly employed to find the optimal features, and the sequential forward search is then utilized to facilitate the selection of subset features. The tests on KDD99 benchmark data show that the proposed feature selection method can directly eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, without degenerating the classification performance. Furthermore, due to experiments, the intrusion detection performance using the proposed method is also a little advantageous than that with the general CFS method.","","978-1-4244-9114-8","978-0-7695-4297-3","10.1109/CIS.2010.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5696311","Discretization;Feature Selection;Inconsistent Rate;Intrusion Detection","","optimisation;real-time systems;security of data","data inconsistency;data selection;feature selection method;intrusion detection rate;network environments;network intrusion detection application;optimal features;real-time processing;resource consumption","","1","","19","","","11-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve this problem, we focused on anomaly-detection methods. Although these methods have been proposed for computer systems, few studies have focused on IP networks. Therefore, we focused an anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector for detecting faults in IP networks and evaluated whether this method can be applied to IP networks by using network fault simulations. Evaluation results show that the anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector is effective in detecting network faults in IP networks, but it has two problems.

For that importance, IDS has become one of targeted research area that focuses on information security. Among different techniques, Enhanced Steady State Genetic-Based Machine Learning Algorithm (ESSGBML) offers the ability to detect intrusions especially in changing environments. The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless features leads to a simplified problem and enhance detection rate. By combining different selected features that will be evaluated, where this will lead us to determine suitable combination features to attain best results. In ESSGBML, Zeroth Level Classifier System (ZCS) plays the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether it is normal or intrusion. For GA, the probability of crossover will be enhanced by applying fuzzy logic.

Infection in social network are information contents in any of the form like text, images, audio, video, animation etc. There are two main methods for spreading of content over web; conserved spread (SIS model) and non conserved spread (SIR model). This paper uses SI (Susceptible-Infected) model. Infection flow behaviour is analyzed by taking the data i.e. no of infected nodes of a social network in NetLogo environment and simulated for a different size and different average degree network taking input 100 times which helps in correction of data and improves the accuracy of the results.

In this paper, the concept of automatically sifting through a huge volume of alerts to distinguish the different stages of a DDoS attack is developed. The proposed novel framework is purpose-built to analyze multiple logs from the network for proactive forecast and timely detection of DDoS attacks, through a combined approach of Shannon-entropy concept and clustering algorithm of relevant feature variables. Experimental studies on a cyber-range simulation dataset from the project industrial partners show that the technique is able to distinguish precursor alerts for DDoS attacks, as well as the attack itself with a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 22.5%. Application of this technique greatly assists security experts in network analysis to combat DDoS attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116055","Shannon entropy;alert management;distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) detection;k-means clustering analysis;network security;online anomaly detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;digital forensics;entropy;forecasting theory;pattern clustering","DDoS attacks;FPR;IDS;Shannon-entropy concept;clustering algorithm;cyber-range simulation dataset;digital forensic analysis;distributed denial-of-service;entropy clustering approach;false positive rate;forecasting;intrusion detection system;network analysis;proactive forecast;project industrial partner;volume anomaly","","0","","32","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SA algorithm find the optimal point by a form of probability, and it is proved that if enough time is given, the SA can certainly find the optimal point.

In this position paper we provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of the relation between some popular Android permissions and battery consumption by the device while these permissions are allowed. While battery consumption is an issue in different platforms, we chose to study this on Android because of the user's involvement in the Android permission model.

In this paper, we explore the viability and efficacy of a novel graph differential anomaly visualization (DAV) model in the area of network management. Our approach combines algorithmic graph analysis methods and visualization technologies by taking advantages from both computer and human intelligence. We focus on DAV at various levels, i.e., nodes, links and communities. Specifically, a novel community-based DAV scheme is proposed that can help understand the managed networks with a right balance of granularity and complexity. More importantly, the community-based DAV algorithm is less susceptible to network dynamics and high churn.

In particular, the analysis is focusing on the maximum sensing range in terms of azimuth angle, height, sensitivity level for indoor and outdoor implementation. With the help of IoT, sensor which detected motion on weak detection angle or signal could communicate through internet and get signal from nearby sensor for better detection signal. The WSN platform is developed using Octopus II sensor nodes while the microwave motion detector is HB100 which detect movement using Doppler effects. Octopus II will uplink all signal through internet and provide corresponding action of virtual fencing when intrusion detected. Results show maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit is decreasing as azimuth angle increasing. With high sensitivity level of virtual fence unit, the maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit is larger than the maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit at normal sensitivity level.

Unfortunately, this protocol is still vulnerable to the presence of malicious nodes. To detect malicious activities, taking into consideration network lifetime, we randomly select a set of nodes that will play the role of intrusion detection monitors. The selected nodes will monitor the behavior of regular nodes, MPRs, and CHs looking for abnormal activities such as the disruption of cluster head election. Our simulation results show that with 50% of monitors we can detect malicious activities with probability more than 70%.

However, less success has been encountered in mapping data intensive irregular applications such as graph analytics, relational databases, and machine learning. Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks. Experiments with a set of irregular data intensive CUDA applications executing on a cycle-level simulator show that DTBL achieves average 1.21x speedup over the original flat implementation and average 1.40x over the implementation with device-side kernel launches using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism.","","","","10.1145/2749469.2750393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284092","","Cognition;Context;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Organizations;Registers","graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming","1D-3D grid;BSP programming languages;CUDA dynamic parallelism;DTBL;GPU execution model;bulk synchronous parallel programming languages;cycle-level simulator;data intensive irregular applications;dynamic thread block launch;irregular data intensive CUDA applications;lightweight execution mechanism;lightweight thread block dynamic spawning;nested device-side kernel launching functionality","","","","","","","13-17 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host. In this paper, we propose VMCoupler for enabling co-migration of offloaded IDSes and their target VM. Our approach is running offloaded IDSes in a special VM called a guard VM, which can monitor the internals of the target VM using VM introspection. VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination. The migration processes of these two VMs are synchronized so that the target VM does not run without being monitored. We have confirmed that the overheads of kernel monitoring and co-migration were small.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2013.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753786","IaaS clouds;intrusion detection systems;migration;virtual machines","Bridges;Linux;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Ports (Computers);Switches;Synchronization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS offloading;IDSes;IaaS clouds;VM introspection;VMCoupler;guard VM;infrastructure-as-a-service;intrusion detection system;kernel monitoring;synchronized comigration;virtual machine","","2","","19","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The features of packet flows (such as the minimal packet inter-arrival time and the number of packets with non-zero options in TCP headers) are used frequently in determining the traffic type and applying security policies. However, the extraction of flow features is difficult due to the increasing line rates, a broad range of network protocols, and a variety of complex flow features. In this paper, we leverage the multi-core processors to speed up the feature extraction process. We design an open source parallel software tool, aiming for processing network packet flows in real-time. We implement the software in four different designs including serial, parallel, pipelined and hybrid architectures. We evaluate the performance of the parallel software tool through measurement experiments. Our experimental results show that each method increases the packet processing throughput by 5-7% in comparison with the previous method. And finally the implementation based on the hybrid architecture improves the packet processing performance by 19.3% than the implementation based on the serial architecture.","","978-1-4244-8133-0","","10.1109/NAS.2010.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575656","Flow feature extraction;multi-core processors;parallelism","Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Machine learning algorithms;Multicore processing;Payloads;Throughput","computer network security;feature extraction;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;parallel processing;parallel programming;performance evaluation;software tools;telecommunication traffic","high performance flow feature extraction;hybrid architecture;multicore processors;network applications;network protocols;network traffic;open source parallel software tool;packet flows;packet processing;performance evaluation;security policies;serial architecture","","6","","27","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to cryptography based protective techniques such as authentication and authorization, several defense measures, like Intrusion Detection and Tolerance, and tools are employed to protect networks thereby, making security a critical issue. Therefore, the need for defining, structuring, and quantifying security arises as a necessary first step towards measuring the effectiveness of security related deployments. This work proposes a structured approach to define and analyze security related metrics for intrusion tolerant systems for each individual host in the network and compose them in a meaningful way to provide an overall security quantification for a network. The dynamics of each machine against a particular vulnerability is modeled as a (hidden) Markov process to capture uncertainties in attacker's action and system response. Based on these stochastic analysis, security metrics of each machine are calculated which are subsequently used in the final computation of the security metrics of the network.","","978-1-4244-5487-7","","10.1109/COMSNETS.2010.5431978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431978","Markov process;Network security;hidded Markov model;intrusion detection system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probabilities;vulnerabilities","Application software;Authentication;Authorization;Computer networks;Cryptography;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Protection;Uncertainty","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;hidden Markov models;message authentication;probability;stochastic processes","computer network;cryptography based protective technique;hidden Markov process;intrusion detection;intrusion tolerant system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probability;stochastic analysis","","1","","15","","","5-9 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","2","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most background modeling methods fail in the presence of intensity changes, because the model cannot handle sudden changes. A solution to this problem is to use intensity-robust features. Despite the changes of an edge's shape and position among frames, edges are less sensitive than a pixel's intensity to illumination changes. Furthermore, background models in the presence of moving objects produce ghosts in the detected output, because high quality models require ideal backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a robust statistical edge-segment-based method for background modeling of non-ideal sequences. The proposed method learns the structure of the scene using the edges' behaviors through the use of kernel-density distributions. Moreover, it uses segment features to overcome the shape and position variations of the edges. Hence, the use of segments gives us local information of the scene, and that helps us to predict the objects and background precisely. Furthermore, we accumulate segments to build edge distributions, which allow us to perform unconstrained training and to overcome the ghost effect. In addition, the proposed method uses adaptive thresholding (in the segments) to detect the moving objects. Therefore, this approach increases the accuracy over previous methods, which use fixed thresholds.","1051-8215","","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2242551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423877","Background modeling;edge-segments;motion detection;object detection","Adaptation models;Image edge detection;Integrated circuit modeling;Kernel;Lighting;Robustness;Shape","edge detection;image segmentation;image sequences","background dynamism;background modeling;intensity changes;kernel-density distributions;nonideal sequences;statistical edge-segment distributions","","4","","33","","2013-01-30","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Rule extraction methods create interpretable rule sets that act as classifiers. They have mostly been combined with already labeled data sets. This paper aims to combine unsupervised anomaly detection with rule extraction techniques to create an online anomaly detection framework. Unsupervised anomaly detection uses diffusion maps and clustering for labeling an unknown data set. Rule sets are created using conjunctive rule extraction algorithm.

CCSF divides n sequences into m groups and each group contains 20 sequences. Firstly, CCSF generates signatures for each group by adopting color coding and filters them. Then all reserved signatures are clustered to get rid of redundant substrings. In this approach, signature can be generated without any fragment in environments with noise, and it can be used in IDS (intrusion detection system) to detect polymorphic worm.

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.","","","","10.1109/SRDS.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400","Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication","Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery","ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services","","0","","40","","","6-9 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DPMAS uses agent UML, an extension of the UML in Object Oriented domain, as its modeling language. It provides a group of graphs to help designers in modeling multi-agent systems. Many agent specific concepts and denotations are introduced in these graphs. DPMAS suggests a design process that covers requirement specification, task specification, agent specification and deployment description. A tool called AUMP has been developed to aid designers in drawing graphs used in DPMAS. AUMP is the design platform of the well known MAGE 2 agent environments.","","978-1-4244-7081-5","978-1-4244-7082-2","10.1109/ICIC.2010.305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5514037","agent UML;multi-agent system;software engineering","Computer networks;Design methodology;Distributed computing;Finance;Intelligent agent;Multiagent systems;Object oriented modeling;Process design;Software systems;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;multi-agent systems;object-oriented methods;software engineering","DPMAS;MAGE 2 agent environments;UML agent;design method;multi-agent system;object oriented domain","","0","","10","","","4-6 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An attack occurs mainly because of Medium Access Control (MAC) address spoofing. MAC spoofing is a technique where an adversary pretends to be a legitimate client/Access Point (AP) and sends forgery frames to the victim client or AP. Most of existing solutions are prevent DoS attacks after an intruder sending forged frame by spoofing Client or AP's identity. Few solutions are exists to detect an attacker at the time of MAC address spoofing. None of these techniques provides a complete solution.

As the importance of cyber-physical system (CPS) security is growing, various intrusion detection algorithms to protect SCADA system and generation sector have been suggested, whereas there were less consideration on distribution sector. Thus, this paper first highlights the significance of CPS security, especially the availability as the most important factor in smart grid environment. Then this paper classifies various modern intrusion detection system (IDS) techniques for securing smart grid network. In our approach, we propose a novel behavior-based IDS for IEC 61850 protocol using both statistical analysis of traditional network features and specification-based metrics. Finally, we present the attack scenarios and detection methods applicable for IEC 61850-based digital substation in Korean environment.","","","","10.1109/PTC.2015.7232339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232339","Cyber-physical system;IEC 61850;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;smart grid","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Inductors;Measurement;Security","IEC standards;SCADA systems;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids;statistical analysis;substation protection","CPS security;IEC 61850 protocol;Korean environment;SCADA system protection;behavior-based IDS;behavior-based intrusion detection technique;cyber physical system security;digital substation;electricity infrastructure physical environment;fully automated electricity network reliability;smart grid infrastructure;statistical analysis","","0","","13","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sabotaging the quality of the results retrieved by search engines can lead users to doubt the search engine provider. Spam websites can serve as means of phishing. This paper shows a spam host detection approach that uses support vector machines(SVM) for classification. We create a parallel version of standard Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) to determine free parameters of the SVM classifier and apply our proposed model to a content web spamming dataset, WEBSPAM-UK2011. Our implementation of the parallel PSO is constructed on a pool of threads and each thread executes tasks associated to a particle from the swarm. Experiments showed that our proposed model can achieve a higher accuracy than regular SVM and outperforms other classifiers (C4.5, Naive Bayes). Furthermore, parallel version of standard Particle Swam Optimization(PSO) can efficiently select parameters for SVM.","","978-1-4799-3731-8","","10.1109/AQTR.2014.6857840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857840","Particle Swarm Optimization;Support Vector Machine;parallelism;spam host","Accuracy;Kernel;Particle swarm optimization;Sensitivity;Standards;Support vector machines;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;Web sites;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;search engines;security of data;support vector machines;unsolicited e-mail","Internet;PSO;SVM;Web spamming dataset;particle swarm optimization;phishing;search engines;spam Websites;spam host classification;spam host detection;support vector machines","","0","","18","","","22-24 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
