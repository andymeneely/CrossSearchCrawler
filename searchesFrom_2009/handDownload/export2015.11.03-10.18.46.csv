To do that, we propose two different aggregation strategies: fixed prefix and variable prefix. The motivation for doing that is to reduce the number of entries in the bad neighborhood list, thus reducing memory storage requirements for intrusion detection solutions. We also introduce two error measures that allow to quantify how much error was incurred by the aggregation process.

This paper presents various host based anomaly detection techniques. One technique uses clustering with markov network (CMN). In CMN we first cluster the benign training data and then from each cluster we build a separate markov network to model the benign behavior. During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data. We experimentally show that CMN approach outperforms several other approaches and performs similar to CMN-OS and we show that it is less sensitive to noise as compared to other approaches.","","978-1-4799-3143-9","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754055","Computer security;Markov random fields;host-based Anomaly Detection","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Manganese;Markov random fields;Testing;Training;Training data","Markov processes;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;probability;security of data","CLP;CMN;CMN-OS;benign training clustering;clustered label propagation;clustering-with-Markov network;computer-security;host-based anomaly detection techniques;learning techniques;malicious training clustering;outlying subspace;probability calculation","","0","","20","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a challenge to keep the communication route free from such attackers. In this paper, we propose a scheme for Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol, in which an intermediate node detects the malicious node sending false routing information, routing packets are used not only to pass routing information, but also to pass information about malicious nodes. The proposed scheme not only detects but also removes malicious node by isolating it, to make safe and secure communication.","","978-1-4673-0471-9","","10.1109/ACCT.2012.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6168308","AODV;Blackhole Attack;Grayhole Attack;MANETs;Security","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","AODV protocol;DoS attacks;MANET;ad-hoc on-demand distance vector protocol;blackhole attacks;data transmission;dynamic topology;false routing information;grayhole attacks;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;routing packets;safe communication;secure communication;wireless communication","","6","","16","","","7-8 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, with the ever evolving nature of business, and the associated technology for supporting it, requirements for security are also evolving. Computers cannot protect information automatically. To guard information residing on the computers, security services and related technologies need to be applied. Security breaches are constantly changing, often at a speed that is difficult to measure. So security practices and procedures need to be reviewed, tested and upgraded on a constant basis, staying ahead of the game. One way of ensuring better security is to be able to measure its strength, and take steps to improve it in a continuous manner. Several standards are being developed that aim to certify the strength of a security system. However, these standards focus on qualitative evaluation of security level of a system and do not consider either the dynamic aspects of user behavior or the possible vulnerabilities and threats the system may be subjected to. Consequently, there is a need for an alternative quantitative modeling approach for security assessment that overcomes the above mentioned drawbacks of the existing systems. In this paper, we present an extensible framework called iMeasure Security (iMS) that is aimed at quantifying the security strength of an enterprise system and its business impact.","","978-1-4244-5364-1","978-0-7695-3924-9","10.1109/NetCoM.2009.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383971","Attack graph;Business impact;Likelihood estimation;Security quantification","Business communication;Communication system security;Computer networks;Computer security;Information security;Network servers;Protection;Standards development;Testing;Velocity measurement","commerce;computer network security","computer network;enterprise system;iMeasure security;network server;qualitative evaluation;quantitative modeling;security assessment;security quantification;security system","","0","","22","","","27-29 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work explores the viability of machine learning methods in detecting the new threat scenarios of command and data injection. Similar to network intrusion detection systems in the cyber security domain, the command and control communications in a critical infrastructure setting are monitored, and vetted against examples of benign and malicious command traffic, in order to identify potential attack events.

The crossover operator based on generated subnet is adopted considering the relationship between genotype and phenotype. An adaptive mutation rate is applied, and the mutation type is selected heuristically from weight adaptation, node deletion and node addition. When the population is not evolved continuously for many generations, in order to jump from the local optima and extend the search space, the mutation rate will be increased and the mutation type will be changed.

We observe that contemporary, widely-used GPUs, both NVIDIA's and AMD's, do not initialize newly allocated GPU memory pages which may contain sensitive user data. By exploiting such vulnerabilities, we propose attack methods for revealing a victim program's data kept in GPU memory both during its execution and right after its termination. We further show the high applicability of the proposed attacks by applying them to the Chromium and Firefox web browsers which use GPUs for accelerating webpage rendering. We detect that both browsers leave rendered webpage textures in GPU memory, so that we can infer which web pages a victim user has visited by analyzing the remaining textures.

Third International Conference on","20091110","2009","","","107","114","Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions.","2157-2305","978-1-4673-1788-7","","10.1109/SEAMS.2012.6224403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224403","Adaptive security;Adaptive software;Assets;Smart grid","Buildings;Cameras;Energy management;Home appliances;Monitoring;Security;Smart grids","asset management;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","asset variability;customer domain;engineering adaptive security requirement;monitoring function;primary assets;secondary assets;security control;security countermeasures;smart grid;valuable asset management","","2","","8","","","4-5 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common solution is to close the performance gap through hardware implementation of security functions. However, continuously expanding signature databases have become a major impediment to achieving scalable hardware based pattern matching. Additionally, evolutionary rule databases have necessitated real time online updating for reconfigurable hardware implementations. Based on the observation that signature patterns are constructed from combinations of a limited number of primary patterns, we propose to decompose the Snort signature patterns. These smaller primary pattern sets can be stored along with their associations to allow dynamic signature pattern reconstruction. Not only does the matching operation potentially become more scalable, but the real time online updating task is simplified. The approach is verified with patterns from the latest version of the Snort rule database. The experimental results show that after decomposition, a reduction in size of over 77% can be achieved on Snort signature patterns.","","978-1-4244-5047-3","978-1-4244-5048-0","10.1109/DRCN.2009.5339986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339986","Decompose;FPGAs;Finite State Machine;Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS);Scalability;Security","Decision support systems;Hardware;Virtual reality","digital signatures;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;reconfigurable architectures","FPGA;Snort rule database;Snort signature pattern;dynamic signature pattern reconstruction;evolutionary rule database;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching;reconfigurable hardware;security software;signature database","","3","","18","","","25-28 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Outsourcing the data to a cloud in a multitenant environment brings many security challenges including data leaks, threats, and malicious attacks. The cloud computing platform, virtual servers, and the provider's services are highly dynamic and diverse in nature, making the traditional access control mechanisms (e.g., Firewalls and VLAN etc.) less effective in controlling the unauthorized access to cloud's data and resources. Several access control policies and authorization system have been proposed in literature to defend against cloud security threats. Most of these systems are designed to work with one or more access control policies. However, little work has been done to develop generic access control architecture capable to work with most of the available access control policies. In this paper, we present a new access control architecture using a global resource management system (GRMS) to effectively handle both local and remote access requests. The introduction of GRMS makes our proposed architecture semi distributed at the expense of minimal request-response time. In addition, our proposed architecture works effectively with both peered access control module (PACM) and virtual resource manager (VRM) to protect and manage all resources and services of cloud providers from unauthorized access.","","978-1-4673-7286-2","","10.1109/CLOUD.2015.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214083","Access control;cloud computing;role based access control;side channel attack;virtual resource manager","Authorization;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Containers;Virtualization","authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;file servers;resource allocation","GRMS;PACM;VRM;access control mechanisms;authorization system;cloud computing;cloud environment security;cloud providers;cloud security threats;data leaks;generic access control architecture;global resource management system;malicious attacks;multitenant environment;peered access control module;privacy concerns;security challenges;security concerns;semidistributed access control management scheme;unauthorized access;virtual resource manager;virtual servers","","0","","17","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) has been used for the multiplexed bus, there is a problem where it doesn't work at over 1 GHz. Then, the use of the FPGA leads to increase in power consumption. In this work, by using 180 nm C-MOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) technology, waved-shift registers necessary for the multiplexed bus are developed. Furthermore, the comparative evaluations of the waved-shift registers are executed by using the conventional shift register that operates at 2GHz. As a result, the waved-shift registers are revealed to have surpassed all the points of throughput, power consumption and area.","","","","10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6925898","4G mobile communications;C-MOS;multiplexed bus;network security;shift register;wave-pipeline","Application specific integrated circuits;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Lead;Mobile communication;Modems;Registers","4G mobile communication;CMOS integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;multiplexing;shift registers;telecommunication security","180 nm CMOS technology;4G mobile communications;FPGA;HIPS;complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology;field-programmable gate array;frequency 1 GHz;frequency 2 GHz;host-based intrusion prevention system;multiplexed bus;waved-shift register evaluation","","1","","9","","","19-21 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","978-0-7695-4159-4","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","3","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ADBHC generates clusters using density-based partitioning method which has less computational cost. It uses the improved hierarchical clustering tree to implement fast scalable and adaptive anomaly detection. The improved hierarchical clustering tree supports updating profiles at any time. We extend the clustering algorithm and apply branch and bound mechanism for filtering noise. With the help of two advantages: filtering noise and updating profiles at any time, our algorithm is effective enough to meet adaptive requirements.

A static scheduler precedes the cache modules and determines what types of traffic should be forwarded to which module. We also propose several optimizations for each of the modules, such that the storage and memory overhead are minimized. We evaluate the proposed system by performing a trace driven emulation.

The distributed architecture and broadcast transmission characteristics mean they are vulnerable and provide little resistance to intrusive and non-intrusive attack mechanisms. Incorporating data security using traditional approaches introduces significant latency which can be problematic in the presence of real-time deadlines. We demonstrate how a security layer can be added within the network communication controller in modern time-triggered systems, without introducing additional latency or processing overheads. This allows critical communications to be secured in a manner that is transparent to the processors in the electronic control units (ECUs), while also safeguarding network communication properties.","","978-1-4799-6244-0","","10.1109/FPT.2014.7082788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7082788","","Automotive engineering;Encryption;Field programmable gate arrays;Protocols;Synchronization;Vehicles","automotive electronics;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays","FPGAs;electronic control units;network communication controller;time-triggered automotive networks;zero latency encryption","","1","","22","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The large number of potential rendezvous points makes it difficult for law enforcement to effectively shut down botnets. In this paper we present our methodology for detecting algorithmically generated domain flux. Our detection method is based on DNS query failures resulting from domain flux technique. We process the network traffic, particularly DNS traffic. We analyze all DNS query failures and propose a threshold for DNS query failures from the same IP address. We applied our methodology on packet capture (pcap) file which contains real and long-lived malware traffic and we proved that our methodology can successfully detect domain flux technique and identify the infected host.

The proposed method is based on causal approach due to the strength of causal methods in practice. Most of causal methods can be deployed offline but not in real-time due to time and memory limitations. In the proposed method the knowledge base of attack patterns is represented in a graph model called Causal Relations Graph. In offline, we construct some trees related to alerts probable correlations. In real-time for each received alert, we can find its correlations with previously received alerts by performing a search only in the corresponding tree. Thus processing time of each alert decreases significantly. In addition, the proposed method is immune to the deliberately slowed attacks. To verify the proposed method, it was implemented in C++ and we used DARPA2000 dataset to test it. Experimental results show the correctness of the proposed alert correlation and its efficiency with respect to the run time.","","978-1-4673-2387-1","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408197","Alert;Alert Correlation;Attack;Attack Scenario;Graph;Intrusion;Intrusion Detection System","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Memory management;Real-time systems;Security","C++ language;computer network security;knowledge based systems;real-time systems;trees (mathematics)","C++ implementation;DARPA 2000 dataset;IDS alert correlation method;attack patterns;causal approach;causal methods;causal relations graph;graph model;intrusion detection alert correlation;intrusion detection systems;knowledge base representation;real-time attack scenario detection;trees","","1","","20","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Internet worms have become one type of major threats to the network infrastructure. Distributed defense collaborating with single-point-deployed security applications over multiple network domains are promising. However, most of the reported collaborative schemes for distributed defense are application-specific. There is not much research that studies the general properties of variant collaborative schemes systematically. In this paper explores properties of general collaborative defense strategies from the perspective of complex system. A three-layered network modeling platform has been developed. Taking advantage of small-world network model, the platform consists of two network layers and one application layer.

The primary signaling protocol in these multimedia services is Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This protocol, however, is vulnerable against attacks, which may reduce the Quality of Service (QoS), an important feature in NGN services. One of the most frequent attacks is Denial of Service (DoS), which can easily be generated but its detection is not trivial. In this paper, a framework is proposed to detect Denial of Service attacks and other forms of intrusions, then generate responses accordingly. Our proposed detection engine combines the specification- and anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed approach can successfully be employed to detect intruders and limit their access. Detection rates and false alarms are reported based on prepared labeled dataset from the actual test-bed.","","978-1-4244-9153-7","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764552","Denial of Service;Flooding Attacks;Intrusion detection system;Session Initiation Protocol;State Machine","Engines;Floods;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Registers;Servers","IPTV;Internet telephony;multimedia communication;next generation networks;quality of service;security of data;signalling protocols","IPTV;QoS;SIP intrusion detection;VoIP;denial of service attacks;multimedia services;next generation networks;quality of service;response systems;session initiation protocol;signaling protocol","","5","","13","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first question deals with how the packet loss rate affects the sensor alert rate, and the second considers how the network traffic composition affects the results of the first question. Potential places where packet loss may occur are examined by dividing the problem into network, host, and sensor based packets loss. We posit theories about how packet loss may present itself and develop the Packet Dropper that induces packet loss into a dataset. Drop rates ranging from 0% to 100% are applied to four different data sets and the resulting abridged data sets are analyzed with Snort to collect alert loss rate. Conclusions are drawn about the importance of the distribution of packet loss and the effect of the network traffic composition.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888699","Network Intrusion Detection Packet Loss","Intrusion detection;Kernel;Packet loss;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Packet Dropper;Snort;alert loss rate;network intrusion detection;network traffic composition;packet loss distribution;packet loss rate;sensor alert rate","","0","","16","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks can inflict harmful threats to various nodes (SIP proxy servers, User agents, etc) and may cause failure to the SIP system. This is one reason why over 40 proposals, addressing these problems, have been published. Regrettably, not many of these researchers have considered scalability, extensibility and other performance issues by testing their promising prevention techniques in a real network. We find that there are around eight practical frameworks and the aim of this paper is to revisit these countermeasures solutions. We propose a new way of evaluation criteria and a comparative study of the researchers' ideas are being addressed based on the models (if any) used, the network architectures and the results. We however do not judge any of these proposals; instead we give hints on how the attacks on VoIP networks could be further addressed.","","978-1-905824-43-4","","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2014.6880664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880664","DoS/DDoS attacks;IDS/IDPS;Mitigation;SIP;VoIP Defender","Computer architecture;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Floods;Proposals;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computer network security;signalling protocols","DoS-DDoS attacks;SIP based VoIP systems;Session Initiation Protocol;VoIP networks;denial-of-service attack;distributed denial-of-service attack;security frameworks;voice-over-Internet telephony","","0","","29","","","7-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These malicious attempts including hacking, botnets and works are pushing organization networks to a risky atmosphere where the intruder tries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of resources. In order to detect these malicious activities, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been widely deployed in corporate networks. IDSs play an important role in monitoring traffic behaviors in a computer network, identifying the anomalous activity and notifying the security analyst with current network status. Unfortunately, one of the IDSs' drawbacks is they produce a large number of false positives and non-relevant positives alerts that could overwhelm the security analyst. Therefore, the process of analyzing alerts in order to provide a more synthetic and high-level view of the attempted intrusions is needed. This process is called Alert Correlation. In this paper, we present commonly used alert correlation approaches and highlight their advantages and disadvantages from various perspectives. Subsequently, we summarize some current alert correlation models with their alert correlation approach.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836553","Alert Correlatios;Anomaly Detection;Intrusion Detection System;Misuse Detection","Computational modeling;Computers;Correlation;Data mining;Internet;Intrusion detection","security of data","IDS;alert correlation models;intrusion detection systems;malicious attempts;network intrusion attempts","","0","","35","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these applications, delivering information to multiple receivers at the same time makes multicast communication is the next generation dominated data transmission mechanism in mobile ad hoc networks. In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study. Analytical results compare with NS2 simulation results that prove the validity of analytical models. This empirical study illustrates the importance of designing smarter internal attacker detection mechanism to protect multicast routing protocols from the above-mentioned intelligent internal attacks.","","978-1-4799-8466-4","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229740","Byzantine attacks;IDS;MANET;MAODV;attacker prevention technique;internal attacks;multicast","Analytical models;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","access protocols;bandwidth allocation;computer network security;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","Byzantine attack;MAC layer;MANET;MAODV;bandwidth utilization;collision avoidance mechanism;denial of service attack;information delivery;intelligent internal attack;intelligent stealthy attack;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;multicast communication;multicast routing protocol;multicast tree;next generation data transmission mechanism;smarter internal attacker detection mechanism design","","0","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research paper, we explore the plausibility of an attacker or hacker exploiting one of the most popular and commonly used VoIP protocol - Session Initiation protocol (SIP). Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] being derived from HTTP has its own share of strengths and weaknesses. While it constitutes the provisioning of critical and business relevant services e.g. IP Telephony, Instant Messaging, Presence, etc., it is vulnerable to well known and not so well known attacks. This research paper identifies and describes security issues significant to SIP protocol that may lead to Denial of Service (DoS) [2], flooding attacks, attacks exploiting vulnerabilities at the application layer and Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT). In this paper we explore the various security issues pertinent to SIP protocol and diverse ways in which a VoIP system leveraging SIP can be attacked. We also try to explore the most effective methods to thwart or alleviate these attacks.","","","","10.1109/AMS.2013.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664706","DDoS;DoS attack;Flood Attacks;SIP;SPIT;Security;Session Initiation Protocol;VoIP","Authentication;Computer crime;IP networks;Internet telephony;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computer network security;signalling protocols","HTTP;IP telephony;PABX;POTS;Presence;SIP protocol;SPIT;Spam-over-Internet Telephony;VoIP protocol;VoIP-based systems;application layer;denial-of-service attacks;flooding attacks;instant messaging;plain old telephony systems;security implications;session initiation protocol;total cost-of-ownership;voice-over-IP systems","","0","","20","","","23-25 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we propose a simple and uniform framework for the assessment of security, availability, and reliability that arbitrary compositions of security measures can provide. Our methodology facilitates system modeling in a decision-theoretic manner, which makes the models easily understandable even for specialists from fields other than security.

In this paper, we suggest a simulation framework using OMNeT++ to generate benchmarks that resemble real-life traffic.

Generally R2L and U2R attacks are very rare attacks and even in KDD Cup99 dataset, these attacks are only 2% of overall datasets. So, these result in model not able to efficiently learn the characteristics of rare categories and this will result in poor detection rates of rare attack categories like R2L and U2R attacks. We introduce a new approach called cascading classification model based on AdaBoost and Bayesian Network Classifier that can improve the detection rate of rare network attack categories. In this approach we train two classifiers with two different training sets. The KDD Cup99 dataset was splitted into two training sets where one contains full of non rare attacks datasets and other contains datasets of rare attack categories. This cascaded classifier approach increases the detection rates of both rare network attack categories and also it increase overall detection rate of an IDS model. The higher detection rates are due to the mitigation of the influence from the dominant categories if the rare attack categories are separated from the dataset.","","978-1-4673-1599-9","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206789","Adaboost;Bayesian Network;detection rate;dominant attacks;rare attacks","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Training","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","Adaboost;Bayesian Network Classifier;R2L attacks;U2R attacks;cascaded classifier approach;increase detection rate;network intrusion detection;rare network attack categories;unequal distributed attack","","0","","13","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This calls for monitoring solutions that operate at different layers than the application layer (services layer). In this paper we present our ongoing work towards the definition of a monitoring framework for SOAs and services, which relies on anomaly detection performed at the Application Server (AS) and the Operating System (OS) layers to identify events whose manifestation or effect is not adequately described a-priori.

Firewalls do not guarantee cybersecurity, however. The misconfiguration of company firewalls has been reported.

The process can be integrated as part of the intrusion model development process with proper tool support. This will help to identify possible errors in the intrusion model as early as possible. The contribution is to apply well-known aspects from software testing and implement them in the intrusion model testing and validation. The experimental implementation of the proposed process will concentrate on testing intrusion models focusing on detecting port scan attacks.

This model has used transition relationship of DBN and HMM and its better performance inference algorithm to infer next activity.

Up to now, practitioners have decomposed the Smart Grid problem according to each knowledge domain, and, thus, some partial solutions have been presented so far. However, these proposals are often difficult to integrate between each other and with existing platforms due to the fact that they do not consider the Smart Grid as a whole. The purpose of this paper is to propose a simple and complete secured QoS-aware ICT architecture with self-management capabilities, provided by a cognitive system, to meet the requirements of Smart Grids. Presented experimentations show the feasibility of our solution and encourage practitioners to focus their efforts in this direction.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2228869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359928","Cognitive system;QoS routing;Smart Grid;distributed storage;secure infrastructure","Protocols;Quality of service;Reliability;Security;Servers;Smart grids;Wireless sensor networks","intelligent sensors;power measurement;power system management;quality of service;smart power grids","INTEGRIS;QoS;cognitive system;information system;intelligent electrical grid sensor communications;self-management capabilities;smart grids","","3","","56","","2012-11-21","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Defeating the insider threat via autonomic network capabilities","Sibai, Faisal M.; Menasce, D.","Dept. of Comput.

Users with power credentials can do almost anything they want with the systems they own with very little control or oversight. Most breaches occurring nowadays by power users are considered legitimate access and not necessarily intrusions. Developing a solution for such a problem is challenging because power users need flexible requirements to administer or maintain their systems. The increased usage of virtual environments, virtual systems, teleworking, and remote usage has made network access the preferred method for system administration. This paper presents (1) the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS), a framework that provides a solution to this problem and meet the above mentioned challenges, and (2) a proof-of-concept prototype that embeds self-protection capabilities into traditional Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS). AVPS focuses on self-protection against security policy violations instead of malware, vulnerability, or exploit intrusions. AVPS heavily enforces separation of duties, promotes scalability, ease of use and manageability. The proof-of-concept prototype uses Snort in-line NIPS with our own customizations.","","978-1-4244-8952-7","978-1-4244-8951-0","10.1109/COMSNETS.2011.5716431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5716431","","Access control;Inspection;Malware;Payloads;Scalability;Servers","authorisation;computer network security;fault tolerant computing","autonomic network capability;autonomic violation prevention system;network accessible computer system;network intrusion prevention system;proof of concept prototype;security policy;self protection capability;system administration;teleworking;virtual environment;virtual system","","1","","41","","","4-8 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Detection of cyber intrusions using network-based multicast messages for substation automation","Junho Hong; Chen-Ching Liu; Govindarasu, M.","Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT), 2014 IEEE PES","20140519","2014","","","1","5","This paper proposes a new network-based cyber intrusion detection system (NIDS) using multicast messages in substation automation systems (SASs). The proposed network-based intrusion detection system monitors anomalies and malicious activities of multicast messages based on IEC 61850, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Value (SV). NIDS detects anomalies and intrusions that violate predefined security rules using a specification-based algorithm. The performance test has been conducted for different cyber intrusion scenarios (e.g., packet modification, replay and denial-of-service attacks) using a cyber security testbed. The IEEE 39-bus system model has been used for testing of the proposed intrusion detection method for simultaneous cyber attacks. The false negative ratio (FNR) is the number of misclassified abnormal packets divided by the total number of abnormal packets. The results demonstrate that the proposed NIDS achieves a low fault negative rate.","","","","10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816375","Cyber Security of Substations;GOOSE and SV;Intrusion Detection System;Network Security","Computer security;Educational institutions;IEC standards;Intrusion detection;Substation automation","power engineering computing;security of data;substation automation","FNR;GOOSE;IEC 61850;IEEE 39-bus system model;NIDS;SAS;SV;anomaly detection;cyber security testbed;denial-of-service attacks;false negative ratio;generic object-oriented substation event;low-fault negative rate;misclassified abnormal packets;network-based cyber intrusion detection system;network-based multicast messages;packet modification;predefined security rules;replay;sampled value;simultaneous cyber attacks;specification-based algorithm;substation automation systems","","1","","16","","","19-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This technique can exploit an optimization that many anti-virus systems use to make inserting the malware simple; fortunately, this particular exploit is easy to detect, provided the optimization is not present.
