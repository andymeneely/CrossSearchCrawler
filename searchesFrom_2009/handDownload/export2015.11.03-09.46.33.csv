In addition to the generic methodology, the paper describes the implementation of the Vulnerability & Attack Injector Tool (VAIT) that allows the automation of the entire process. We used this tool to run a set of experiments that demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The experiments include the evaluation of coverage and false positives of an intrusion detection system for SQL Injection attacks and the assessment of the effectiveness of two top commercial web application vulnerability scanners.

Packet classification systems have traditionally been built utilizing Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) due to the high throughput needed. However, TCAMs are expensive in terms of area and power consumption. An alternative to TCAM based systems using SRAM and a novel rule encoding method has been proposed to match multiple packets simultaneously (using multiple store_compare_units). This alternative achieves similar or better throughput than the traditional TCAM approach while occupying smaller space and consuming less energy. This paper revamps the existing SRAM-based architecture to reduce area and power consumption without threatening throughput. Two methods are shown. The first method allows for range encoding SRAMs to be shared between store_compare_units (SCUs) to lower area and power consumption with minor effect on throughput. The second method discusses a hybrid system allowing rules with prefixes (single rules) and ranges (rules which match a range of addresses, usually translated to many prefixes) to exist in parallel for the same domain. This allows for lower power consumption than utilizing fixed range encoding due to optimization of the ruleset. Results show that this hybrid architecture saves more than 20% of power/field if half of the TCP ports contain ranges (and the other half contains prefixes). The new extensions have been tested in over ten benchmarks (including the SNORT ruleset) to verify the claimed improvements.","","978-1-4244-7628-2","","10.1109/NCA.2010.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598235","LOP;Packet Classification;Range Encoding","Australia;Clocks;Encoding;Memory management;Power demand;Random access memory;Throughput","SRAM chips;computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching","SNORT ruleset;SRAM;TCP ports;packet classification system;range encoding;rule encoding;store compare units;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","24","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The routing protocols in MANET are designed on the basis of the assumption that all the participating nodes co-operate with each other. Due to certain issues like open structure and limited energy supply, the nodes sometimes misbehave and act in a selfish manner. 2ACK scheme used as an add-on technique on few routing protocols (e.g. DSR) to detect such misbehaviour for mitigating their adverse effect. The major limitation of this 2ACK scheme is additional routing overhead due to authenticated 2ACK packets. Thus, this research work focuses on reducing the end-to-end delay and routing overhead by modifying the authentication mechanism in 2ACK scheme. The simulation results have been presented for evaluating the performance of the work done.","","978-1-4799-7682-9","","10.1109/PDGC.2014.7030727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030727","2ACK scheme;DSR;MAC;MANETs;selfish node","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Throughput;Wireless communication","cooperative communication;message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication power management","2ACK packets;2ACK scheme;DSR;MANET;authentication mechanism;dynamic source routing;end-to-end delay;energy supply;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;routing overhead;routing protocols;wireless links","","0","","48","","","11-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of computerized systems-including ATM networks, web servers, and intrusion detection systems-systematically track every atomic action we perform, thus generating massive streams of timestamped observation data, possibly from multiple concurrent activities. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently detecting occurrences of high-level activities from such interleaved data streams. A solution to this important problem would greatly benefit a broad range of applications, including fraud detection, video surveillance, and cyber security. There has been extensive work in the last few years on modeling activities using probabilistic models. In this paper, we propose a temporal probabilistic graph so that the elapsed time between observations also plays a role in defining whether a sequence of observations constitutes an activity. We first propose a data structure called “temporal multiactivity graph” to store multiple activities that need to be concurrently monitored. We then define an index called Temporal Multiactivity Graph Index Creation (tMAGIC) that, based on this data structure, examines and links observations as they occur. We define algorithms for insertion and bulk insertion into the tMAGIC index and show that this can be efficiently accomplished. We also define algorithms to solve two problems: the “evidence” problem that tries to find all occurrences of an activity (with probability over a threshold) within a given sequence of observations, and the “identification” problem that tries to find the activity that best matches a sequence of observations. We introduce complexity reducing restrictions and pruning strategies to make the problem-which is intrinsically exponential-linear to the number of observations. Our experiments confirm that tMAGI- has time and space complexity linear to the size of the input, and can efficiently retrieve instances of the monitored activities.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2011.246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095553","Activity detection;indexing;stochastic automata;timestamped data","Automata;Context awareness;Hidden Markov models;Indexing;Monitoring;Stochastic processes","computational complexity;computerised monitoring;data structures;graph theory;probabilistic automata;probability;stochastic automata","concurrent activity monitoring;data structure;evidence problem;high-level activity occurrence detection;identification problem;interleaved data streams;intrinsically exponential problem;space complexity;tMAGIC index;tMAGIC insertion algorithm;temporal multiactivity graph index creation;temporal multiactivity probabilistic graph;temporal stochastic automaton-based activity model indexing;time complexity;timestamped observation data streams","","3","","16","","2011-12-06","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Current techniques support the search for multiple patterns using deterministic or non-deterministic automata. In practice however, the static pattern representation does not fully utilize available system resources, subsequently suffering from poor performance. Therefore a low overhead auto-reconfigurable automaton is needed that optimizes pattern matching performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time. Morpheus uses templates to speed up dynamic automaton reconfiguration. Results from empirical studies confirm the benefits of our approach, with three orders of magnitude improvement achieved in the overall pattern matching performance with the help of dynamic reconfiguration. This is accomplished only with a modest increase in amortized memory usage.","1063-6382","978-1-4673-0042-1","","10.1109/ICDE.2012.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228144","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Dynamic scheduling;Engines;Equations;Optimization;Pattern matching","data structures;deterministic automata;pattern matching;query processing","autoreconfigurable automaton;data stream;database searching;deterministic automata;dynamic automaton reconfiguration;dynamic configuration morphing;massive pattern query optimization;nondeterministic automata;pattern matching;query pattern representation;resource constrained system;static pattern representation","","1","","29","","","1-5 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper aims to survey and classify existing VMI techniques and their applications.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2015.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299979","Intrusion detection;Malware analysis;Memory forensics;Security-as-a-service;Semantic gap;Virtual machine introspection","Hardware;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors","","","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However to perform privacy protection causes huge overhead. Thus it is a critical issue to perform the most suitable protection to decline performance consumption while provide privacy protection. In this paper, the Effective Privacy Protection Scheme (EPPS) is proposed to provide the appropriate privacy protection which is satisfying the user-demand privacy requirement and maintaining system performance simultaneously. At first, we analyze the privacy level users require and quantify security degree and performance of encryption algorithms. Then, an appropriate security composition is derived by the results of analysis and quantified data. Finally, the simulation results show that the EPPS not only fulfills the user-demand privacy but also maintains the cloud system performance in different cloud environments.

In this paper, we attempt to improve on the state of the art by providing a forensic platform that transparently monitors and records data access events within a virtualized environment using only the abstractions exposed by the hypervisor. Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected. We also extend our earlier work by providing a tracking mechanism that can monitor data exfiltration attempts across multiple disks and also block attempts to copy data over the network.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2210217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6248214","Computer security;checkpointing;information security;intrusion detection;operating systems;system recovery;virtual machine monitors","Couplings;Forensics;Monitoring;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","computer forensics;data privacy","computer systems;data access;data exfiltration attempts;data provenance;forensic analysis;forensic layer records;forensic platform;hypervisor;multiple disks;privacy breaches;tracking mechanism;version-based audit log;virtualized environment","","0","","37","","2012-07-24","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The pace of application in the context of wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) has been somewhat impeded, however, by the reluctance of industry to accept the risks of allowing wireless paths to be incorporated in process control loops. The problem is that there are conflicts between maintaining control loop performance, which can be degraded by many factors, such as low data rates, delays in wireless paths, jitter and electromagnetic interference; and the usual objectives in managing a wireless sensor network, namely freedom to configure the network and to adjust data rates at will, to maximize efficiency and to conserve energy consumption in battery-powered network nodes. In the context of developing advanced controls technology for systems with wireless networks in feedback paths there is a strong need for a test environment that can be used to explore all facets of such systems, including potential problems relating to control loop performance and WSN management. We propose to address this requirement by developing a new testbed for research in WNCSs by adding advanced control agents and process simulators from the Intelligent Control and Asset Management or ICAM project to an existing WSN testbed called the Wireless Industrial Sensor Network Testbed for Radio-Harsh Environments or WINTeR. This testbed has been custom developed for oil and gas industrial environments, i.e., it includes features such as electromagnetic interference and complex multipath propagation. The proposed new testbed, hereafter called WINTeR-ICAM, will include the ICAM Supervisor, ICAM Agents and an additional agent to resolve conflicts between maintaining control loop performance and managing the WSN effectively and efficiently, called a WNCS Coordination Agent or WNCSCA. This age- - nt is designed to be part of an intelligent supervisory control system, and to grant the WSN as much latitude in meeting its objectives as possible while maintaining the performance of control loops that incorporate wireless paths, thus adding to the safety and reliability of future WNCSs. Together, the process simulators, ICAM Agents and WINTeR will provide a powerful new environment for research and development of advanced WNCS technology, with WSN hardware and software in the loop; this novel conception is the contribution of this paper.","1553-572X","978-1-4244-5225-5","978-1-4244-5226-2","10.1109/IECON.2010.5675268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5675268","","Actuators;Communication system security;Data models;Delay;Process control;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","networked control systems;telecommunication control;wireless sensor networks","WNCS coordination agent;advanced wireless networked control systems;battery-powered network nodes;data rate factor;electromagnetic interference factor;jitter factor;radio-harsh environments;wireless industrial sensor network testbed;wireless paths delay factor;wireless sensor networks","","3","","25","","","7-10 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns. This paper analyses the role of computational intelligence techniques to design adaptive and cognitive intrusion detection systems that can efficiently detect malicious network activities and proposes novel three-tier archite- ture for designing intelligent intrusion detection systems for wireless networks.","","978-1-4799-1594-1","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724156","IP address;MAC address;Pervasive computing;adaptation;attacks;computational intelligence;intrusion detection;wireless integration","Communication system security;Computational intelligence;IP networks;Internet;Security;Wireless networks","artificial intelligence;computer network security;radiocommunication;ubiquitous computing","3G based Internet communication;Amazon;Internet of Things;banks;business transactions;computational intelligence based intrusion detection systems;computing paradigm;cyber-physical computing;cybercrime;data confidentiality;eBay;malicious intrusions;malware;pervasive computing networks;shopping firms;sophisticated attacks;stock exchanges;wireless communication capability;wireless communication networks","","1","","14","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANETs face security risks and energy consumption. However, conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a MANET becomes a challenging issue because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address this issue, we develop both lossless and lossy aggregation techniques to reduce the energy cost in information transition and bandwidth consumption while preserving the desired detection accuracy. In particular, we develop two lossless aggregation techniques: compression-based and event-based aggregation and develop a lossy aggregation technique: feature-based aggregation. We conduct real-world experiments and simulation study to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed data aggregation techniques in terms of the energy consumption and detection accuracy.","","978-1-4673-3131-9","","10.1109/CCNC.2013.6488430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488430","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring","data compression;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","MANET;bandwidth consumption;compression-based aggregation;computing infrastructure;cyber attack monitoring;data aggregation techniques;energy consumption;energy cost;energy-efficiency;event-based aggregation;feature-based aggregation;host-based intrusion detection;lossless aggregation techniques;lossy aggregation techniques;mobile ad hoc networks;network-centric operation;security risks","","1","","11","","","11-14 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes in MANETs use radio signals with a finite range to communicate making it possible for any intermediate node to intercept the communication. Also the frequently changing topology, with high susceptibility to physical compromise along with the node's limitations in terms of energy resource, storage device and CPU form a tremendous challenge in providing security to MANETs. Unlike wired networks, there is no central infrastructure, which paves way for new challenges as services provided by central entities is now to be ensured by the mobile nodes in the network itself. As a result, there is no definitive form of defense and a comprehensive security solution should encompass avoidance, detection and reaction along with sought-after network performances. This paper focuses on the prevention/proactive approach of securing MANETs using NTRU (N<sup>th</sup> degree truncated polynomial ring), to secure end-to-end communication through data encryption during data transmission. NTRU is Lattice-based cryptography, which is known to be resistant to quantum attacks. We assume a clustered MANET environment i.e. the mobile nodes have an efficient cluster-based routing algorithm deployed which gives us the list of clusters available in the environment along with its cluster heads and competent routing between them. The proposed technique provides data encryption using NTRU between cluster heads.","","978-1-4799-3974-9","","10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238393","Lattice-based cryptography;Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) security;NTRU cryptosystem;efficient cluster-based routing;secure data transmission;secure message transmission","Ad hoc networks;Data communication;Encryption;Mobile computing;Polynomials","cryptography;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET topology;NTRU;Nth degree truncated polynomial ring;cluster-based routing algorithm;data encryption;lattice based secure data transmission;lattice-based cryptography;mobile ad hoc network node;radio signals;wireless communication adapter","","0","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions.

LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm has already been proven as the most promising outlier detection method for detecting network intrusions. To improve the performance of detection, LOF needs a complete set of normal behaviors of business applications, which is usually not available in cloud computing. We present an adaptive anomaly detection scheme for cloud computing based on LOF. Our scheme learns behaviors of applications both in training and detecting phase. It is adaptive to the change during detecting. The adaptability of our scheme reduces demand of efforts on collecting training data before detecting.

First, devices capable of detecting intrusions on high-speed links of 10 Gbps and higher are rather expensive, or must be built based on complex arrays. Second, legislation commonly restricts the way in which backbone network operators can analyse the data in their networks. To overcome these constraints, flow-based intrusion detection can be applied, which traditionally focuses only on packet header fields and packet characteristics.

A grand challenge in this situation is that current management is inflexible and the security resource utilization is not efficient. The flexible deployment and utilization of proper security devices at reasonable places at needed time with low management cost is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new concept of network security virtualization, which virtualizes security resources/functions to network administrators/users, and thus maximally utilizing existing security devices/middle-boxes. In addition, it enables security protection to desirable networks with minimal management cost. To verify this concept, we further design and implement a prototype system, NETSECVISOR, which can utilize existing pre-installed (fixed-location) security devices and leverage software-defined networking technology to virtualize network security functions. At its core, NETSECVISOR contains: 1) a simple script language to register security services and policies; 2) a set of routing algorithms to determine optimal routing paths for different security policies based on different needs; and 3) a set of security response functions/strategies to handle security incidents. We deploy NETSECVISOR in both virtual test networks and a commercial switch environment to evaluate its performance and feasibility. The evaluation results show that our prototype only adds a very small overhead while providing desired network security virtualization to network users/administrators.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2453936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152892","Security;Software-Defined Networking;Virtualization;software-defined networking;virtualization","Communication networks;Monitoring;Prototypes;Routing;Security;Switches;Virtualization","computer network management;computer network security;software defined networking;virtualisation","NETSECVISOR prototype system;commercial switch environment;first step toward network security virtualization;fixed-location security devices;low management cost;network security devices;network security management;security policy;security protection;security resource utilization;security response functions;software-defined networking technology;virtual test networks","","0","","37","","2015-07-08","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful network intrusion detection system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement.

The main idea of the method is network traffic is analyzed and estimated by using Relative Entropy Theory (RET), and a network anomaly detection model based on RET is designed as well. The numerical value of relative entropy is used to alleviate the inherent contradictions between improving detection rate and reducing false alarm rate, which is more precise and can effectively reduce the error of estimation.

Access controls are used to protect against malicious attacks and to ensure that established database privileges are not misused. Intrusion detection systems can augment these controls by alerting the intrusion response team after an attack has occurred. While intrusion detection can assist forensic analysis, a passive response to detection can permit the inflicted damage to go undetected for a long period of time, allowing the damage to potentially propagate. In contrast, we propose an adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system to secure the database from attacks. The approach requires the database to learn the activities considered normal using training data taken from production. The model adapts to stringent variations of the training data while in operation, reducing the potential for normal activities to be misclassified as malicious.","","","","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974450","Database;Database Security;Intrusion Prevention Systems;Security Algorithms","Databases;Intrusion detection;Production;Semantics;Syntactics;Training data","authorisation;data protection;database management systems;digital forensics","access controls;adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system;database privileges;database roles;database security;fine-grained object access;forensic analysis;inflicted damage;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response team;malicious attacks protection;virtual private databases","","0","","18","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method focuses on malwares which impersonate a legitimate process by injecting malicious codes into the process. This method extracts two process images.

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997497","","Automatic generation control;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Smart grids","power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;smart power grids","ACE;AGC;Markov models;area control error;automatic generation control;data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system;legacy energy infrastructures;short-term adaptive predictor;smart grid","","0","","20","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensor nodes placed in remote areas require less attention and supervision, but require significant battery power to survive long periods of time. Recharging or replacing batteries are difficult since units are often placed in areas which are difficult to access. Hence this technology requires sensor nodes to be as autonomic as possible where the nodes should be able to manage themselves without human intervention. We proposed a new mobile agent based energy efficient, self-healing framework for a sensor network. The proposed framework will be implemented in a real world prototype specifically providing detection of illegal entry to designated areas. Such an application might be useful in regulating cross-boundary passage of illegal immigrants to Malaysia. Wireless sensor remote monitoring may offer advantages over current remote monitoring systems in Malaysia, which utilize satellite transmission primarily.

However, research on security metrics has been hindered by difficulties in handling zero-day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities has been considered as something unmeasurable due to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because a more secure configuration would be of little value if it were equally susceptible to zero-day attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting to rank unknown vulnerabilities, our metric counts how many such vulnerabilities would be required for compromising network assets; a larger count implies more security because the likelihood of having more unknown vulnerabilities available, applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will be significantly lower. We formally define the metric, analyze the complexity of computing the metric, devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and finally demonstrate through case studies that applying the metric to existing network security practices may generate actionable knowledge.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529081","Security metrics;attack graph;network hardening;network security","","computer network security","computational complexity;heuristic algorithms;k zero day safety;network security metric;software flaws","","2","","43","","2013-06-11","Jan.-Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the threat called security vulnerabilities is being faced on the other side. The damages suffered from such a threat are personal information leakage, unreasonable charging, root permission acquisition and so on. In addition, it is said that Android, which is considered as the most vulnerable operating system among the smart devices' operating systems, has the greatest damage of malware codes. Accordingly, this paper proposes a technique to detect malicious codes based on Android devices by using the multivariate time-series analysis. A variety of resource information is integrated into a resource to organize data, and an autoregressive moving average model of the time-series models is used to carry out the modeling. The modeled data is matched with real data to detect malicious codes.

We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner. Based on the duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium.

Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix. Using the information in Alert Correlation Matrix, we can extract high level attack strategies and construct attack graphs.

As a scalable and parameter-free unsupervised AD technique, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm has attracted a lot of attention for its applications in computer networks and WSNs. However, the nature of lazy-learning makes the kNN-based AD schemes difficult to be used in an online manner, especially when communication cost is constrained. In this paper, a new kNN-based AD scheme based on hypergrid intuition is proposed for WSN applications to overcome the lazy-learning problem. Through redefining anomaly from a hypersphere detection region (DR) to a hypercube DR, the computational complexity is reduced significantly. At the same time, an attached coefficient is used to convert a hypergrid structure into a positive coordinate space in order to retain the redundancy for online update and tailor for bit operation. In addition, distributed computing is taken into account, and position of the hypercube is encoded by a few bits only using the bit operation. As a result, the new scheme is able to work successfully in any environment without human interventions. Finally, the experiments with a real WSN data set demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and robust.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295612","Complexity theory;Detectors;Encoding;Monitoring;Real time systems;Training data;Wireless sensor network;Wireless sensor networks;anomaly detection;distributed computing;k-nearest neighbor;parameter selection","Complexity theory;Detectors;Encoding;Monitoring;Real time systems;Training data;Wireless sensor networks","computational complexity;hypercube networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","WSN;communication cost;computational complexity;computer network;cyberattack protection;distributed computing;hypercube DR;hypersphere detection region;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;lazy-learning problem;parameter-free unsupervised AD technique;positive coordinate space;random fault protection;scalable hypergrid k-NN-based online anomaly detection;wireless sensor network","","8","","30","","2012-09-05","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we advocate content parsing to empower SDN with finer grained control ability over traffic. Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA).

Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace. When comparing with other six approaches on the real traces, COPY performs 4.2Gb/s and 24.7Gb/s with single- and eight-thread models, respectively, which improves 20%-860% than others, and consumes acceptable offline overhead in time and space.","","","","10.1109/ANCS.2015.7110120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110120","","Accuracy;Automata;Grammar;Payloads;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Semantics","automata theory;context-free grammars;program compilers;programming language semantics;protocols;software defined networking","COPY;DCA;DCCFG;SDN;application layer protocols;commodity hardware;content parsing;distinguishable counting automaton;distinguishable counting context free grammar;protocol semantics;software defined networking","","0","","38","","","7-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been necessitated that the need for visual analysis within an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is to identify these flood-attack patterns. The challenges are how to increase the accuracy of detection and how to visualize and present flood attack patterns in networks for early detection. In this paper, we propose a Two-Layer density model for flood attack detection. The first density layer describes sending-density and receiving-density in analyzing Internet traffic. The second density layer describes attack-density and normal-density in analyzing local network traffic at a victim site. Several visualization techniques are used to facilitate the detection process. The experiments demonstrate that the Two-Layer density model has significantly improved the accuracy of the detection of flood attacks and provides users with a better understanding of the nature of flood attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICCSNT.2013.6967191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967191","Network security;attack density;flood attack pattern;information visualization;receiving density;sending density","Computer hacking;Floods;Joining processes;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic;Visualization","Internet;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;attack-density;first density layer;flood attack pattern visualization;intrusion detection system;local network traffic;normal-density;receiving-density;sending-density;two-layer density model;victim site","","0","","16","","","12-13 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such, paper-based invoices may still be issued along with e-invoices, contradicting an important benefit of e-invoicing - paper consumption reduction. Thanks to the advances in smart phones and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies, e-invoices can be delivered via NFC-enabled smartpones, allowing consumers to examine the content immediately after transactions and to easily retrieve them later on. Still, an extra security mechanism is needed to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of the content, as invoices may bear some value and thus become the target of a security attack. In this paper, we propose a secure NFC-based e-invoice remitting scheme using standard NFC P2P communications, and discuss how it fulfills major security requirements, including authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation.

GATS integrates the concept of tabu list which may increase local search performance. Then, an incremental SVM with reserved set method (R-ISVM) is developed to deal with the problem of intrusion detection.

One of the most important applications of decision making is in the field of anomaly detection. This can enable the detection of attacks in cyber-physical systems without requiring a complete description of the physical process. The novelty of our approach is that is combines reports of various cyber and physical sensors, rather than focusing on either one single metric, or one singe realm, as was the case of similar techniques.

It improves the performance of Intrusion Detection System for detecting the fragmented and Out-of-Order packet attack.","","978-1-4673-2906-4","","10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466108","Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA);Intrusion Detection System(IDS);Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU);Network Intrusion Detection Syterm(NIDS)","Automata;Computers;Doped fiber amplifiers;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Silicon","pattern matching;security of data","IP datagram;fragmented attack detection;fragmented packet streams;intrusion detection system;multiple fragmentation techniques;network media;out-of-order packet attack detection;out-of-order packet streams;packet size combinations;pattern matching technique;regular expression matching;security device","","0","","11","","","4-6 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the basic SIP specifications do not require the proxy servers to track the states of established sessions, an extension header field ""Session-Expires"" has been proposed for SIP to allow the proxy server to hold resources for established sessions just within the specified periods. In this paper, we identify a novel denial of service (DoS) attack utilizing this SIP extension to drain resources of the proxy servers in wireless VoIP. In particular, by deliberately setting a large value of the ""Session-Expires'' header and then physically disconnecting from the wireless network, attackers can repeatedly hold resources of the proxy server as long as they want. Also, the low-volume nature of the attack allows it to avoid being detected by existing volume-based intrusion detection systems. As a counter-measure, we propose a robust detection scheme based on the statistical Anderson-Darling test. The key insight that leads to the scheme is the changed statistical property of the header values induced by the attack. We validate the performance through computer simulation. The scheme shows its ability to detect the attack and is even more effective when applied against the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684028","","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Robustness;Servers;Wireless networks","Internet telephony;signalling protocols;statistical testing;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;SIP-based wireless VoIP network;Session Initiation Protocol;attack detection;distributed denial of service attack;proxy server;resource-drained attack;session control;session management;session-expires;statistical Anderson-Darling test;statistical property;volume-based intrusion detection system","","2","","12","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attacks on distributed systems grow stronger and more prevalent each and every day. Intrusion detection methods are a key to control and potentially eradicate attacks on a system. An Intrusion detection system pertains to the methods used to identify an attack on a computer or computer network. In cloud computing environment the applications are user-centric and the customers should be confident about their applications stored in the cloud server. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) plays an important role in providing the network security. They provide a defence layer which monitors the network traffic for pre-defined suspicious activity or pattern. In this paper Snort, Tcpdump and Network Flight Recorder which are the most famous NIDS in cloud system are examined and contrasted.","","978-1-4577-1580-8","","10.1109/ICCCI.2012.6158820","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158820","Network Flight Recorder (NFR);Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS);Snort;Tcpdump","Computers;Engines;Filtering;Histograms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protocols","cloud computing;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Snort;Tcpdump;attackers;cloud computing environment;computer networks;defence layer;distributed systems;intruders;network flight recorder;network intrusion detection systems;network security;network traffic monitoring","","5","","19","","","10-12 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because transportation infrastructure may be unusable, aerial assessments are the gold standard by which such assessments are performed. The advent of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and autonomous aircraft represents a unique opportunity to allow for rapid response, while minimizing the cost of deployment and increasing reliability and operator safety. This paper describes the key challenges to implement fault-tolerant and efficient deployments of collaborative autonomous aircraft to increase operational reliability and performance when performing aerial sensing and assessment. Some challenges are introduced by mobility, such as wireless communication, group navigation, and data collection. Security also represents a challenge during the operation of the MANET. We consider the effects of limited resources (e.g., real-time processing power, battery packs) available on the aircraft. By understanding both the application context and the resource availability, networked aircraft can reorganize to ensure resiliency for the mission if a resource failure occurs within the network.","","978-1-4673-5287-1","978-1-4673-5286-4","10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504199","Energy efficiency;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad-hoc networks;Robust and secure wireless communication;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","Aircraft;Aircraft navigation;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Routing;Security","aircraft communication;cost reduction;disasters;fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","MANET aerial communication;aerial assessment performance;aerial sensing performance;autonomous aircraft deployment;cost minimization;data collection;fault-tolerant;group navigation;mobile ad-hoc network;natural disaster;operational reliability;operator safety;radio receiver;real-time processing power;resource availability;resource failure network;search-rescue application;security;transportation infrastructure;wireless communication","","2","","23","","","28-31 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The devices of SAS with remote-control functions are one of the main target of cyber attack. The vulnerability assessment for communication network of SASs that supporting the analysis of control process, is an unsolved problem. Combined with the characteristics of SAS and the vulnerability assessment of the distributed systems, a vulnerability assessment method for communication nework of SASs to cyber attack is proposed. The substation communication system has been classified into six basic models used to construct vulnerability state graph (VSG). The vulnerability of single action is defined based on exponential distribution function including parameters called vulnerability factor and equivalent attacking cost, and then the vulnerability value of target systems are calculated by four connection types of VSG. Furthermore, a vulnerability factor quantity method based on AHP-TOPSIS is designed. An evaluation instance is constructed from IEC 61850 standard, the proposed method is applicable to evaluate the vulnerability of communication network of SASs.","","978-1-4244-3810-5","978-1-4244-3811-2","10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840141","analytic hierarchy process;communication system;information security;substation automation;vulnerability state graph","Automatic control;Communication networks;Communication system control;Cost function;Exponential distribution;IEC standards;Power system control;Process control;Substation automation;Synthetic aperture sonar","power distribution control;substation automation;telecontrol","IEC 61850 standard;communication network;control process analysis;distributed systems;power system control;remote-control functions;substation automation systems;substation communication system;vulnerability assessment method;vulnerability state graph","","2","","21","","","15-18 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method builds on existing statistical-based detection, but it uses a two-stage neural network to process the data and identify the peer-to-peer connections. A full architecture is also proposed to link the detection with a module producing ACL rules allowing segregating and blocking or shaping the peer-to-peer traffic in real time.
