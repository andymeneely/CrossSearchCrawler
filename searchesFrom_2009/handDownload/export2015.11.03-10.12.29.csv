"Intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system using wireless sensor actuator network","Ghatak, S.; Bose, S.; Roy, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Netaji Subhash Eng.

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.","","978-1-4799-2353-3","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795","IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network","","0","","14","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Facing new application scenarios in cloud computing, the IDS approaches yield several problems since the operator of the IDS should be the user, not the administrator of the cloud infrastructure. Extensibility, efficient management, and compatibility to virtualization-based context need to be introduced into many existing IDS implementations.Additionally, the cloud providers need to enable possibilities to deploy and configure IDS for the user.

However, the complexity of traditional method for generating attack graphs increases dramatically as the network size grows. To solve this problem, the efficiency of attack graph generation method must be improved. Based on the analysis of generation approaches to attack graphs, an attack graph generation method for complex network is proposed in this paper. In this method, the network framework and key nodes can be analyzed and searched by loopholes scanning firstly.

Then, we propose a threat model for smart meters. Considering the constrained computation and storage resources of a smart meter, we present a collaborative intrusion detection mechanism against false data injection attack. The proposed scheme can work regardless of changes in a smart meter's software. Numerical results demonstrate the low cost and effectiveness of our proposed intrusion detection mechanism.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2418280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087397","Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI);collaborative intrusion detection;colored Petri net;smart grid;smart meters;spying domain;threat model","Intrusion detection;Memory management;Smart grids;Smart meters;Software;Writing","Petri nets;power engineering computing;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","AMI;advanced metering infrastructure;collaborative intrusion detection mechanism;colored Petri net;false data injection attack;information flows;smart meters;smart power grid","","0","","44","","2015-04-16","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The ANN is trained on the recorded data - voltage, current and ambient temperature, to produce a non-linear model and to accurately predict the state of charge (SOC) of the battery. The SOC prediction is based on the recent behavior of the battery. Preliminary experimental results using recorded datasets from the battery design studio are presented for the lithium ion battery.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490","","Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The two most common implementations of Pattern matching are based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), which take the payload of a packet as an input string. In this paper, we propose an efficient NFA-based pattern matching in Binary Content Addressable Memory(BCAM), which uses data search words consisting of 1s and 0s. Our approach can process multiple characters at a time using limited BCAM entries, which makes our approach scalable well.

In this proof-of-concept study, a new scan detection technique is demonstrated that also improves our understanding of Internet traffic. Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan. The data is stored in an efficient manner, allowing activity information to be retained for very long periods of time.

These problems are emphasized when dealing with complex or parallel programs. This paper presents a new approach to automatically generate a dedicated and customized IDS from C sources targeting multi-threaded programs. We use Petri Nets to benefit from a formal description able to compactly describe parallel behaviors.

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols. Advantages and Disadvantages have also been described in existing techniques to carry out research in this problem.","","978-1-4577-1385-9","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075132","Attacks;DDoS;IP Spoofing;IP Traceback;Zombies","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Probabilistic logic","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDOS attacks;IP routing;IP spoofing;IP traceback;Internet connection;Internet security;compromised hosts;distributed denial-of-service;router functions;traceback techniques","","3","","22","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We reduced the number of inputs while keeping IDS systems high detection rates.

Hierarchical methods are more efficient for this. Apart from achieving energy efficiency, the load on balancing and security are essential.

This algorithm operates on the KDD-99 Data set; this data set is used worldwide for evaluating the performance of different intrusion detection systems.

In most of the cases the latter are cyber attackers with financial motivations, and malicious software with the ability to launch automated attacks. Honeypots are usually deployed as either production systems or as research units to study the methods employed by attackers. In this paper we present the results of two distinct research honeypots. The first acted as a malware collector, a device usually deployed in order to capture self-propagating malware and monitor their activity. The second acted as a decoy server, dropping but logging every malicious connection attempt. Both of these systems have remained online for a lengthy period of time to study the aforementioned malicious activity. During this assessment it was shown that human attackers and malicious software are constantly attacking servers, trying to break into systems or spread across networks. It was also shown that the usage of honeypots for malware monitoring and attack logging can be very effective and provide valuable data. Lastly, we present an open source visualization tool which was developed to help security professionals and researchers during the analysis and conclusion drawing phases, for use with one of the systems fielded in our study.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883587","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883587","data visualization;honeypot;intrusion detection;log file analysis;malware","Data visualization;Grippers;IP networks;Malware;Ports (Computers);Servers;Software","data visualisation;invasive software;public domain software","cyber attackers;financial motivations;honeypots deployment;malicious connections;malicious software;malware activity;open source visualization tool;threat agents","","0","","30","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address the intrusion detection problem in heterogeneous networks consisting of nodes with different noncorrelated security assets. In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment. We also show how our game theoretical framework can be applied to configure the intrusion detection strategies in realistic scenarios via a case study. Finally, we evaluate the proposed game theoretical framework via simulations. The simulation results show both the correctness of the analytical results and the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2019154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815406","Game theory;Nash equilibrium (NE);intrusion detection system (IDS)","","game theory;security of data","Nash equilibrium;game theoretical analysis;heterogeneous networks;intrusion detection systems;noncooperative game;optimal strategy;security infrastructure","","17","","14","","2009-04-17","June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This attacker-driven anti-malware testing is something defenders would ideally want to limit. Given that anti-malware products must be widely distributed to be commercially viable, it is not feasible to prevent attackers from running them. Here we examine whether it may be possible to instead limit the effectiveness of attacker tests. Specifically, we present a game-theoretic model of anti-malware testing where detection timeliness and coverage are parameters that can be adjusted by anti-malware providers. The less coverage and the slower the response, the harder it is for attackers to determine whether their malware will be detected-and the less protection the software provides to hosts running the anti-malware software. While our results are preliminary, they suggest that it is clearly non-optimal for anti-malware vendors to simply maximize coverage and detection time. As we explain, this result has significant implications for product design and (non-malicious) anti-malware testing methodologies.","","","","10.1109/WATeR.2014.7015755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015755","","Computers;Game theory;Games;Malware;Software;Testing","invasive software;product design","antimalware products;antimalware software;attacker-driven antimalware testing;detection coverage;detection timeliness;game-theoretic model;malware author testing challenge;product design","","0","","16","","","23-23 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a first step, the states are defined using clustering techniques for the network traffic profiles; secondly state transition probability matrix and initial probability distribution are determined based on the states defined. Based on the network states, the probability of event occurrence is stochastically measured if the value is lesser than the predefined probability then it event is predicted as anomaly.

This thesis proposes a new approach to OS discovery which addresses the limitations of existing tools and leads to a more flexible, less intrusive, and much more accurate tool. Moreover, unlike existing OSD tools which are completely ad hoc, our approach is formal and follows the principles of diagnosis problem solving. This formalism allows us to: (a) characterize the complexity of OSD; (b) use well-tested algorithms and (c) benefit from numerous possible extensions. To fully address the needs of OSD, we generalize the theory of diagnosis with a query-based extension. This extension leads to a spectrum of test selection algorithms to solve each query.","1542-1201","978-1-4673-0267-8","978-1-4673-0268-5","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6212000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212000","","Accuracy;Computers;Context;Engines;Knowledge based systems;Operating systems;Security","operating systems (computers);problem solving;program diagnostics;program testing;query processing","OSD complexity;diagnosis problem solving principles;diagnosis theory;operating system discovery tools;query-based extension;test selection algorithms","","2","","16","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we examine the applicability of a cooperative architecture regarding forecasts of UIT on a more complex set-up, with hosts associated with sites geographically divided. The aim of this paper is to detail the employment of EWMA and Fibonacci forecasting techniques covering three major gaps of current prediction techniques concerning UIT: sensors employment, the use of just one prediction technique and forecasts' sharing.

"An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis","Xinming Ou; Rajagopalan, S.R.; Sakthivelmurugan, S.","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2009. ACSAC '09. Annual","20100115","2009","","","494","503","Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3919-5","","10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706","intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;security of data","Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty","","3","","22","","","7-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, requested time intervals and requested IPs with text mining are used for user profiles.

Evading these attacks has created a lot of attention from researchers. A number of monitoring and filtering devices have been developed to verify the authenticity of the packets based on the packet payload data in intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the methods used for IDS cannot be deployed in DDoS filters since in DDoS attacks, a lot of packets arrive in a short span of time and deriving packet payload patterns become cumbersome with these IDS algorithms. This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm. This three-level filter was tested in the ANTS active network tool kit with the 1999 DARPA IDS dataset as the back end. Results validate the proposed scheme's efficiency and the time complexity of the filter proposed is smaller than IDS payload scanning methodologies.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809140","ANTS;Anomaly detection;Distributed Denial of Service attack;Eigen Vector;Payload modeling;String matching","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Filtering;Filters;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;message authentication;string matching;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;active network;distributed denial-of-service attack;eigen vector;flooding attack;intrusion detection system;optimal string matching algorithm;packet authenticity;packet payload data;payload driven security model","","1","1","11","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The unseen information in such databases is not feasible to mine without efficient mining techniques for extracting information. In past years many algorithms are created to extract knowledge from large sets of data. There are many different methodologies to approach data mining: classification, clustering, association rule, etc. Classification is the most conventional technique to analyse the large data sets. Classification can help identify intrusions, as well as for discovering new and unknown types of intrusions. For classification, feature selection provides an efficient mechanism to analyse the dataset. We are trying to analyse the NSL-KDD cup 99, dataset using various classification algorithms. Primary experiments are performed in WEKA environment. The accuracy of the various algorithms is also calculated. A feature selection method has been implemented to provide improved accuracy. The main objective of this analysis is to deliver the broad analysis feature selection methods for NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset.","","978-1-4799-6928-9","","10.1109/CICN.2014.179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065599","Feature selection;Intrusion detection;KDD cup 99;WEKA","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection","data analysis;data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","DDoS;KDD-99 data set;NSL-KDD cup 99;NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset;WEKA environment;association rule methodology;classification methodology;clustering methodology;databases;feature selection;information extraction;large data set analysis;mining techniques","","0","","32","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Efficient Network Monitoring in Enterprise Data Networks Using Node Capabilities","Sasidharan, S.","Product Eng., Infosys Technol.

International Symposium on","20100108","2009","","","1","4","In modern day data networks, with the increased focus on aspects like network security, band-width optimization and intrusion detection, network monitoring has become an integral part of network design. This paper discusses a method for accelerating the network policing using node capabilities. Presently network monitoring requires the hardware component regeneration tap for packet duplication and this component needs to be present in several network points. The above tap will do un-conditional packet duplication which is in-efficient. This also makes the analyzing devices do overwork in inspecting the packets. This paper thus brings out some of the in-efficiencies in the existing network monitoring systems and justifies an alternate method for doing the same. It presents a suggestive fresh view on the factors that could prove instrumental in improving monitoring of enterprise data networks by re-using some of the forwarding capabilities in the network nodes. The material also attempts to provide an extended outlook on the immense possibilities offered by the new method.","","978-1-4244-5272-9","","10.1109/CNMT.2009.5374596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374596","","Engines;Filters;Intrusion detection;Mirrors;Network servers;Pattern analysis;Probes;Remote monitoring;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","business communication;computer network security;packet switching","enterprise data networks;hardware component regeneration TAP;network monitoring systems;node capabilities;packet duplication","","0","","6","","","18-20 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to the actual situation, we use an evaluation model proposed by us to evaluate the performance of intrusion detection systems. We establish the impact of intrusion detection system index system, corresponding to get observational data of the second order indexes. Evaluation model is a kind of generalized linear regression model with convex constraint, in which the dependent variable is unknown and regression coefficients all are calculated in accordance with samples instead of the prior designated. The least squares estimation of the model is given by the interactive projection algorithm between the convex sets, so as to provide a new analysis method for venture capital evaluation index system.","","978-1-4577-0817-6","978-0-7695-4449-6","10.1109/ICGEC.2011.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042790","Intrusion detection system;evaluation model;interactive projection algorithm;least squares estimation","Bismuth;Computational modeling;Data models;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model","least squares approximations;performance index;regression analysis;security of data;venture capital","convex constraint;convex sets;generalized linear regression model;interactive projection algorithm;intrusion detection system;intrusion detection system index system;least squares estimation;performance evaluation;venture capital evaluation index system","","0","","7","","","Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper aims at utilizing potential benefits from applying distributed multiagent technology to network security. To facilitate information exchange between different agents in our proposed hybrid layered multiagent architecture, a low-cost and low response time agent communication protocol is developed to tackle the issues typically associated with a distributed multiagent system, such as poor system performance, excessive processing power requirement, and long delays. The bandwidth and response time performance of the proposed end-to-end system is investigated through the simulation of the proposed agent communication protocol on our private LAN testbed called Hierarchical Agent Network for Intrusion Detection Systems (HAN-IDS). The simulation results show that our proposed system is efficient and extensible since it consumes negligible bandwidth with low cost and low response time.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-4000-9","978-0-7695-3638-5","10.1109/AINA.2009.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076193","Agent Architecture;Agent Communication;IDS;KQML","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Costs;Delay;Information security;Intrusion detection;Multiagent systems;Power system security;Protocols;Technology management","local area networks;multi-agent systems;protocols;security of data","communication protocol;hybrid layered multiagent architecture;network intrusion detection systems;network security","","0","","20","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
