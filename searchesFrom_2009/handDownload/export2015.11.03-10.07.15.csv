In this environment the mobility of a node is unpredictable; this is considered as a characteristic of wireless networks. Because of faulty or malicious nodes, the network is vulnerable to routing misbehavior. The resource constrained characteristics of MANETs leads to increased query delay at the time of data access. In this paper, AntHocNet+Security (ANTSEC) framework is proposed that includes an enhanced cooperative caching scheme embedded with artificial immune system. This framework improves security by injecting immunity into the data packets, improves the packet delivery ratio and reduces end-to-end delay using cross layer design.

In this paper, an effective feature selection approach based on Bayesian Network classifier is proposed. And with the same intrusion detection benchmark dataset (NSL-KDD), the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated and compared with other commonly used feature selection methods. It is shown by empirical results that features selected by our approach have decreased the time to detect attacks and increased the classification accuracy as well as the true positive rates significantly.","","","","10.1109/NAS.2013.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665383","BayesNet;NSL-KDD;feature selection;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Classification algorithms;Conferences;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection","belief networks;pattern classification;security of data","Bayesian network classifier;IDS efficiency;NSL-KDD dataset;classification accuracy;feature selection approach;network data processing;network intrusion detection","","1","","30","","","17-19 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computing these metrics using a sample of the trace could potentially save precious time. In this paper, we examine several sampling methods to discover their effects on measurement of the privacy-utility tradeoff when anonymizing network traces. We tested the relative accuracy of several packet and flow-sampling methods on existing privacy and utility metrics. We concluded that, for our test trace, no single sampling method we examined allowed us to accurately measure the tradeoff, and that some sampling methods can produce grossly inaccurate estimates of those values.

The cloud computing has lended many user friendly features in terms of various services available through internet but the harsh reality about cloud computing is that they are prone to security threat attacks. One of the major concerning security threats is called Distributed Denial of service attack (DDOS). DDOS attack destroys the ability of the system to provide service by overwhelming the bandwidth of network device and saturating the computation resources of service provider. This paper describes experimental analysis of impact of flooding DDOS attack in cloud environment through simulation in cloudsim. In this experiment we will be defining Infrastructure as service (IaaS) in cloudsim and this IaaS will be deployed in Eucalyptus cloud suite.

Substation critical cyber assets are isolated in electronic security perimeters using firewalls. In this paper a retrofit data logger solution for serial communication based MODBUS and DNP3 network appliances is offered. The retrofit data logger allows existing control systems to be updated to log network transactions in support of substation based network intrusion detection. Substation based intrusion detection supports a defense in depth approach to cyber security in which multiple overlapping layers of security are used to protect critical cyber assets. The data logger is an embedded bump-in-the-wire retrofit device which captures, time stamps, cryptographically signs, encrypts, and store network traffic.

The network conditions like topology, node density, energy constraint makes difficult to decide which protocol suits best for the scenario. The routing in MANETs exploits Proactive and Reactive Routing. Proactive routing provides better packet delivery while Reactive routing has low overheads. Thus, Hybrid routing approach is needed to carry out the routing using both proactive and reactive approaches. The paper proposes a Hybrid Routing algorithm which utilizes the benefits of both reactive and proactive routing in MANETs. The protocol mainly focuses on trust factor of the node which uses frequency of the node and number of retransmissions from the node. The protocol changes its behavior according to different applications in MANETs.","","978-1-4799-8889-1","","10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7148405","Frequency;MANETs;Trust factor","Ad hoc networks;Cache memory;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing","MANET node trust factor;hybrid routing algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;proactive routing protocol;reactive routing protocol;routing attacks","","0","","15","","","15-16 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper concerns using Computational intelligence based learning machines for intrusion detection in hierarchical order of attacking scenarios, which is a problem of general interest to transportation infrastructure protection since a necessary task thereof is to protect the computers responsible for the infrastructure's operational control, and an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy. Hence we use SVM for our proposed Hierarchical Feature reduction for intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396095","DOS;IDS;PSO;Probe;R2l;U2R;support vector machine","Accuracy;Hafnium compounds;Optimization;Subspace constraints","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines","ANN;Artificial Neural Networks;HAB-IDS;HFO-ANID;IDS;SVM;Support Vector Machines;anomaly based intrusion detection systems;attack scenario;computational intelligence based learning machines;hierarchical feature optimization;network security;problem solving;transportation infrastructure protection","","0","","27","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date. In addition to providing fault diagnosis approaches for the linear blocks in the encryption and the decryption of the CLEFIA, error detection approaches are presented for the nonlinear S-boxes, applicable to their composite-field implementations as well as their lookup table realizations. Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision. We conclude our paper with properties and recommendations for IDSs working for WSNs and some future works.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296068","Energy consumption;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Byzantine generals problem;IDS;WSN lifetime;attack detection;encryption;environmental data monitoring;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network lifetime;oral message algorithm;prevention measures;security challenges;spatial distributed autonomous sensors;wireless sensor network","","0","","42","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although some solutions for saving the IPv4 shortage problem, like NAT or CIDR, were applied, the best way for solving the IPv4 shortage is using IPv6 addresses. Because the protocol between the IPv4 and IPv6 address is not compatible, the dual stack solution may be needed to support IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Hence, the organization facing the threats from both IPv4 and IPv6 networks will be a critical issue. In this paper, we proposed a light-weight penetration test tool for IPv6 threats to detect vulnerability in the network environment. In the proposed system, we first use common IPv6 attack tool to generate IPv6 attack signatures to attack a virtual victim.

AICI '09. International Conference on","20100112","2009","1","","15","18","Intrusion detection technology is a key research direction in information technology. For intrusion detection method based support vector machine (SVM), there is a big obstacle that the amount of audit data for modeling is very large even for a small network scale, so it's impractical to directly train SVM using original training datasets. Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance. So it is worth applying and popularizing.","","978-1-4244-3835-8","978-0-7695-3816-7","10.1109/AICI.2009.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5375980","extension clustering;intrusion detection;support vector machine","Artificial intelligence;Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Delay;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","security of data;support vector machines","extension clustering support vector machine;intrusion detection algorithm;response time","","0","","13","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538","Keywords—Local monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.","Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication","","6","","39","","2010-12-30","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Detecting anomalies is hence critical both to protect against misuse and attacks, but is subject to constraints. These include primarily efficiency, but also legal and contractual restrictions limiting the depth of intrusiveness, which can be achieved by an intrusion detection system. In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients. In this paper we therefore propose to monitor system calls at the VM host level without requiring any instrumentation within VMs and argue that this level of granularity is sufficient to capture a number of relevant attack classes. This, together with the efficiency and efficacy of the approach is shown through experiments and statistical analysis in a Linux KVM-based reference scenario.

However, due to huge amounts of log files in large-scale IPTV system, it is not easy to perform deep analysis for various metrics on time. The volume of log data is expected to increase rapidly because of the explosive growth of users. For the efficient management of analysis jobs for diverse metrics under a large set of log data, in this paper, we propose MapReduce-based IPTV log analysis methods on the cloud computing platform, called Hadoop.

Many diverse, mission-critical applications are deployed, including military, rescue, healthcare, factory floor, and smart homes. Security is a fundamental requirement in such sensitive applications in order to ensure their reliable and stable operation. However, security is a fairly difficult task to achieve. The open nature of the wireless communication, the unrestricted deployment and limitations of WSNs and the existence of a variety of attacks threaten the security of a sensor network. Currently, research efforts have mainly focused on developing prevention and intrusion detection mechanisms in WSNs. Intrusion recovery is also an important aspect of security provisioning that is not given the same attention. Researchers have proposed intrusion recovery protocols to restore the network's operation when an attack is detected. Their designs are mostly based on simplified threat models, making the intrusion recovery countermeasures vulnerable to advanced threat models. Although the network may recover its operation after an attack is detected, it does not mean that the threat is eliminated. For example, a persistent adversary can adapt his intrusion strategy to compromise the deployed recovery countermeasure. This research work evaluates the robustness and reliability of well-known recovery countermeasures in WSNs against persistent adversaries. Evaluation results have shown that existing intrusion recovery solutions are vulnerable and can be exploited under different attack strategies in order to compromise the applied recovery countermeasures, and thus the network. The vulnerability assessment is carried out using ns-2 simulations in an IEEE 802.15.4 network and within the AODV context. Observations derived from the assessment contribute towards future directions that can drive new designs of intrusion recov- - ery protocols in WSNs.","1530-1346","978-1-4577-0680-6","978-1-4577-0678-3","10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983922","WSN security;advanced threat model;intrusion recovery;vulnerability assessment","Computer crime;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Switches;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;protocols;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","AODV context;IEEE 802.15.4 network;WSN;factory floor;healthcare;intrusion recovery countermeasure;ns-2 simulations;pervasive computing;protocols;smart homes;vulnerability assessment;wireless communication;wireless sensor networks","","1","","28","","","June 28 2011-July 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Research has shown that the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can enable distributed application and devices to device communication, even on very resource constrained devices, and thus play an important role for IoT and CPS. In order to realize the vision of Internet of Things, communication between devices must be secured. Security mechanisms for resource constrained devices has attracted much interest from the academic community, where research groups have shown solutions like IPsec, VPN-tunnels, (D)TLS, etc. are feasible to use on this type of networks. However, even though the use of well-known security mechanisms are vital for SOA-based IoT/CPS networks and systems to be protected, they do not provide any fine-grain access control. In this paper, a CoAP-based framework for service-level access control on low-power devices is presented. The framework allows fine grain access control on a per service and method basis. For example, by using this approach a device can allow read/write access to its services to one group of users while only allowing read access to another group. Users without the right credentials are not even allowed to discover available services. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, several implementations are presented together with test results. The aim is to provide a holistic framework for secure SOA-based low power networks comprise by resource constrain devices.","","","","10.1109/IECON.2014.7049308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7049308","","Access control;Authentication;IP networks;Protocols;Servers;Service-oriented architecture","Internet of Things;authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;service-oriented architecture;telecommunication power management","CoAP based Internet of Things;access control framework;authentication framework;available service discovery;constrained application protocol;cyber-physical systems;device communication;fine grain access control;low power device;resource constrain device;right credentials;security mechanisms;service level access control;service oriented architecture","","0","","20","","","Oct. 29 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers. Thus, we conclude that estimating the information entropy and the relevant inference risk using a pre-processor can yield a simpler and more accurate classification tree.","1082-3409","978-1-4244-5619-2","978-0-7695-3920-1","10.1109/ICTAI.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362617","","Artificial intelligence;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Facebook;Information entropy;Information security;Privacy;Protection;Risk analysis;Social network services","decision trees;entropy;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;mobile computing;pattern classification;risk analysis","Web2.0 applications;classification tree analysis;data training;decision tree;information entropy;knowledge representation;large mobile phone field;location-aware application;low-entropy situations;preprocessor;social inference risk estimation method;unwanted social inference function;user privacy","","2","","29","","","2-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper tries to exploit some interesting concepts proposed by the new danger theory to overcome the problems associated with the self and non-self model. That by improving NSA in order to achieve better detection rates by integrating the basic danger concepts. In this approach, the intrusion detection is related to the damage that can occur in the system and that can be caused by both external elements such as internal elements. The proposed algorithm integrates and combines the basic concepts of intrusion detection systems IDS based on the role of T cells described by the negative selection algorithm, with those inspired by the role of dendritic cells to process the alarm signals and to judge thereafter whether there is presence of a dangerous element or not.","","978-1-4799-6608-0","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990233","Ad hoc networks;Artificial Immune Systems;Danger theory;Intrusion detection;Negative selection;Security","Detectors;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Sociology;Statistics","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET security;NSA;artificial immune systems;danger theory concepts;dendritic cells;intrusion detection system;negative selection algorithm","","0","","12","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work is complementary and consists in reorganising a given set of existing countermeasures in order to optimise both the security and the availability of the circuit without reducing its global performances. The proposed solution is based on a double-processor architecture and on mechanisms to parametrise the hardware and software countermeasures. One processor embeds the state-of-the-art set of countermeasures and executes the application code. The second processor, much smaller, applies the strategy of security (i.e the response of the circuit when a security event arises), but without sharing sensitive data with the first processor. We show that our approach enables the secure circuit's designer to easily fine tune the strategy of security, for example, of Pay-TV applications and could, in the future, be used to optimise dynamically the trade-off between performance and security.","2157-4952","978-1-4244-8705-9","978-1-4244-8703-5","10.1109/NTMS.2011.5721145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5721145","","Cryptography;Hardware;Monitoring;Sensors;Smart cards;Software","embedded systems;security of data;software architecture","complex strategy;countermeasure centered approach;double processor architecture;intrusion detection system;secret information recovery;secure embedded system","","0","","9","","","7-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is largely due to the integration of complex large data transfers across multiple zones of systems and network integration. The increase in transmission of highly sensitive data and challenges of data protection and of privacy, data loss prevention has major significant implications for systems engineering, systems integration, and systems analysis, design and validation. Furthermore, the design and development of complex integrated systems engineering and network systems lack effective transparency, auditability, validation and implementation of adequate security measures for transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks using third party and outsourced networks and the Internet and global privacy regulatory requirements for such data transfer across international borders. The major problem with current state of art approaches of controls for global critical infrastructures of virtual private networks (VPN) depend on inadequate third-party systems. Thus current approaches lack transparency, auditability and validation of the implementation of adequate privacy and security controls for data transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks. The additional problem of obscurity has resulted in increasing concealing of unauthorized access, identity thefts, privacy and security breaches of highly sensitive data, interception through the man-in-the-middle and intermediary systems.

However, such a centralized approach is not flexible nor is it robust. For example, it is very hard to find an appropriate system to which the user can upload information during a disaster, and the centralized server may be down because of overload or has been physically destroyed. We must consider a distributed and dynamic architecture for the system. Security and privacy issues are another concern that should be addressed for providing information from user's mobile terminals.

Tested systems included the BlueView ProViewer P450E-15, BlueView ProViewer P900E-20, and RESON SeaBat 7128, which were chosen for the good balance of resolution and range provided by their frequency of operation (450 kHz, 900 kHz, and 400 kHz, respectively) revealed during a prior study. Video clips were recorded from these systems while observing swimmers, open-circuit scuba divers, and closed-circuit rebreather divers in a marine harbor in St. Petersburg, FL. Clips were randomized and presented to 18 volunteer evaluators who were asked to identify which clips contained divers and which did not. The highest scoring system also had the highest operating frequency. However, the same high-scoring sonar in a different configuration scored similar to the system with the lowest frequency. This indicates that signal frequency, and therefore image resolution, is not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. After noticing many evaluators performed poorly with cluttered clips or clips with low acoustic target strength, results were recalculated to remove swimmers and surface swim routes such that only uncluttered, clearly-reflecting targets were included. Some sonar scores were moderately improved by this change, while others significantly decreased. This indicated that target clarity is also not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. Further analysis is recommended to reveal all major factors affecting assessment to maximize quality and eventually bring underwater security assessment to a high level.","","978-1-4244-4332-1","","10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664320","","Acoustic beams;Acoustics;Book reviews;Humans;Imaging;Security;Sonar","sonar imaging;underwater acoustic communication","high security underwater assessment;human recognizable images;imaging sonars;preliminary evaluation;surface swim routes","","0","","1","","","20-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we have implemented S-ACK scheme to transmit the secure acknowledgement. To detect attackers, a trust model is designed. The Forward ant agents transmit back the digitally signed S-ACK through the Backward Ant agent to detect any selective forwarding attack against any source node.

Specifically, we model the activity of an intruder with a Markov chain of finite state space, corresponding to logical or physical states in a network, and suppose there is a state b which we would not like the intruder to enter. The intruder, on the other hand, would like to enter this sensitive part of the network and wants to spend as much time there as possible. The state of the intruder evolves in discrete time; also there are a limited number of opportunities for the security system to make state observations over the finite horizon of the problem. This model can be used to capture the essence of intrusion detection in a variety of situations such as hackers in a network or physical intruders in a spatial area where there is a constraint on the number of observations one may make due to power limitations. We develop an optimal policy for dynamically scheduling observations to minimize the amount of time that the intruder spends in b without being discovered.","","978-1-4673-0008-7","978-1-4673-0723-9","10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6167419","IT security;decision making;dynamic programming;intrusion detection;monitoring;network security;resource allocation;surveillance","Communities;Dynamic programming;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Vectors","Markov processes;computer network security","IT networks;Markov chain;alarm intrusion detection;computer network;finite state space;network logical states;network physical states;optimal policy","","0","","14","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The recently discovered security attacks like W32.Stuxnet and the Duqu worm changed this almost established belief. Further, usual methods of anomaly detection cannot simply be employed in embedded systems since they are usually resource-constrained and the detection methods might interfere with performance of the main system tasks. However, behavior of applications running in embedded systems is relatively known, and profiling the correct behavior and comparing it with the runtime behavior is accounted as an effective approach for anomaly detection with no such interferences. In this paper, we consider the inter-effects of processor temperature and power consumption of embedded systems, and present a novel technique to detect malicious activities with minor delays with respect to the occurrences. This is done through analyzing the simultaneously observed power and temperature of the processor. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by using the power and temperature traces of a real processor obtained through detailed simulations.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994033","X2-distance;anomaly detection;clustering;power trace;profiling;temperature trace","Embedded systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","computer crime;embedded systems;invasive software;power consumption;safety-critical software","Duqu worm;W32.Stuxnet;anomaly detection;embedded systems;malicious activities detection;power consumption;power monitoring;processor power;processor temperature inter-effects;runtime behavior;security attacks;security violations;temperature monitoring","","0","","20","","","3-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here we have a comprehensive solution for network administrators who intend to maintain their networks private from others and want to conserve any confidential data. Our solution is based on a very simple practice that “Network administrators should try hacking their networks themselves before bad guys do”. Many big organizations implements this practice by recruiting ethical hackers to analyze their networks but other organizations including government organizations of developing and under developed countries are still unable to preserve their network privacy.

The primary users dictate the system states and their transitions while the secondary users and jammers behave non-cooperatively to achieve their goals independently under different system environment. Our Markovian game model captures not only the zero-sum interactions between secondary users and the jammers but also the dynamics of the system. Our results indicate that the secondary users can enhance their security level or increase their long-term payoff by either improving their sensing capabilities to confuse the jammer with the choice or choosing to communicate under states where the available channels are less prone to jamming. In the numerical experiments, we point out that the payoff of the secondary users increases with the number of available jamming-free channels and is eventually limited by the behavior of primary users.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502451","","Cognitive radio;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Communication system security;Emulation;Frequency;Jamming;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","Markov processes;cognitive radio;jamming;stochastic games;wireless channels","Markovian game model;antijamming scenario;jamming-free channels;multichannel cognitive radio systems;stochastic zero-sum game model;zero-sum interactions","","12","","20","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Web service is defined as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network based on a set of XML standards. This new architecture and set of protocols brings new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect Web services. In this paper, we propose using honeypots to detect and study attacks against Web services. Honeypots are used to learn new techniques, tools and motivations of hackers to better protect the production systems against attacks. Our solution (WS Honeypot) is to deploy a honeypot as a web service application.

In order to overcome these shortcomings of current intrusion detection techniques, a new distributed intrusion detection model based on mobile agent is proposed in this paper. Intelligent and mobile characteristics of the agent are used to make computing move to data. As mobile agent can only improve the structure of system and can not supply fundamental new detecting techniques, improved dynamic clonal selection algorithm and collaborative signal mechanism are adopted for reducing false positive rate and increasing detection rate in this paper. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm were simulated by KDDpsila99 datasets.

Four models are proposed to clarify the security problems: software vulnerability model, scalability model, authentication model, and covert model. We also propose several defense principles for all models. The security reduction is also proposed to transform the solution method for security problems to other available security verification and testing approaches. For example, the implementation security of network protocols is reduced to the security of software implementation for parsing protocols, so that the fuzzy test can be used for verification.

"Network anomaly detection tools based on association rules","Othman, Z.A.; Eljadi, E.E.","Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.","2155-6822","978-1-4577-0753-7","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705","Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS)","Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces","computer network security;data mining","CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule","","1","","25","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Introducing objects into the control processes of complex systems makes IoT security very difficult to address. Indeed, the Internet of Things is a complex paradigm in which people interact with the technological ecosystem based on smart objects through complex processes. The interactions of these four IoT components, person, intelligent object, technological ecosystem, and process, highlight a systemic and cognitive dimension within security of the IoT. The interaction of people with the technological ecosystem requires the protection of their privacy. Similarly, their interaction with control processes requires the guarantee of their safety. Processes must ensure their reliability and realize the objectives for which they are designed. We believe that the move towards a greater autonomy for objects will bring the security of technologies and processes and the privacy of individuals into sharper focus. Furthermore, in parallel with the increasing autonomy of objects to perceive and act on the environment, IoT security should move towards a greater autonomy in perceiving threats and reacting to attacks, based on a cognitive and systemic approach. In this work, we will analyze the role of each of the mentioned actors in IoT security and their relationships, in order to highlight the research challenges and present our approach to these issues based on a holistic vision of IoT security.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785328","","Context;Data privacy;Ecosystems;Privacy;Reliability;Safety;Security","Internet of Things;data privacy;security of data","IoT security;cognitive dimension;control processes;internet of things;object autonomy;privacy protection;safety guarantee;smart objects;systemic dimension;technological ecosystem","","0","","14","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","12","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the ever-increasing number of attacks and network complexity, traditional software approaches on uni-processors have become inadequate for the current high-speed network. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel algorithm to speedup string matching performed on GPUs. We also innovate new state machine for string matching, the state machine of which is more suitable to be performed on GPU. We have also described several speedup techniques considering special architecture properties of GPU. The experimental results demonstrate the new algorithm on GPUs achieves up to 4,000 times speedup compared to the AC algorithm on CPU. Compared to other GPU approaches, the new algorithm achieves 3 times faster with significant improvement on memory efficiency. Furthermore, because the new Algorithm reduces the complexity of the Aho-Corasick algorithm, the new algorithm also improves on memory requirements.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683320","","Algorithm design and analysis;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Throughput","computer graphic equipment;computer network security;coprocessors;multi-threading;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;GPU;computer systems protection;multi-threaded Algorithm;network attacks;network intrusion detection system;state machine;string matching","","13","","20","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm is a multiple patterns matching algorithm commonly used for such applications. In order to meet the highly demanding performance requirements imposed on these applications, achieving high performance for AC algorithm is crucial. In this paper, we present a high performance parallel implementation of AC algorithm on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) which efficiently utilizes the high degree of on-chip parallelism and the memory hierarchy of the GPU so that the aggregate performance (or throughput) of the GPU can be maximized. For this purpose our approach carefully places and caches the input text data and the reference pattern data used for pattern matching in the on-chip shared memories and the texture caches of the GPU. Furthermore, it efficiently schedules the off-chip global memory loads and the shared memory stores in order to minimize the overheads in loading the input data to the shared memories and also to minimize the shared memory bank conflicts. The proposed approach leads to a significant cut-down of the effective memory access latencies and leads to impressive performance improvements. Experimental results on Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 GPU show that our approach delivers up to 127Gbps throughput performance and up to 222-times speedup compared with a serial version running on 2.2Ghz Core2Duo Intel processor.","","978-0-7695-4979-8","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651081","Aho-Corasick algorithm;GPU;parallelization;shared-memory bank conflict","AC machines;Algorithm design and analysis;Doped fiber amplifiers;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Memory management;Pattern matching","graphics processing units;parallel processing;pattern matching","AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick algorithm;Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 GPU;graphic processing unit;high throughput parallel implementation;memory access latencies;memory hierarchy;off-chip global memory loads;on-chip parallelism;patterns matching algorithm","","1","","19","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they are still one of the most vulnerable parts of organizations infrastructure. Exploits are many times used by worms to fast propagate across the full Internet being Web servers one of their main targets. New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.","1060-9857","978-0-7695-3826-6","","10.1109/SRDS.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421","exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware","Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server","Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security","HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit","","1","1","36","","","27-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a class of neighborhood-relation signatures (NRS) are proposed, including 1-NRS, 2-NRS and (1,2)-NRS. NRS can be used for detecting polymorphic worms since these worms often remain the same relationship between bytes in changing their patterns. Two signature generation algorithm based on expectation-maximization (EM) and Gibbs Sampling are designed to generate NRS. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of NRS and the correctness of the process of signatures generation. Experiment results show that our approach of defending polymorphic worm based on NRS is more effective than other approach based on existed signatures.","","978-1-4244-4600-1","978-0-7695-3738-2","10.1109/HPCC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5167013","","Atherosclerosis;Change detection algorithms;Cryptography;Frequency;High performance computing;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Sampling methods","digital signatures;expectation-maximisation algorithm;invasive software;sampling methods","Gibbs sampling algorithm;NRS;expectation-maximization algorithm;neighborhood-relation signature;polymorphic worm detection;signature generation algorithm","","0","","13","","","25-27 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use the Bro intrusion detection system to monitor the SMTP sessions in a university campus, and track the number and the uniqueness of the recipients' email addresses in the outgoing mail messages from each individual internal host as the features for detecting spamming bots. Due to the huge number of email addresses observed in the SMTP sessions, we store and manage them efficiently in the Bloom filters. According to the SMTP logs over a period of six months from November 2011 to April 2012, we found totally 65 dedicated spamming bots in the campus and observed 1.5 million outgoing spam messages from them.We also found account cracking events on 14 legitimate mail servers, on which some user accounts are cracked and abused for spamming. The method can effectively detect and curb the spamming bots with the precision and the recall up to 0.97 and 0.96.","1738-9445","978-1-4673-3148-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488163","Bloom filters;botnet;detection;network monitoring;spamming activities","Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Industries;Internet;Monitoring;Postal services","Internet;computer network security;data structures;e-mail filters;educational institutions;unsolicited e-mail","Bloom filters;Bro intrusion detection system;Internet bandwidth;SMTP logs;SMTP session monitoring;account cracking events;bot spamming activity detection;internal host;legitimate mail servers;mail server storage space;network monitoring;outgoing mail messages;precision value;recall value;recipient e-mail addresses;spam delivery;spam message filtering;spamming bot detection;university campus","","1","","16","","","27-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When used with attack graph-based security metrics, the attack graph may be used to quantitatively assess security-relevant aspects of a network. The Shortest Path metric, the Number of Paths metric, and the Mean of Path Lengths metric are three attack graph-based security metrics that can extract security-relevant information. However, one's usage of these metrics can lead to misleading results. The Shortest Path metric and the Mean of Path Lengths metric fail to adequately account for the number of ways an attacker may violate a security policy. The Number of Paths metric fails to adequately account for the attack effort associated with the attack paths. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a complimentary suite of attack graph-based security metrics and specify an algorithm for combining the usage of these metrics. We present simulated results that suggest that our approach reaches a conclusion about which of two attack graphs correspond to a network that is most secure in many instances.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611550","Network-level security and protection;measurement;measurement techniques.","Complexity theory;Electronic mail;Measurement;Network security;Security","graph theory;information retrieval;security of data","extending attack graph based security aggregation;extending attack graph based security metrics;path lengths metric;security policy;security relevant information extraction;shortest path metric","","7","","21","","2010-10-28","Jan.-Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using this model, we show that it is possible to perform very efficient sampling with limited impact on traffic feature distributions, thus minimizing the decrease of anomaly detection efficiency. Specifically, we propose an adaptive, feature-aware statistical sampling technique and compare it both formally and empirically with other known sampling techniques - random flow sampling and selective sampling.

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2198666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198335","Industrial networks;information security;network security;risk assessment;security analysis and monitoring;security countermeasures","Availability;Guidelines;NIST;Process control;Risk management;Security;Servers","computer network security;production engineering computing;risk management","Information and Communication Technology;cyber threat;detect-and-patch philosophy;distributed ICT infrastructure;general-purpose computer network protection;industrial computer network;industrial distributed computing system;security countermeasure;security issues;security risk","","17","","105","","2012-05-10","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
