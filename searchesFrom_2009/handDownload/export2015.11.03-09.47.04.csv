Memory architectures match input streams against thousands of attack patterns by traversing the corresponding state transition table stored in commodity memories. With the increasing number of attack patterns, reducing memory requirement has become critical for memory architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel memory architecture using perfect hashing to condense state transition tables without hash collisions. The proposed memory architecture achieves up to 99.5% improvement in memory reduction compared to the traditional two-dimensional memory architecture.

In this paper, we discuss the application of this concept for IMS networks as well as the resulting implementation of a flooding detector, and describe some practical experiences based utilizing different traffic generation tools.

To overcome this problem, we propose a system whereby the system can detect whether the current user is the authorized user, a substitute user or an intruder pretending to be a valid user. Therefore the system checks the identity of the user by their behaviour pattern using keystrokes dynamics to authenticate user. A number of samples of login and password attempts of each user is gathered and stored in a database. From the samples collected, keystroke patterns are derived called feature sets and signatures are formed for each user using Fuzzy Logic algorithms. Once signatures are formed, users are authenticated by comparing their typing pattern to the respective signatures formed. We study the performance of such a system based on features like False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR), thus evaluating the efficiency of the system.","","","","10.1109/ICTSD.2015.7095873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095873","Keystroke dynamics;biometrics;computer security;continuous authentication system;continuous biometric authentication;feature selection;intrusion detection;user typing behaviour;user-independent threshold","Computers;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Standards;Sustainable development;Timing","authorisation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;message authentication","FAR;FRR;false acceptance rate;false rejection rate;feature sets;fuzzy logic membership function;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;typing pattern;user authentication","","0","","6","","","4-6 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore security in Wireless Sensor Network WSNs is challenging and critical to the functionality of the networked sensors. This is very important in cases of highly secure environment, especially in industrial, military, and medical domains. The standard WSN protocols focus on energy efficiency; transmission efficiency, and routing. WSN is known for limitations on hardware and software and for resources-constrained in general. An adaptive model of security that meets requirements and constraints in WSN is Intrusion Detections.

Cyber attacks could block the connection between SCADA Control Centre and its remote devices or insert fake commands and/or measurements in the equipment communications. With reference to an actual case study, constituted by a SCADA system controlling a portion of a medium voltage electrical grid and a corporate network, we investigate the use of modeling versus a hybrid test bed to conduct actual cyber attacks on SCADA and to analyze their consequences on SCADA and on the electrical grid. Modeling is in charge of predicting consequences of cyber attacks on SCADA and the electrical grid, while the test bed is in charge to reproduce cyber attacks and their propagation more realistically then modeling. The hybrid test bed is constituted by the coexistence of actual and simulated systems and devices of SCADA, corporate network and the electrical grid. The final hybrid test bed will include the most adequate models essentially to reproduce missing components such as the electrical grid and parts of corporate network and SCADA system.","","978-1-4799-3530-7","","10.1109/CCST.2014.6986997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986997","critical infrastructure protection;cyber attacks;electrical grid;interdependency analysis;scada","Circuit breakers;IP networks;Monitoring;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers;Substations","SCADA systems;computer network security;critical infrastructures;power engineering computing;power grids","ICT pervasiveness;SCADA control centre;catastrophic failures;corporate network;critical infrastructures;cyber attackers;cyber attacks;cyber security;equipment communications;information and communication technologies;medium voltage electrical grid;nervous system;remote devices;supervision control and data acquisition","","0","","13","","","13-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To test the tools in a realistic scenario, Vulnerability and Attack Injection is applied in a setup based on three web applications of different sizes and complexities.

However, signature matching has become a key limiting factor to restrict the performance of a signature-based NIDS in large-scale distributed network environment. The overhead network packets can greatly reduce the effectiveness of such detection systems and heavily consume computer resources. To mitigate this issue, a more efficient signature matching algorithm is desirable. In this paper, we therefore develop an adaptive character frequency-based exclusive signature matching scheme that can be implemented in a signature-based NIDS to help improve the performance of signature matching. In the experiment, we implemented our scheme in a distributed network environment and evaluated the performance of our scheme compared with Snort.

In this paper, we concentrate on detection Trojan horse by operation system information in Windows environment using data mining technology. Our main content and contribution contains as follows: First, we collect Trojan horse samples in true network environment and classify them by scanner. Secondly, we collect operation system behavior features under infected and clean circumstances separately by WMI manager tools. And then, several classic classification algorithms are applied and a performance comparison is given. Feature selection methods are applied to those features and we get a feature order list which reflects the relevance order of Trojan horse activities and the system feature.

This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets.

We propose in this work a new signal fingerprinting approach based on discrete wavelet transformer. Instead of being extracted from the transient part, the signal fingerprint is computed on a part of the signal related to the transmission of a definite sequence of bits. This sequence is expected to be transmitted by every base station antenna in the network.

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often employed to monitor network traffic and host activities that may lead to unauthorized accesses and attacks against vulnerable services. Most of the conventional misuse-based and anomaly-based IDSs are ineffective against attacks targeted at encrypted protocols since they heavily rely on inspecting the payload contents. To combat against attacks on encrypted protocols, we propose an anomaly-based detection system by using strategically distributed monitoring stubs (MSs). We have categorized various attacks against cryptographic protocols. The MSs, by sniffing the encrypted traffic, extract features for detecting these attacks and construct normal usage behavior profiles. Upon detecting suspicious activities due to the deviations from these normal profiles, the MSs notify the victim servers, which may then take necessary actions. In addition to detecting attacks, the MSs can also trace back the originating network of the attack. We call our unique approach DTRAB since it focuses on both Detection and TRAceBack in the MS level. The effectiveness of the proposed detection and traceback methods are verified through extensive simulations and Internet datasets.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2039492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392994","Computer security;encrypted protocol (cryptographic protocol);intrusion detection system (IDS)","","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","DTRAB approach;Internet;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based detection system;cryptographic protocols;detection-and-traceback approach;distributed monitoring stubs;encrypted protocols;intrusion detection systems;misuse-based IDS;network traffic;network-based applications;secure communication;traffic-feature analysis","","15","","42","","2010-01-19","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms can deliver satisfactory results in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and testing time.","","978-1-4244-2308-8","978-1-4244-2309-5","10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784780","","Bit error rate;Computer crime;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines","ESVDF;backward elimination ranking;classification accuracy;enhanced support vector decision function;features ranking;features selection;forward selection ranking;intrusion detection systems;support vector machines;testing time;training time","","6","","40","","","10-13 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Choosing a P2P architecture, however, has significant constraints on the requirements of a given software engineering process in terms of security, reliability and performance. In addition, requirements for P2P architectures have to be expressed in notions of network engineering, because these architectures rank from the application layer to the IP networklayer. Thus, engineering P2P systems is a cross-disciplinary task between software and network engineers. We explain the ramifications P2P applications have on requirements of a given software engineering problem. A structured method supports software engineers in understanding the constraints of different kinds of P2P architectures and protocols on requirements. In addition, we present patterns of how the requirements have to be expressed, so that they contain all required information for network engineers that implementthe P2P architectures.","","978-1-4673-2244-7","","10.1109/ARES.2012.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6329221","P2P;network engineering;performance;reliability;requirements engineering;security;software architecture","Computer architecture;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Reliability;Security","peer-to-peer computing;security of data;software architecture;software performance evaluation;software reliability","P2P architectures;network engineering;peer-to-peer driven software engineering;protocols;software design;software engineering process;software performance;software reliability;software security","","0","","20","","","20-24 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The VLSI architecture is implemented on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) as it provides the flexibility of reconfigurability and reprogram ability. Intrusion sequences can be detected by using a flexible pattern matching model called similarity match which enables the system to not only reduce false positive alarms, but also detect clever intruders with unexpected behavior.

These two concerns, however, are often handled separately. In this paper we present a threat driven approach that improves on the quality of software through the realization of a more secure functional model. The approach introduces systematic transformation rules and integration steps for mapping attack tree representations into lower level dynamic behavior, then integrates this behavior into state chart-based functional models. Through the focus on both the functional and threat behavior, software engineers can introduce, clearly define and understand security concerns as software is designed. To identify vulnerabilities, our approach then applies security analysis and threat identification to the integrated model.","","978-1-4577-0780-3","978-0-7695-4453-3","10.1109/SSIRI.2011.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5991998","Software security;attack trees;software design;statecharts;system modeling;threat modeling","Analytical models;HTML;Logic gates;Security;Semantics;Software;Unified modeling language","Internet;formal specification;safety-critical software;security of data;software quality","Internet;mapping attack tree representations;software functionality;software quality;software security;statechart-based functional models;system specifications;systematic transformation rules;threat driven approach;threat identification;untrustworthy computing;vulnerabilities","","2","","27","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events. IDSs with active probing are now being proposed for such attacks which involve sending of probe packets that cause difference in sequence of events under attack condition and can be then detected using passive monitoring.

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well.

Currently, packet analysis is provided by almost each ISP but it has a high impact in term of performance and energy consumption; this makes the choice of the optimal IDS strategy both a key and non-trivial issue. To this aim, IDS strategies have been deeply investigated in term of performance, while the assessment of the energy consumption is quite unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first attempt towards the assessment of the energy impact of security solutions.

Among them, a threat caused by black hole attack is more prominent. A trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes while a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing to inner attacks. The previous work proposed two simple models along with trust computation methods to filter out black hole nodes using the benevolent ones and achieved better performance against pure black hole attacks. In this study, a method to prevent gray hole attack, one kind of black hole attack, which is more cunning and clandestine attack is proposed. The neighbour observing model based on watchdog concept is focused on the direct trust value (DTV) to detect single black hole attack. Historical evidence is also taken into consideration against gray hole attacks. Moreover, the neighbour recommendation model that companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to detect the cooperative black hole attacks. On the other hand, the proposed method tries to balance the trust values from different neighbour nodes to mitigate the damage by their deceiving. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attack.","1738-9445","978-1-4673-0150-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174693","Black hole attack;Direct trust value;Grey hole attack;Historical evidence;Indirect trust value;MANET;Trust management strategy","Bismuth;Cryptography;Digital TV;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nickel;Relays","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;trusted computing","MANET;cooperative black hole attack;gray hole attack;historical evidence based trust management strategy;indirect trust value;inner attack;neighbour observing model;neighbour recommendation model;watchdog concept","","4","","13","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RECLAMO is proposing a novel approach: diverting the attack to a specific honey net that has been dynamically built based on the attack information. Among all components forming the RECLAMO's architecture, this paper is mainly focused on defining a trust and reputation management model, essential to recognize if IDSs are exposing an honest behavior in order to accept their alerts as true.

In this paper, we propose a novel system placed at the network egress point that aims to efficiently and effectively detect APT malware infections based on malicious DNS and traffic analysis. The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together. Our experiment was performed at a large local institute network for two months, and all the features were studied with big data, which includes ~400 million DNS queries.

Therefore, we consider the effect of reputation when parties interact in social cloud to find a new way realizing mutual cooperation. More specifically, parities in the social cloud are rational who value their reputation. Cooperation can boost their reputation, so they have incentives to cooperate with others such that they may get a higher utility. The basic idea of this paper is to add reputation deriving from social cloudas part of the utility. That is, we describe the architecture and interaction between two rational parties in the social cloud, where two parties receive their opponent's trust or reputation from the social cloud. The computation of trust and reputation is finished in the social cloud. Finally, we prove that given proper parameters in rational secure two-party computation (rational STPC), it is possible to complete the computation in just one round in the second stage of the protocol.","","978-1-4799-1774-7","","10.1109/WAINA.2015.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096180","Game theory;Nash equilibrium;Rational computation;Reputation;Social cloud","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Game theory;Lead;Protocols;Security;Social network services","cloud computing;game theory;social networking (online);trusted computing","STPC;game theory;rational parties;secure two-party computation;social cloud;trust computation","","0","","","","","24-27 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By employing the theorem that the sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables follows Erlang distribution, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the smallest allocated transmit power is mathematically obtained from the properties of downlink indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channels. Numerical results show that the total downlink capacity is greatly enhanced by the proposed power allocation scheme.

With the advent of big data era, it is expected the data analytic techniques to be much faster and more efficient than ever before. Moreover, one of the challenges with many modern algorithms is that they run too slowly in software to have any practical value. This paper proposes a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) -based intrusion detection system (IDS), driven by a new coupled metric learning to discover the inter- and intra-coupling relationships against the growth of data volumes and item relationship to provide a new approach for efficient anomaly detections. This work is experimented on our previously published NetFlow-based IDS dataset, which is further processed into the categorical data for coupled metric learning purpose.

The experimental results show the very promising performance by considering the coupled metric learning scheme in the FPGA implementation.

LCX radiates microwaves from slots milled on the outer conductor. This sensor can detect an intrusion object by measuring the variation of received signal. LCX has two types of emitting modes, radiation mode and surface mode. The microwave radiates to far field in radiation mode. On the other hand, the microwave exists only around the LCX in surface mode. Although the conventional LCX-based sensor operates the LCX in only one mode to detect and classify an object, this paper introduces a simultaneous sensing technique using these two modes. Comparing the signals in both modes, the classification of an object can be estimated. The theory of the emitting modes of LCX and the developed sensor prototype are described.

Dynamic forensics using IDS or honeypot are all based on a common hypothesis that the system is still in a reliable working situation and collected evidences are believable even if the system is suffered from intrusion. In fact, the system has already transferred into an insecurity and unreliable state, it is uncertain that whether the intrusion detectors and investigators could run as normal and whether the obtained evidences are credible. Although intrusion tolerance has been applied in many areas of security for years, few researches are referred to network forensics. The work presented in this paper is based on an idea to integrate intrusion tolerance into dynamic forensics to make the system under control, ensure the reliability of evidences and aim to gather more useful evidences for investigation. A mechanism of dynamic forensics based on intrusion forensics is proposed. This paper introduces the architecture of the model which uses IDS as tolerance and forensics trigger and honeypot as shadow server, the finite state machine model is described to specify the mechanism, and then two cases are analyzed to illuminate the mechanism.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207895","dynamic forensics;finite state machine;intrusion tolerance","Automata;Control systems;Distributed processing;Forensics;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Protection;Real time systems","finite state machines;security of data","dynamic forensics;evidence reliability;finite state machine model;honeypot;integrate intrusion tolerance;intrusion detection system;network forensics;security","","0","","15","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we define distributed firewall architecture that is designed specifically for MANET networks. Our design is using the concept of network capabilities and is especially suited for environment which lacks centralized structure and is composed of different devices. Our model denies all communication by default and nodes can access only services and other nodes that they are authorized to. Every node contains a firewall mechanism which includes intrusion prevention system and compromised node will not necessarily compromise whole secured network. Our approach should add security features for MANETs and help them withstand security threats which would otherwise damage, if not shutdown unsecured MANET network. Our simulation shows, that our solution has minimal overhead in terms of bandwidth and latency, works well even in the presence of routing changes due to mobile nodes and is effective in containing misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/SAMI.2015.7061882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061882","Ad hoc;firewall;mobile network;network capability","Databases;Firewalls (computing);Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Public key","computer network reliability;firewalls;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","base station-based wireless network routing;civil rapid-deployment network security;distributed firewall architecture;emergency rescue operations;intrusion prevention system security threats;mobile ad hoc disaster-relief network;mobile node fault;tactical military MANET;well-defined defense perimeter","","0","","9","","","22-24 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, by gratuitous ARP request packets, we propose a solution to the problem of ARP poisoning. Our suggested mechanism which is named a Gratuitous Decision Packet System (GDPS) seeks to achieve two main goals: (1) Detection of suspicious ARP packets, by implementing a real-time analyzing for received ARP packets.

Increases in electricity demand with inadequate delivery infrastructure and cyber-physical attack threats due to technological interdependencies introduce more complex events. Accurate and timely power system event identification and detection have great significance in system operation, monitoring, and control processes. Insufficient and slow event information may lead to catastrophes. Significant research effort is being made toward developing robust monitoring systems using advanced state of the art technologies such as synchrophasor technologies. This paper extends our previous work [1] and proposes a model that leverages the causal relationship between devices in cyber physical systems. Causal event graphs (CEG), a modified version of Bayesian networks, are used to create unique paths that model deterministic signatures of each cyber-physical event. The CEG and Bayesian network can be incorporated to event detection systems (EDS) to classify cyber physical events. A causal event graph for each scenario can be created using a sequence of power system events, measureable states, and logs from different sources. A modified IEEE 9 bus system with multi zone distance protection schemes for two transmission lines is used to demonstrate the proposed concept. A total of 22 cyber-physical scenarios are mapped into CEG and Bayesian networks to define rules for cyber-power system events.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939285","Bayesian network;CEG;EDS;cyber-physical;scenarios;synchrophasor","Bayes methods;Circuit faults;Monitoring;Phasor measurement units;Power system stability;Relays","belief networks;graph theory;phasor measurement;power transmission lines;power transmission protection","Bayesian networks;IEEE 9 bus system;causal event graph;cyber-physical attack threats;cyber-power system events;event detection systems;multizone distance protection;power system event identification;robust monitoring systems;synchrophasor technology;transmission lines","","0","","18","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With any Cyber-Physical system use Cloud Web Services it inherits a security problem, the HX-DoS attack. HX-DoS attack is a combination of HTTP and XML messages that are intentionally sent to flood and destroy the communication channel of the cloud service provider. The relevance of this research is that TCP/IP flood attacks are a common problem and a lot of research to mitigate them has previously been discussed. But HTTP denial of service and XML denial of service problem has only been addressed in a few papers. In this paper, we get closer to closing this gap on this problem with our new defence system called Pre-Decision, Advance Decision, Learning System (ENDER). In our previous experiments using our Cloud Protector, we were successful at detecting and mitigate 91% with a 9% false positive of HX-DoS attack traffic.

Separating the network communication components from the data processing ones is our concern in this paper. Many proposed schemes were presented recently, but none of which, employing separate system bus, have been proven experimentally as a potentially effective method for protecting the data stored in hard drives and removable disks. In our scheme, the system does not need to maintain any authentication mechanism or data integrity for the packets sent by any node, with a well-received attention towards threatening our valuable stored data. In this paper we implemented a model for a dual bus architecture system based on a bus bridge which controls the data transferred between the two system buses, as well as preventing all spy ware programs.

Such a network will be comprised of mobile sensor nodes that perceive various aspects of their environment and topologically reconfigure in order to secure a strategic area of interest. Risk awareness is provided through the application of a recently developed Risk Management Framework to the RSN. The risk level of each node is assessed in terms of their degree of distress, proximity factor, and terrain maneuverability. Risk monitoring alerts are issued whenever any given sensor node's quantitative risk metric exceeds a user-defined threshold value. At this point, a node-in-distress (NID) has been identified as the weak point of the securing structure around which the RSN is deployed. The NID can no longer be used with confidence and the effective perimeter coverage of the RSN has been reduced, thus creating potential security breaches in the area of interest. In response, the remaining nodes will self-organize to maximize the perimeter coverage while minimizing the cost of doing so. A limited set of contingency network topologies is produced via evolutionary multi-objective optimization using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and then ranked according to a human-guided alternative selection algorithm. The security operator picks the most suitable topology, which is then effectuated upon the environment. Results indicate that NSGA-II is capable of producing feasible network topologies to satisfy maximum perimeter coverage, while reducing the energy required for topology reconfiguration. As far as we are concerned, this is the first time a RSN applied to a CIP scenario is self-organized in response to a risk analysis conducted on every sensor node on the basis of multiple risk features.","","978-1-4673-4701-3","","10.1109/CIVEMSA.2013.6617409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617409","critical infrastructure protection;risk management;robotic sensor networks;self-organization;territorial security","Batteries;Biological cells;Network topology;Robot sensing systems;Security;Topology","critical infrastructures;genetic algorithms;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;risk analysis;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","CIP;NID;NSGA-II;RSN;contingency network topology reconfiguration;cost minimisation;critical infrastructure protection;degree of distress;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;human guided alternative selection algorithm;mobile sensor node;node-in-distress;nondominated sorting genetic algorithm;perimeter coverage maximisation;potential security;proactive risk aware robotic sensor network;proximity factor;risk assessment;risk awareness;risk management framework;risk monitoring alert;security operator;sensor node quantitative risk metric;terrain maneuverability","","2","","12","","","15-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is an important task for network administrators of electric power industry to monitor, control and manage electric power information networks. Through installing safeguards, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and anti-virus systems, the reliability of Electric Power Information Networks has been improved to a certain extent. However, threats also exist due to the loss of comprehensive understanding about network vulnerability. System methods should be employed to the vulnerability research of electric power information networks. Modeling Electric Power Information Network vulnerability and finding network flaws become more and more critical. A network intruder will take a series of actions to achieve a certain goal, and each action will change the state of a network. Thereby attack trees can be used to model the vulnerability of a network. An attack tree can be viewed as a directed tree where vertices represent network states and edges represent actions that lead state transitions. Root vertex is a certain goal. Any path from a leaf vertex to the root vertex is a whole attack pattern violating the security property of a network. A node of an attack tree can be decomposed as a set of attack sub-goals, either all of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed, or any one of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed. So there are two decomposition operations in an attack tree: AND and OR. Formal logic can be applied to attack analysis. Thus we can model attacks for network vulnerability analysis. This modeling method has two major advantages. At first it can be used to analyze the flaws of a network - - and find unknown flaws. Secondly network administrators use it to handle flaws rationally under the limits of the finite resources. Electric power information networks are generally made up of production control networks, enterprise management networks and external networks. They are connected and form a complex network. It is necessary to comprehend and analyze its vulnerability. An information network of an electric power plant is illustrated, and attack modeling is used to analyze its vulnerability. Industry control computers can manipulate electric devices. It is vital to guarantee industry control computers. Hence the goal is set to obtain the administrator right of an industry control computer. An attack tree is constructed tolocate the flaws of the network. Some advices to network security administrators are given. It is an attempt to formulate the security administration of electric power information networks using attack trees. Faulty Tree Method (FTM) has been used to analysis the reliability of power systems. Attack tree can help integrate the reliability analysis of the hybrid system consisting of an electric power system and an electric power information network system.","","978-1-4244-5938-4","","10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5666152","Electric power information network;attack tree;network security;vulnerability","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Fires;Monitoring;Security;Servers","directed graphs;fault trees;formal logic;load dispatching;power system reliability;power system simulation;security of data;trees (mathematics)","FTM;attack modeling;customer relation system;directed tree;electric power dispatch system;electric power information networks;electric power system;enterprise management networks;faulty tree method;formal logic;industry control computer;management information system;network security administrators;network vulnerability analysis;power system analysis;power system reliability;production control networks;root vertex;safeguard","","0","","15","","","24-28 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, FSVM assigns smaller memberships to support vectors, which may decrease the effects of these support vectors upon the construction of classification hyperplane. At the same time, FSVM has some disadvantages in dealing with the non-equilibrium data classification. Therefore, a novel method to determine membership function is proposed, and a new FSVM based on non-equilibrium data is constructed. Experiments show that the new FSVM can effectively reduce the misclassification rates produced by the class with fewer samples in dealing with non-equilibrium data classification problem. Therefore, the proposed FSVM may make the misclassification rates upon two classes approximately equal.","2160-133X","978-1-4673-1484-8","","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6358965","Classification;Fuzzy support vector machine;Membership function;Non-equilibrium data","Abstracts;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;support vector machines","FSVM;class centers;classification hyperplane;fuzzy support vector machine;membership function;misclassification rate reduction;nonequilibrium data classification","","0","","16","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the optimization of deferrable load scheduling to minimize the power consumption cost. The constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) model is formulated and solved to obtain the optimal scheduling policy. In addition, we consider the case that the data communications system to support RTP (i.e., to broadcast power price information to the deferrable load) can be under attack, which makes the power price information unavailable or falsified. The loss due to such attack can be analyzed using the proposed CMDP model. The results show that the power consumption cost in a scenario with attack is higher than that in a scenario without attack. The analysis will be useful for improving the intrusion detection system (IDS) to defend the attack.","1525-3511","978-1-4673-5938-2","978-1-4673-5937-5","10.1109/WCNC.2013.6555333","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6555333","Deferrable load scheduling;constrained Markov decision process (CMDP);smart grid","Cost function;Delays;Load modeling;Optimal scheduling;Power demand;Smart grids","Markov processes;decision theory;demand side management;optimisation;power consumption;power system economics;power system security;pricing;scheduling;security of data","CMDP model;DR program;IDS;RTP;constrained Markov decision process;data communication system;deferrable load scheduling optimization;demand response program;intrusion detection system;optimal scheduling policy;power consumption;power consumption cost minimization;power price information attacks;public utility;real-time pricing;smart grid","","0","","11","","","7-10 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To evaluate the performance of this approach, we first introduce an analytical model. The results of this model reveal that the detection time of misbehaved nodes is reduced, and the impact of false positives and false negatives is minimised (that is, the overall accuracy is increased). These results are confirmed in the simulation results that follow.
