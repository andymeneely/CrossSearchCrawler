Reducing or eliminating the negative effects of any intrusion is a fundamental issue of network security. The network security problem can be represented as a game between the attacker or intruder and the network administrator where both the players try to attain maximum outcome. The network administrator tries to defend the attack and the attacker tries to overcome it and attack the system. Thus network security can be enforced using game theoretic approach.

Existing solutions such as portable microwave or passive infra-red (PIR) sensors are relatively inexpensive, but cannot work over uneven terrain, around corners, or in foliage. The cost and installation complexity of these sensors increases rapidly as more units are required. The Repels<sup>reg</sup> RF sensor provides many of the required features, but uses sensor cables that are overtly mounted above ground. The OmniTrax<sup>reg</sup> technology was first introduced at the 2004 Carnahan Conference, applying ultra wide band radar principles to a ranging leaky cable guided radar sensor. In 2007, a program called TFDIDS (terrain following deployable intrusion detection sensor) was initiated in conjunction with the US Air Force, to apply the advancements in this ranging technology to the rapid deployment sensor needs defined by the USAF tactical automated sensor system (TASS). This advancement includes a novel invention employing the processing of dual parallel leaky sensor cables, termed Stereo OmniTrax. This processing dramatically improves the discrimination between human intrusion threats and small nuisance targets or environmental effects. The TFDIDS system provides a complete lightweight sensor kit for the rapid deployment (less than 30 minutes) of a 100 m detection zone, and later, for the sensor's retrieval and reuse. TFDIDS interfaces to standard Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) including USAF powering and communications devices. This paper outlines the key elements of the TFDIDS design, describes its components, and explains how TFDIDS provides reliable detection using a surface sensor cable deployment. Initial performance results are presented, from tests conducted at the Senstar SITE in 2008. The test applications include through-the-woods, on tarmac and o- n typical open field surfaces.","","978-1-4244-4169-3","978-1-4244-4170-9","10.1109/CCST.2009.5335532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5335532","Rapid deployment perimeter security sensor;border security;leaky cable sensor;rapid deployment;sensor field testing;terrainfollowing deployable intrusion detection system;ultra wideband radar","Cables;Costs;Infrared sensors;Microwave sensors;Radio frequency;Security;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Testing;Ultra wideband radar","infrared detectors;military radar;ultra wideband radar","OmniTrax<sup>reg</sup> technology;RF sensor;Stereo OmniTrax;TFDIDS design;US Air Force;USAF tactical automated sensor system;deployable intrusion detection sensor;dual parallel leaky sensor cables;radar sensor;security sensor;standard Government furnished equipment;ultrawide band radar principles","","0","","4","","","5-8 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, widespread usage over UDP, limited use of encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level to launch denial of service attacks. To mitigate this, self- learning systems have been proposed to detect anomalous SIP messages and filter them. However, previous works use datasets with large differences between the normal and anomalous message. This gives high performance for existing classification systems, including those based on Euclidean distances. We present our analysis on a new dataset that has minimal difference between normal and anomalous messages. Our findings indicate that existing classification schemes behave unsatisfactorily on our dataset. We demonstrate why this is the case by statistical analysis of our dataset, and furthermore, present feature reduction techniques to enhance the classification performance of existing classification schemes on our dataset.","2157-4952","978-1-4244-8705-9","978-1-4244-8703-5","10.1109/NTMS.2011.5720662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720662","","Computer crime;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms","Internet;cryptographic protocols;message authentication;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;statistical analysis","Euclidean distance;Internet;anomalous message;anomaly detection;classification system;encryption;feature reduction technique;multimedia session establishment protocol;self learning system;session initiation protocol;statistical analysis","","8","","20","","","7-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The obfuscation was performed by tunneling the malicious traffic in HTTP and HTTPS protocols with the intention of simulating the usual legitimate characteristics of the HTTP traffic's flow. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities of four services were used: Samba, BadBlue, Apache, DCOM RPC. Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks. Data mining analysis was performed by using both bi-nominal and poly-nominal classifications, resulting into better performance of poly-nominal classification. At the summary, we emphasize the necessity of training the statistically and behaviorally based NBAs with divergent obfuscation techniques to strengthen their detection capabilities.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038827","IDS;NBA;buffer overflow;network vulnerabilities;protocol tunneling;traffic obfuscation","Buffer overflows;Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;data mining;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","AIPS;ASNM network features;Apache;BadBlue;DCOM RPC;HTTP protocols;HTTP secure protocol;HTTPS protocols;HTTPS traffic;IDS;NBA;SNORT detection;SNORT network features;Samba;advanced security network metrics;automated intrusion prevention system;binominal classification;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;classification accuracy;data mining analysis;hyper text transfer protocol;legitimate traffic simulations;obfuscated network buffer overflow attacks detection properties;obfuscated network vulnerability exploitation;polynominal classification;virtual network environment","","0","","30","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the conventional IPS deployment often has some limitations, and the deployment and maintenance costs are expensive, the utilization rate is low. In order to solve these issues, an SDN-based IPS deployment is presented in this paper, which supports a unified scheduling of security applications in the whole network and load balancing among IPSs. In addition, this paper builds a test-bed and shows evaluation results.

Currently, ISPs over-provision capacity in order to meet QoS demands from customers. Software-Defined Networking and OpenFlow allow for better network control and flexibility in the pursuit of operating networks as efficiently as possible. Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy. We show that not only local links serving variable bit-rate video streams, but also aggregated WAN links benefit from an adaptive polling rate to obtain accurate measurements.

Computers are integral part of everyday operations. Organizations depend on them. A computer failure will have a critical impact on the organization. The term “Security” brings to mind all shorts of issues that refer to data protection and prevention of unauthorised access. The common motives for computer crimes could be lure for money, revenge, terrorism, fun, recognition or curiosity. Information systems can be attacked by outsiders who may penetrate a computer system or by insiders who are authorised to use the resources but misuse their authorization. An attacker may disrupt the information system of an organization (active attack) or gain access to its sensitive information (passive attack). Although no direct damage is done in a passive attack, any leak in information could have drastic repercussions for the organization. In simple words, security can be defined as: protecting information system from intended access. The goal of network management is to provide users with a quality of service. To meet this goal, network services plan involve strategic and technical planning of engineering, operations and maintenance of the network. The field of network security and management is constantly undergoing changes in technology, applications and hence the need for continually changing skills set on the part of academics. We will try to cover the various points with respect to organizational structure, policies and techniques of network security and management. Impact of various factors including management has been discussed on network security.","","978-1-4244-5965-0","978-1-4244-5967-4","10.1109/ICCIC.2010.5705886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705886","","","authorisation;computer crime;computer network management;computer network security;information retrieval;information systems;strategic planning;telecommunication network planning","computer crimes;data protection;information access;information system security;network maintenance;network management;network security;network service plan;quality of service;strategic planning;technical planning;unauthorised access","","0","","","","","28-29 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the speed of data packet capture and analysis doesn't match the network application, which causes a general problem in IDS and the ratio of data packet lost is quite high. Various intrusion detection technologies are widely used to solve this problem. In those technologies, the pattern matching based on knowledge is the most popular technology. It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way. It plays an essential role in the efficiency of intrusion detection system. As network speed and capacity is growing rapid, it is necessary to improve the algorithm of pattern matching to follow the currency.

Our approach is based on the use of Markovian models (namely high order Markov chains) for modelling SIP signalling traffic. In particular our work focuses on detection of three kinds of attacks: VoIP fuzzing, flood based denial of service, and signalling manipulation.

This paper compares them in topological structures, initializing ways, learning methods, et al. Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved. Thirdly, clone expansion of antibodies is suppressed by idiotypic effects, thus false positive rate is decreased. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this adaptive detection approach. Compared with the detection approach based on a multilayer perception network, the false positive rate is decreased and the detection accuracy of unknown attacks is increased.","1866-7791","978-1-4244-3844-0","","10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228006","idiotypic networks;intrusion detection;neural networks;pattern recognition","Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Learning systems;Mechatronics;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Pattern recognition","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","Fisher Iris dataset;KDD-CUP-99 database;adaptive detection approach;adaptive intrusion detection approach;antigens;idiotypic networks;initializing ways;learning methods;multilayer perception network;neural networks;pattern recognition technology;topological structures","","5","","11","","","20-21 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current cluster algorithms use cluster center to calculate the distance which leads to fairly big calculation errors. In order to aggregate the massive alert data effectively and identify important security events accurately, we propose an improved Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm based on Similarity Radius (SR-ISODATA). In the presented algorithm, optimal sequence comparison method is used to calculate the attribute weight of alert data, and different similarity calculation methods are chosen due to different properties of alert data; the merging and splitting criteria are revised, the clustering center in the original ISODATA algorithm is replaced by the average similarity radius and the distance calculation in the original algorithm is replaced by the similarity.

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications. This work presents a multi level hierarchical routing protocol, which is based on the LEACH protocol. This protocol improves both the energy efficiency and the lifetime of the network. Two-level LEACH (TL-LEACH), Three-level LEACH (3L-LEACH) and Four-level LEACH (4L-LEACH) have been presented.

Accordingly, we pose the evaluation and the deployment problems; the former is to evaluate the new coverage measure of a given sensor network, and the latter is to find an optimal placement of k additional sensor nodes to improve the coverage for a given positive integer k. We present several algorithms solving the problems that are either centralized or localized with theoretical proofs and simulation results, showing that our algorithms are efficient and easy to implement in practice while the quality of outputs is guaranteed by formal proofs. Our algorithms are based on an interesting relation between our new coverage measure and a certain quantity of a point set, called the bottleneck, which has been relatively well studied in other disciplines.

SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence.

It is based on the idea that human beings tend to exhibit random motion patterns during abnormal situations. Hence, angular and linear displacements of limb movements are characterized using basic statistical quantities. In addition, it is enhanced with the entropy of the Fourier spectrum to measure the randomness of the abnormal behavior.

By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers.","1063-6927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2015.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164948","","Ash;Communities;IP networks;Malware;Robustness;Servers;Silicon","data mining;hypermedia;invasive software;network servers","HTTP requests;HTTP traffic;ISP;SMASH;cyber criminals;dynamic malicious infrastructures;malicious HTTP activities;malware campaign discovery;malware distribution;systematic mining of associated server herds;undetected malicious servers;zero-day attacks","","0","","31","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use an association rule to track all relevant data dependency rule sets for different access roles using a hierarchical structure. We identify malicious transactions from the transaction logs in the database using the data dependency rule sets. These rule sets are continuously updated and stored in a repository.

But the scheme does not detect the route in which the nodes alter the data. The detection of route in which such malicious node is present, will enable us to avoid that route for further transmission. This calls for a proper method to detect the malicious route.

Driven by the miniaturization and integration of sensing, communication, and computation in cost-efficient devices, CPSs are bound to transform industries such as aerospace, transportation, built environments, energy, health care, and manufacturing, to name a few. This great opportunity, unfortunately, is matched by even greater challenges. Taming the complexity of design and analysis of these systems poses a fundamental problem as a new paradigm is needed to bridge various scientific domains, which, through the years, have developed significantly different formalisms and methodologies. In addition, while the use of dedicated communication networks has so far sheltered systems from the outside world, use of off-the-shelf networking and computing, combined with the unattended operation of a plethora of devices, provides several opportunities for malicious entities to inject attacks on CPSs. A wide variety of motivations exists for launching an attack on CPSs, ranging from economic reasons, such as obtaining a financial gain, all the way to terrorism, for instance, threatening an entire population by manipulating life-critical resources. Any attack on safety-critical CPSs may significantly hamper the economy and lead to the loss of human lives. While the threat of attacks on CPSs tends to be underplayed at times, the Stuxnet worm provided a clear example of the possible future to come. This malware, targeting a uranium enriching facility in Iran, managed to reach the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system controlling the centrifuges used in the enrichment process. Stuxnet modified the control system, increasing pressure in the centrifuges in a first version of the worm and spinning centrifuges in an erratic fashion in a second version. As a result, Stuxne- caused significant damage to the plant [1].

Neural networks method is a promising technique which has been used in many classification problems. The neural network component will implement the neural approach, which is based on the assumption that each user is unique and leaves a unique footprint on a computer system when using it. If a user's footprint does not match his/her reference footprint based on normal system activities, the system administrator or security officer can be alerted to a possible security breach.

Until now, only a few researchers considered the use of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to combat these threats against CRNs. In this article we describe a CRN based on IEEE wireless regional area network (WRAN) and describe some of the security threats against it. For the secondary users in the CRN to quickly detect whether they are being attacked, a simple yet effective IDS is then presented. Our proposal uses non-parametric cumulative sum (cusum) as the change point detection algorithm to discover the abnormal behavior due to attacks. Our proposed IDS adopts an anomaly detection approach and it profiles the CRN system parameters through a learning phase. So, our proposal is also able to detect new types of attacks. As an example, we present the case of detection of a jamming attack, which was not known to the IDS beforehand. The proposed IDS is evaluated through computer based simulations, and the simulation results clearly indicate the effectiveness of our proposal.","0890-8044","","","10.1109/MNET.2013.6523809","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523809","","Cognitive radio;Intrustion detection;Network security;Privacy;Security;Telecommunication network management;Wireless networks","cognitive radio;jamming;radio networks;radio spectrum management;security of data;wide area networks","CRN;CRN system parameter;IDS;IEEE wireless regional area network;WRAN;anomaly detection approach;cognitive radio network;combating attack;cusum;intrusion detection system;jamming attack;nonparametric cumulative sum;radio spectrum scarcity;security threat","","4","","","","","May-June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we focus on detecting and excluding nodes that misbehave by dropping some or all packets forwarded through them. We propose a reputation-based scheme for efficiently solving the problem. The proposed scheme use both self-observation and second-hand information to establish comprehensive reputation of a node. Nodes with bad comprehensive reputation will be excluded from the network. History reputation is also taken into account to providing indeliberate faults tolerance. Furthermore, we use fuzzy analysis to deal with the imprecision based on the fact that the cause of packet dropping can be heterogeneous and therefore improve the performance without imposing a high computational burden.","","978-1-4244-4754-1","978-1-4244-4738-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358211","ad hoc networks;packet dropping;reputations","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Fault tolerance;High performance computing;History;Mathematics;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Routing","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;fuzzy set theory;mobile radio","fault tolerance;fuzzy analysis;history reputation;malicious packet dropping;mobile ad hoc network;network performance;node misbehavior;reputation-based scheme","","1","","18","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It consists of four components, namely, rule-based component, belief combination component, security sensitive history database component and Bayesian learning component. The rule-based component consists of a set of well-defined rules which give independent evidences about a transaction's behavior. An extension of Dempster-Shafer's theory is used to combine multiple such evidences and an initial belief is computed. First level inferences are made about the transaction depending on this initial belief. Once the transaction is found to be suspicious, belief is updated according to its similarity with malicious or genuine transaction history using Bayesian learning. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed intrusion detection system can effectively detect intrusive attacks in databases without raising too many false alarms.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925094","Bayesian learning;Database security;Dempster-Shafer theory;Intrusion detection;Suspicion score","Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Computer security;Data security;Database systems;History;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Transaction databases","belief networks;database management systems;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;security of data","Bayesian learning component;Dempster-Shafer theory;belief combination component;database intrusion detection;first level inference;rule-based component;security sensitive history database component","","2","","4","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful or even devastating attacks against the routing protocols, including sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. The situation is further aggravated by mobile and harsh network conditions. Traditional cryptographic techniques or efforts at developing trust-aware routing protocols do not effectively address this severe problem. To secure the WSNs against adversaries misdirecting the multihop routing, we have designed and implemented TARF, a robust trust-aware routing framework for dynamic WSNs. Without tight time synchronization or known geographic information, TARF provides trustworthy and energy-efficient route. Most importantly, TARF proves effective against those harmful attacks developed out of identity deception; the resilience of TARF is verified through extensive evaluation with both simulation and empirical experiments on large-scale WSNs under various scenarios including mobile and RF-shielding network conditions. Further, we have implemented a low-overhead TARF module in TinyOS; as demonstrated, this implementation can be incorporated into existing routing protocols with the least effort. Based on TARF, we also demonstrated a proof-of-concept mobile target detection application that functions well against an antidetection mechanism.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081880","Wireless sensor networks;routing protocols;security.","Base stations;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","RF-shielding network;Sybil attacks;TARF;TinyOS;WSN;cryptographic techniques;geographic information;multihop routing;proof-of-concept mobile target detection;replaying routing information;sinkhole attacks;synchronization;trust-aware routing framework;trust-aware routing protocols;wireless sensor networks;wormhole attacks","","14","","38","","2011-11-15","March-April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A good way to identify malicious use is through monitoring unusual user activity. To identify these malicious activities various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. This paper proposes Self Configuring Intrusion Detection System (SCIDS) to make tuning automatically. The key idea is to use the binary SLIPPER as a basic module, which is a rule learner based on confidence-rated boosting. This system is evaluated using the NSL KDD intrusion detection dataset. An experimental result shows the SCIDS system with SLIPPER algorithm gives better performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, total misclassification cost and cost per example on NSL-KDD dataset than that of on KDD.","","978-1-4673-2981-1","","10.1109/CICN.2012.181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375215","Confidence value;Intrusion;anomaly detection;attacks;false prediction;misuse detection;tuning","Classification algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Prediction algorithms;Training;Tuning","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","NSL KDD intrusion detection dataset;SCIDS system;SLIPPER algorithm;automatic tuning;binary SLIPPER;computer network;confidence-rated boosting;data mining technique;detection rate;false alarm rate;machine learning technique;malicious activity;malicious use identification;misclassification cost;modern computer system;rule learning;self-configuring intrusion detection system;tuning process;unusual user activity monitoring","","0","","25","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being able to react quickly and in real time is a crucial challenge for the security officers in charge of maintaining those infrastructures operationally. Our state of the art in this field has highlighted that many architectures exist to dynamically support the reaction after the detection of an incident infrastructure. Those architectures are mostly elaborated based on a multi-agent system approach that offers the possibility to work in a decentralized and heterogeneous environment. However, in the meantime, we have observed that those architectures are based on a static assignment of functions to agents and that, as a consequence, isolating an agent or breaking the communication channel between two of them could create serious damage on the management of the crisis. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for making the assignment of functions to agents in the critical architecture dynamic. Our approach exploits the concept of agent responsibility that we assign dynamically to those agents depending on the crisis type and severity. Simultaneously we explain the dynamic assignment of the access rights necessary to perform the obligation linked to these new responsibilities. This dynamic assignment of responsibilities is illustrated based on the architecture defined in the ReD project.","","978-1-4577-0979-1","978-0-7695-4485-4","10.1109/ARES.2011.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6045946","","Business;Computer architecture;Context;Databases;Monitoring;Permission","multi-agent systems;security of data;software architecture;ubiquitous computing","ReD project;communication channel;context-aware solution;crisis access right management;critical IT infrastructures;critical architecture dynamic;critical electronic institutions;dynamic responsibilities assignment;incident infrastructure;multiagent system","","2","","20","","","22-26 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster. The proposed policy was developed and tested on a load balancing framework called CLOUDIZER, and the performance of the strategy was compared over the traditional algorithms.","","978-1-4673-0673-7","978-1-4673-0672-0","10.1109/IConSCS.2012.6502459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502459","Bloom Filter;Caching;Load balancing","","Web services;cache storage;cloud computing;data structures;quality of service;resource allocation","CLOUDIZER;WACA policy;Web clusters;Web services;bloom filter based cache summary;centralized load balancing algorithm;cloud computing;data-sets;information retrieval time;load balancing framework;load distribution strategy;multimedia data;quality of service requirements;sensor data;traditional algorithms;user satisfaction;workload and cache aware load balancing policy","","0","","11","","","29-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

The core of this architecture, a novel energy efficient, disruption tolerant, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocol (EERD), provides offloading data for long term storage by sending data to farm servers via sinks that are a part of a MANET and handles in-situ queries issued by users collocated with the animals. The energy efficiency is achieved by dynamic adaptation to the current behavior of the animals carrying the monitoring devices. We discuss the practical feasibility of this architecture by analyzing data from the extensive field experiments we performed. We address the challenges posed by the practical deployment.

In this paper we have proposed an Application Intrusion Detection System tool which can detect & prevent web application attacks at the time of occurrence. We have implemented proposed approach with ASP.NET web application and also perform Chi Square test to validate our assumptions. Once completed SWART has future potential to detect and prevent maximum attacks with less complexity.","","978-1-4799-1374-9","","10.1109/ICCCCM.2013.6648920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6648920","IDPS;Intrusion Detection System;Web Application Attacks;Web Application Firewall;Web Application Security","Authentication;Databases;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Servers;Testing","organisational aspects;security of data;statistical testing","ASP.NET Web application;Cenzic 2013 report;Chi Square test;SWART tool;Secure Web Application Response Tool;Web application attack detection;Web application attack prevention;Web application vulnerabilities;Web applications attacks;application intrusion detection system tool;business logic;design flaws;implementation bugs;malicious users;organization database;organization reputation;secure code writing;secure logic;security awareness","","0","","27","","","3-4 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to lack of MANETs infrastructure and well defined perimeter MANETs are susceptible to a variety of attacker types. To develop a strong security scheme it is necessary to understand how malicious nodes can attack the MANETs. Focusing on the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol an IDS mechanism to accurately detect misbehavior node(s) in OLSR protocol based on End-to-End (E2E) communication between the source and the destination is proposed. The simulation results showed that the proposed mechanism is able to detect any number of attackers while keeping a reasonably low overhead in terms of network traffic.","","978-1-4244-8844-5","978-1-4244-8845-2","10.1109/ICCTD.2010.5646054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5646054","IDS;MANETs;OLSR","Ad hoc networks;Artificial neural networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;safety systems","IDS;end-to-end communication;intrusion detection systems;misbehavior nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;optimized link state routing protocol","","0","","24","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid intrusion detection system by using accelerated genetic algorithm and rough set theory (AGAAR) for data feature reduction, and genetic programming with local search (GPLS) for data classification. The AGAAR method is used to select the most relevant attributes that can represent an intrusion detection dataset. In order to improve the performance of GPLS classifier, a new local search strategy is used with genetic programming operators. The main target of using local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the current. The results shown later indicate that classification accuracy improved from 75.98% to 81.44% after using AGAAR attribute reduction for the NSL-KDD dataset. The classification accuracies have been compared with others algorithms and shown that the proposed method can be one of the competitive classifiers for IDS.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176208","Data Classification;Genetic Algorithm;Genetic Programming;Intrusion Detection Systems","Acceleration;Accuracy;Genetic algorithms;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Search problems;Set theory","evolutionary computation;pattern classification;rough set theory;security of data","AGAAR;GPLS;IDS;NSL-KDD dataset;accelerated genetic algorithm and rough set theory;attack behaviors;data classification;data feature reduction;genetic programming operators;genetic programming with local search;hybrid evolutionary algorithms;hybrid intrusion detection system;intrusion detection dataset;malicious behaviors","","0","","22","","","1-3 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, blacklists must be updated because malicious URLs tend to be short-lived and their sub strings may be partially mutated to avoid blacklisting. Due to these characteristics, it can be assumed that unknown malicious URLs exist in the neighborhood of known malicious URLs, created by the same adversary. We propose an effective blacklist URL generation method. We try to discover the URLs in the neighborhood of a malicious URL by using a search engine. Those suspicious neighborhoods around malicious URLs require further investigation to determine their blacklisting candidacy. We experimentally evaluated the proposed generation method by using real blacklisted URLs for both drive-by-download and click-download infection. The results showed that the proposed method can effectively improve identification of malicious URLs and maintenance of the coverage of blacklists.","","978-1-4577-0531-1","978-0-7695-4423-6","10.1109/SAINT.2011.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004128","blacklist;drive-by-download;web-based malware","Browsers;Focusing;Internet;Malware;Monitoring;Search engines;Servers","Internet;Web sites;invasive software;search engines","Web-based malware;blacklist URL generation method;click-download infection;drive-by-download infection;malicious URL;malicious Web sites;search engine;structural neighborhood searching","","2","1","25","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presented approach based on FSM focuses at recognizing the malicious nodes within the network in a fast and accurate way, then it deals with rapid introduction of the malicious nodes to other nodes in the network to prevent sending multiple packets and drop and packet change.

Large volume and low quality of log files justify the need for further log processing. The manual log processing is lack of flexibility. It is time consuming, and one doesn't get the general view of the log files in the network. Without this general view it is hard to correlate information between the network components. Events seemingly unessential by themselves can in reality be a piece of a larger threat. In this regard, different log correlation methods are proposed to improve alert quality and to give a comprehensive view of system security. In this paper, we show how different attacks categorized in three categories with different behavior: Denial of service (DoS) attacks, user-to-root (U2R) & remote-to-local (R2L) attacks and probing, are reflected in different logs and argue that some attacks are not evident when a single log is analyzed.","","978-1-4244-4171-6","978-1-4244-4173-0","10.1109/ISI.2009.5137316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137316","Anomaly Detection;Computer Security;Intrusion Detection;Logs Correlation;Misuse Detection","Artificial intelligence;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Correlation;Information analysis;Information security;Intersymbol interference;Intrusion detection;USA Councils","security of data","denial-of-service attacks;intrusion detection;log correlation methods;log file entries;logs correlation;network administrators;probing;remote-to-local attacks;system security;user-to-root attacks","","0","","","","","8-11 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
