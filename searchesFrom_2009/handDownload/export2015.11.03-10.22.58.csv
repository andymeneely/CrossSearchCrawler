An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power while switching of gates and reduces the wiring-crises. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that makes use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an approach using artificial intelligence technique with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918856","digital world;electronic circuit;rough set","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Artificial intelligence;Educational institutions;Electronic circuits;Logic gates;Set theory","logic gates;rough set theory","artificial intelligence based approach;circuit miniaturization;decision rules;electronic circuit;rough set theory","","0","","7","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since many diverse hosts and network configurations coexist in a cloud network, it is essential to protect each of them in the cloud network from threats. To do this, basically, we can employ existing network security devices, but applying them to a cloud network requires more considerations for its complexity, dynamism, and diversity. In this paper, we propose a new framework, CloudWatcher, which provides monitoring services for large and dynamic cloud networks. This framework automatically detours network packets to be inspected by pre-installed network security devices. In addition, all these operations can be implemented by writing a simple policy script, thus, a cloud network administrator is able to protect his cloud network easily.

This algorithm takes as its input the security alerts generated by a NIDS and, through a pseudo-bayesian alert correlation, is able to identify those that are likely to belong to the same multistep attack scenario.

It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","1","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such information can be used to verify web alerts generated by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Web Intrusion Detection Systems (Web IDSs). In this paper, we propose a method to verify web alerts generated by mentioned sensors. The goal of the alert verification component is to eliminate or tag alerts that do not represent successful attacks. Our approach is based on analyzing HTTP Transaction metadata, including Request method, Request Headers, Status Code, and Response Headers. We implemented an alert verification module, reconfigured ModSecurity, modified a subset of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and developed knowledge-base of web attack vectors to evaluate our method. We show that our approach significantly reduces false and non-relevant alerts with quite low processing overhead, thus enhances the quality of the results.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994044","HTTP Protocol;Intrusion Detection System;Web Application Firewall;alert verification;web attack","Accuracy;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Protocols;Web servers","Internet;computer network security;hypermedia;meta data;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;HTTP transaction metadata analysis;OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set;WAF;Web IDS;Web application firewalls;Web attack;Web attack vector knowledge-base;Web driven alert verification;Web intrusion detection systems;Web server;alert verification module;reconfigured ModSecurity;request headers;request method;status code","","0","","20","","","3-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although VPN technology is very useful, it imposes security threats on the remote network because its firewall does not know what traffic is flowing inside the VPN Tunnel. To address this issue, we propose Advance Oblivious comparison and VGuard, a framework that allows a Client and Server to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy. An efficient protocol, called Xhash, for Advance Oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of Guard is to first convert a firewall policy to non-overlapping numerical rules and then uses Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. After then datas were transferred from vpn server to home network.","","978-1-4673-0213-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215614","Network Security;Privacy;Virtual Private Networks","Artificial neural networks;Fires;Security;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;home networks;protocols;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","VGuard;VPN server;VPN technology;VPN tunnel;Xhash protocol;advance oblivious comparison;client;encrypted tunnel;firewall policy;home network;remote network;roaming user;security threat;traffic;virtual private network","","0","","10","","","30-31 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An integer program for Open Locating Dominating sets and its results on the hexagon-triangle infinite grid and other graphs","Sweigart, D.B.; Presnell, J.; Kincaid, R.","","Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS), 2014","20140612","2014","","","29","32","This paper presents an integer linear program (ILP) for the identification of Open Locating Dominating Sets (OLD) of minimum cardinality and presents several results of the ILP on various graphs. The OLD is similar to an identifying code, but for an open neighborhood instead of closed. The OLD was introduced by Peter Slater and Suk J. Seo in 2010 as a method by which one could identify the location of an event at a node where a node in the set can detect events at adjacent nodes, but cannot detect an event at itself. This is perhaps more clear as a series of factories such that those with intrusion detection devices form an identifying code, but an intruder will disable the system at the factory into which she breaks, if so equipped. There are also applications in other areas such as router networks. This paper continues work by Alison Oldham at the College of William and Mary on the development and implementation of an ILP to identify such OLDs on finite graphs. We demonstrate and compare the results on 100 node randomly generated graphs of various constructions; Erdös-Renyi, Geometric and Scale-Free. We find that most graphs have a density near 1/3. We also explore the use of the ILP to generate OLDs for infinite grids, looking specifically at the hexagonal-triangular grid where we discover a new upper bound of 5/12 on the minimum density OLD for this grid. Finally, we extend this ILP to identify locating dominating sets that simultaneously satisfy open and closed neighborhood criteria, or Closed-Open Locating Dominating sets (COLD).","","978-1-4799-4837-6","","10.1109/SIEDS.2014.6829887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829887","Closed-Open Locating Dominating Set;Integer Linear Program;Open Locating Dominating Set","Contamination;Diseases;Educational institutions;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Production facilities;Upper bound","graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;set theory","ILP;closed-open locating dominating sets;finite graphs;hexagon-triangle infinite grid;integer linear program;integer program;intrusion detection devices","","0","","4","","","25-25 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These types of WSN rely on cluster heads for data aggregation and transmission towards sink node. Subsequently cluster head nodes are outfitted with high energy. Conventional hierarchical routing protocols were not created considering security; they are helpless against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed. Among the various Denial of Service attacks, Flooding attacks consumes the maximum battery life of the sensor node, on the other hand Gray hole attack consumes the minimum battery life of the nodes. Thus based on energy these attacks are distinguished and isolated from the network using the proposed IDS and extensive simulations are carried out using NS2- MANNASIM framework.","","978-1-4799-9854-8","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225410","Cluster head;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray hole attack;Hierarchical routing;IDS","Computer crime;Delays;Energy consumption;Floods;Intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attacks;NS2-MANNASIM framework;cluster head nodes;data aggregation;data transmission;denial of service attacks;detection complexity;distributed flooding detection;distributed intrusion detection scheme;energy savings;gray hole attacks;hierarchical routing protocols;information supply process;sink node;wireless sensor network","","0","","10","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS. These simulations will quantify network throughput and device battery usage in large scale network deployments that are, and are not, using B-SIPS.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3450-3","","10.1109/HICSS.2009.394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755621","","Batteries;Bluetooth;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection;Research initiatives;Sensor systems;Testing;Throughput","Bluetooth;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Battery-Sensing Intrusion Protection System research;Bluetooth;Wi-Fi;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;device battery usage;mobile devices;multi-vector attacks;network deployment validation;network simulations;network throughput;saturated network environment;throughput degradation;transmission rate","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.","","978-1-4577-1459-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432","","Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training","Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing","CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs","","1","","18","","","5-6 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one such miracle of the wireless technology which opens up the new dimensions for the researchers to write the technology of the future i.e. ubiquitous computing and intelligence. Nevertheless nature has played its ultimate role as well to give an idea of perfection in optimizing the teething issues in any field and so in WSN. Design and deployment, localization, routing and clustering, QoS management, security etc are few scenarios in WSN. The computational intelligence paradigm (CI) inspired by nature, comprising artificial neural network (ANN), artificial immune system (AIS), evolutionary algorithm (EA), swarm intelligence (SI) and fuzzy logic (FL). These are different flavors for increasing efficiency in terms of memory and computational power which alternatively affects other issues towards perfection i.e. convenience and intelligence. Hybrid and non hybrid algorithms optimizes the issues through CI paradigms, which are presented in this research article relevant to Wireless Sensor Network. Our findings strongly recommend development of hybrid CI based algorithms to address combinatorial optimizing issues in WSN.","","978-1-4577-1553-2","","10.1109/ICICT.2011.5983561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983561","Computational intelligence (CI);Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and hybrid computational intelligence","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational intelligence;Fuzzy logic;Optimization;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","artificial intelligence;optimisation;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","AIS;ANN;FL;QoS management;SI;artificial immune system;artificial neural network;computational intelligence based optimization;fuzzy logic;swarm intelligence;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor network","","1","","35","","","23-24 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection. A hybrid detection framework is developed to detect anomalous and malicious activities by incorporating our proposed grid sensor placement algorithm with observability analysis to increase the detection rate.

Due to these particularities, classical routing protocols cannot be used and some specific ones have been proposed. Because routing process is fundamental in a MANET deployment, it constitutes a privileged target of attackers. In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2013.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258","Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security","Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols","","1","","9","","","2-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, the number of alerts becomes unmanageable including actual alerts mixed with false alerts. Therefore, improved techniques are needed. The general idea in this paper is to introduce collaboration achieved by taking advantage of various kinds of contextual information and thus enable IDS to correctly identify successful attacks while simultaneously reducing the number of false positives. In this paper, a multilevel event correlation structure is proposed by firstly assigning each alert a value of confidence using contextual information and then correlates the preprocessed alerts based on improved temporal causal correlation combining with confidence value. At the end, a scenario graph and a high-level alert with final confidence are presented, which indicates the reliability of attacks launched through specific path.

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead. What's more, in the case of crash occurrence, the ATEP scheme is still able to maintain rather steady throughput without sudden decrease.","","978-1-4244-7422-6","978-1-4244-7421-9","10.1109/SNPD.2010.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521501","ATEP;controllability;crash detection;flow-driven;quick crash recovery","Artificial intelligence;Computer crashes;Controllability;Intrusion detection;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Throughput;Vehicle crash testing;Yarn","security of data","active two-threshold scheme;data preserving overhead;flow-level controllability;ideal exit-point;network intrusion detection system;packet loss;packet-driven NIDS;packet-driven systems;quick crash recovery mechanism;software crashes","","1","","14","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine. In this paper we propose a new Real Time Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection System (RTUNIDS) which monitor network flows in two windows with different sizes and detects network attacks by correlating outliers from multiple clusters. The proposed solution has the ability of detecting different types of intrusions in realtime such as DOS, DDOS, scanning, distribution of worms and any other network attacks which produce huge amount of network traffic and in the meanwhile it detects Bot-Master if the detected attack lunched by Bots.","","978-1-4673-5137-9","","10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747642","","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","Bot-Master detection;DDOS;NIDS solutions;RTU-NIDS;attack-free dataset;byte monitoring;engine training;misuse detection mechanism;network behavior matching;network flow monitoring;network traffic;packet payload monitoring;predefined attack signatures;real time multistage unsupervised intelligent engine;real time unsupervised network intrusion detection system;scanning;semisupervised anomaly detection systems;unknown attack detection rate enhancement;worm distribution;zero day attacks","","0","","27","","","23-25 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator. Simulation results show high performances regarding the detection rate of malicious nodes and overhead with an amelioration of the end-to-end communication delay in the presence of malicious vehicles.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036788","Clustering;Monitoring;Reputation;Routing;Security;VANET","Ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Roads;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","routing protocols;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","NS3 simulator;S-GyTAR;VANET;data collection;data routing;distributed trust management strategy;greedy forwarding technique;secure intersection-based routing protocol;urban vehicular networks","","0","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems.

It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host.

Different from the general distributed frameworks, e.g., MapReduce, our framework is specifically designed for security log analysis. It features a minimum set of necessary properties, such as dynamic task scheduling for streaming logs. For prototyping, we implement our framework in Amazon cloud environments (EC2 and S3) with a basic analysis application.

However, in comparison to wired network or infrastructure-based wireless network, MANET is particularly vulnerable to security attacks due to its fundamental characteristics, e.g., the open medium, dynamic network topology, autonomous terminal, lack of centralized monitoring and management. The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network.

Our proposal combines the characteristics of data mining techniques with a continuous stream of input data, and with high processing performance GPU architecture. Results show that our approach provides accuracy comparable to or better than existing related work (e.g., above 95%) while ramping up performance (e.g., up to 62x speed up), comparing the different implementations of our approach.

A formal model for an agent for masquerade detection is then derived which discerns the static attributes of the user as well as detects anomalies in the dynamic user behavior via a statistical classifier.

But network intrusions are now becoming more and more sophisticated to detect, thus, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) have been proposed which enables an IDS to collect information and learn experience from other IDS nodes. By maintaining interactions among a set of IDS nodes, a CIDN is expected to be more powerful in detecting some complicated attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) than a single IDS. In real deployment, we identify that each IDS may have different levels of sensitivity in detecting different types of intrusions (i.e., based on their own signatures and settings). In this paper, we therefore define a notion of intrusion sensitivity and investigate the feasibility of using it to evaluate the trustworthiness of an IDS node. In addition, we describe several challenges when using this notion in practice. In the evaluation, the experimental results indicate that the use of intrusion sensitivity is feasible and encouraging to enhance the accuracy of detecting malicious nodes.","","978-1-4799-2548-3","","10.1109/CIS.2013.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746483","Collaborative Intrusion Detection Network;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Sensitivity;Trust Management","Accuracy;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Robustness;Sensitivity","computer crime;groupware;trusted computing","CIDN;DoS attack;IDS nodes;attacks identification;collaborative intrusion detection networks;denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection systems;intrusion sensitivity;malicious nodes detection;trust evaluation;trustworthiness","","0","","24","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And there is a lack of information visibility. Organizations must bridge the gap between technical cyber operations and the business/social priorities since both sides are essential for ensuring cyber security. Identifying visual structures for information synthesis could help reduce the complexity while increasing information visibility within organizations. This paper lays the foundation for investigating such visual structures by first identifying where current visual structures are succeeding or failing. To do this, we examined publicly available analyses related to three types of security issues: 1) epidemic, 2) cyber attacks on an industrial network, and 3) threat of terrorist attack. We found that existing visual structures are largely inadequate for reducing complexity and improving information visibility. However, based on our analysis, we identified a range of different visual structures, and their possible trade-offs/limitation is framing strategies for cyber policy. These structures form the basis of evolving visualization to support information synthesis for policy actions, which has rarely been done but is promising based on the efficacy of existing visualizations for cyber incident detection, attacks, and situation awareness.","2325-5366","978-9-9499-5442-1","","10.1109/CYCON.2015.7158474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158474","cyber security policy;human-computer interaction;organizations;visual structures;visualization","Complexity theory;Computer security;Data visualization;Organizations;Terrorism;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data;terrorism","Verizon 2014 Data Breach Report;cyber attacks;cyber incident detection;cyber policy strategies;cyber security;information synthesis;information visibility;situation awareness;terrorist attack;visual structures","","0","","19","","","26-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of current networks implement Misuse detection or Anomaly detection techniques for Intrusion detection. By deploying misuse based IDS it cannot detect unknown intrusions and anomaly based IDS have high false positive rate for detection. To overcome this, proposed system uses combination of both network based and host based IDPS as Hybrid Intrusion Detection and Prevention System which will be helpful for detecting maximum attacks on networks.","","978-1-4799-9854-8","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225396","anomaly based;attacks;classification;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;misuse based","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computers;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IDS;IMMIX-intrusion detection system;IMMIX-intrusion prevention system;anomaly detection;computer network security;misuse detection;non-hostile traffic","","0","","12","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when an IM is fed by a frequency converter, the spectral analysis of stator current signal becomes difficult. For this reason, the monitoring must depend on multiple signatures in order to reduce the effect of harmonic disturbance on the motor-phase current. The aim of this paper is the description of a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis of IMs using signal-based method. It is based on signal processing and an unsupervised classification technique called the artificial ant clustering. The proposed approach is tested on a squirrel-cage IM of 5.5 kW in order to detect broken rotor bars and bearing failure at different load levels.

Some others may act malicious by launching security attacks like denial of service or hack the information. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users.

So far no classification of such mobile P2P security threats exists. There is no well known simulation environment to model mobile P2P network characteristics and provide a platform for the analysis of the propagation of different types of mobile malware. Therefore, our research provides a classification of mobile malware based on the behaviour of a node during infection and develops a platform to analyse malware propagation. It proposes and evaluates a novel behaviour-based approach, using AI, for the detection of various malware families. Unlike existing approaches, our approach focuses on identifying and classifying malware families rather than detecting individual malware and their variants. Adaptive detection of currently known and previously unknown mobile malware on designated mobile nodes through a deployed detection framework aided by AI classifiers enables successful detection. Although we have classified around 30% of the existing mobile P2P malware into 13 distinct malware families based on their behaviour during infection, this paper focuses on two, Cabir & Commwarrior, in order to analyse the proposed detection framework.","","978-1-4577-1931-8","","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113305","MPeersim;Malware Classification;Malware Detection;Malware Families;Malware Propagation;Mobile Agents;Mobile P2P Networks","Analytical models;Batteries;Bluetooth;Grippers;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","computer network security;computer viruses;invasive software;mobile agents;mobile computing;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing","AI classifier;Cabir families;Commwarrior families;behaviour-based approach;malware family classification;mobile P2P malware detection framework;mobile malware classification;mobile network security;mobile node;mobile spyware;mobile trojan;mobile virus;mobile worm","","0","","18","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not. Simulation shows that CPDFA structure can save about 90% of memory storage comparing with the original DFA structure. By using pipelined architecture in FPGA, CPDFA can advance one character in one memory access cycle.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198833","","Application software;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Pattern matching;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security","DFA Structure;deterministic finite automata;indirect index;multiple regular expressions matching;parallel SRAMs;real-time deep packet inspection;regular expression matcher","","1","","13","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, it is easy to deploy and terminate large number of malicious virtual machines (VMs) in a few seconds while the administrator is probably difficult to identify these malicious VMs immediately. These features open doors for attackers to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that target at degrading the quality of cloud service. This paper studies an attack scenario that malicious tenants use cloud resources to launch DoS attack targeting at data center subnets. Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors. We conduct our experiments in the campus-wide data center, and the results show our detection system can promptly and accurately response to DoS attacks.","","978-1-4799-8086-4","","10.1109/CBD.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176094","Attack Detection;Cloud Data Center;DoS Attack;Information Entropy","","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security;data flow analysis;entropy;system monitoring;virtual machines","CPU usage;DoS attack;attack behavior;attack identification;campus-wide data center;cloud data center;cloud resources;cloud service quality degradation;data center subnets;data flow based detection;data flow pattern;entropy-based denial of service attack detection;information entropy;malicious VM;malicious tenants;malicious virtual machines;network resource isolation;network usage;virtual machine status monitoring","","0","","21","","","20-22 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the contrary, BIOS of new computer systems (servers, laptops, desktops, network devices, and other embedded systems) can be easily upgraded using a flash or capsule mechanism which can add new vulnerabilities either through malicious code, or by accidental incidents, and deliberate attack. The recent attack on Iranian Nuclear Power Plant (Stuxnet) [1:2] is an example of advanced persistent attack. This attack vector adds a new dimension into the information security (IS) spectrum, which needs to be guarded by implementing a holistic approach employed at enterprise level. Malicious BIOS upgrades can also cause denial of service, stealing of information or addition of new backdoors which can be exploited by attackers for causing business loss, passive eaves dropping or total destruction of system without knowledge of user. To address this challenge a capability for verification of BIOS integrity needs to be developed and due diligence must be observed for proactive resolution of the issue.

Misleading of data shows many financial losses in all kind of network based environments. Day by day new vulnerabilities are detected in networking and computer products that lead to new emerging problems. One of the new prevention techniques for network threats is Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Feature selection is the major challenging issues in IDS in order to reduce the useless and redundant features among the attributes (e.g. attributes in KDD cup'99, an Intrusion Detection Data Set). In this paper, we aim to reduce feature vector space by calculating distance relation between features with Information Measure (IM) by evaluating the relation between feature and class to enhance the feature selection. Here we incorporate the Information Measure (IM) method with k-means Cluster Triangular Area Based Support Vector Machine (CTSVM) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to detect intrusion attacks. By dealing with both continuous and discrete attributes, our proposed method extracts best features with high Detection Rate (DR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).","","978-1-4673-0670-6","","10.1109/ICoAC.2011.6165213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165213","Detection Rate;False Positive Rate;Information Measure;Intrusion Detection;Support Vector Machine;k-means Clustering","Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machine classification;Training","pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","SVM classifier;attacker threat;continuous attribute;detection rate;discrete attribute;false positive rate;feature selection;feature vector space;information measure;intrusion detection;k-means cluster triangular area based support vector machine;network based application;security threat;support vector machines;threat prevention technique;triangle SVM;vulnerability detection","","1","","15","","","14-16 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Contrary to existing detectors that passively observe packets, our detector analyses logs so as to identify patterns of misuse and proactively collaborate with others to gather additional evidences. As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node. The main challenge stems from difficulty involved in stating the occurrence of an attack based on second-hands evidences that may come from colluding attacker (s). To tackle this issue, we propose an entropy-based trust system that evaluates the trustworthiness of the nodes that provide the evidences.

The HAN controller, which acts as a gateway, should not cause any delay by decrypting and re-encrypting the packets, nor should it has any chance to modify them. Considering the required level of security and quality of service, we design our protocol with an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) approach. We improve and implement the Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol in two steps. First, we propose an auxiliary mechanism that is an ECC version of PAKE, and then extend it to a multilayer consensus model. We reduce the number of hash functions to one, and utilize a primitive password shared between an appliance and HAN controller to construct four valid individual consensus and authenticated symmetric keys between the appliance and upstream controllers by exchanging only 12 packets. Security analysis presents that our protocol is resilient to various attacks. Furthermore, performance analysis shows that the delay caused by the security process is reduced by more than one half.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2226252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471884","Access control;ECC;ECDH;PAKE;consensus;hierarchical control;multilayer;security;smart grid","","access control;control engineering computing;cryptographic protocols;domestic appliances;file organisation;home networks;internetworking;network servers;power system control;power system security;public key cryptography;quality of service;smart power grids","ECC approach;HAN);MCEPAK protocol;PAKE;access control;appliance-device;elliptic curve cryptography approach;gateway;hash function;home area network;multilayer consensus ECC-based password authenticated key-exchange protocol;packet decryption;packet reencryption;quality of service;security process;smart grid system","","2","","29","","","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems either focus on just one layer of observation or use a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. This paper describes a synergistic approach of fusing decisions of whether an attack takes place by using multiple measurements from different layers of wireless communication networks. The described method is implemented on a live system that monitors a wireless network in real time and gives an indication of whether a malicious frame exists or not. This is achieved by analysing specific metrics and comparing them against historical data. The proposed system assigns for each metric a belief of whether an attack takes place or not. The beliefs from different metrics are fused with the Dempster-Shafer technique with the ultimate goal of limiting false alarms by combining beliefs from various network layers. The on-line experimental results show that cross-layer techniques and data fusion perform more efficiently compared to conventional methods.","","978-1-4577-0455-0","","10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088478","Cross-layer measurements;Data fusion;Dempster-Shafer;Wi-Fi;Wireless attacks","Intrusion detection;Measurement;Monitoring;Real time systems;Web sites;Wireless networks","inference mechanisms;radiocommunication;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer technique;computer network;cross-layer technique;intrusion detection system;malicious frame;multilayer data fusion;online wireless attack detection system;synergistic approach;wireless communication network","","0","","11","","","10-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since MFs are transmitted without encryption or authentication, attackers can easily launch various attacks by forging the MFs. In a collaborative environment with many Wi-Fi sniffers, such attacks can be easily detected by sensing the anomaly RSS changes. However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method. We observe about 8 times improvement by CSITE over RSS-based method on the falsely accepted attacking frames.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-5944-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567061","","Authentication;Cryptography;Decorrelation;IEEE 802.11n Standard;OFDM","telecommunication channels;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11n;CSI information;CSITE;PHY layer;RSS-based method;Txpower;Wi-Fi management frames;Wi-Fi sniffers;channel dynamics;channel state information;rapid spatial decorrelation;source authentication;user mobility","","1","","29","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although STP is widely used, it is still prone to many kinds of attacks that exploit the lack of security features both in basic working process and STP packet format. By exploiting STP control packet an attacker can pretend to be the new root in STP domain and perform unauthorized activities that lead to root take-over attack, STP control packet flooding, traffic redirection and so on. In this paper, a coverage based distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) has been introduced, for the detection of attacks on STP. The proposed scheme computes a set of switches in the network that can cover the STP network completely; where every switch belongs to that set is installed with a small module of IDS. This set of IDSs logically divides the STP network into a set of local zones. All the switches in a zone is directly connected to one switch installed with IDS and thus covered by at least one IDS in STP domain. Each IDS can detect and verify any exploit inside its local zone. Additionally IDSs communicate with each other so that any exploit outside the local zone of a particular IDS can also be detected and verified. The results show that the proposed DIDS approach can detect all the STP based attacks.","","978-1-4673-0127-5","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141374","","Bridges;Delay;Local area networks;Network topology;Probes;Protocols;Topology","computer network management;computer network security;protocols","DIDS;STP control packet flooding;STP packet format;computer network;coverage based distributed intrusion detection system;distributed IDS;exploit detection techniques;link layer protocol;link management;loop formation prevention;root take-over attack;security features;spanning tree protocol;traffic redirection","","1","","19","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are several techniques which exist at present to provide more security to the network, but most of these techniques are static. Test the proposed method by a benchmark intrusion dataset to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. Results show that choosing good attributes and samples will not only have impact on the performance, but also on the overall execution efficiency.
