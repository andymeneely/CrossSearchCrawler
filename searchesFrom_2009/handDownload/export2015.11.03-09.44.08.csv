Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques. Finally, some significant research problems are identified for enlightening the subsequent studies.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2257594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942184","Cyber-physical system (CPS);intrusion detection;security;security.","Actuators;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Real-time systems;Reliability;Security;Sensors","control engineering computing;embedded systems;industrial control;production engineering computing;security of data","CPS;critical infrastructures;cyber attacks;cyber-physical systems;detection techniques;embedded computers;industrial control systems;instruction detection mechanism;physical processes","","0","","51","","2014-10-31","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A single zero-day vulnerability would permit an attacker to access all information. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for performing policy-based security monitoring. We use policies to distribute information across several hosts, so that any host compromise has limited impact on the confidentiality of the data about the overall system.

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset. This also implies that the BNMA is beneficial in accelerating the detection process due to its less dependance on the potentially prolonged process of collecting large training datasets.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903117","Bayesian Model Averaging;Bayesian network;Intrusion detection system;detection accuracy","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training","belief networks;pattern classification;security of data;statistical analysis","BN classifiers;BNMA classifier;Bayesian model averaging;Bayesian network classifiers;KDD Cup 99 dataset;NSL-KDD dataset;detection accuracy;heuristic methods;intrusion detection;probability distribution;reasoning capabilities","","0","","27","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An efficient pattern matching algorithm plays an important role in NIDS. There have been many proposed methods for pattern matching algorithms. Traditionally, the multi-character NFA that is capable of matching multiple characters per cycle can be built by duplicating entire circuit of 1-character architecture. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing based architecture to improve the original multi-character architecture. The design of the proposed architecture and its implementation in FPGA are described in details. Our simulation results show that the proposed architecture performs better than all the existing Brute-Force based approaches in terms of the throughput and the slice utilization. Specifically, the proposed architectures of 2-character and 4-character designs can achieve the throughputs of 4.68 and 7.27 Gbps and the slice utilization of 2.86 and 2.10 in terms of char/slice, respectively.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-6695-5","","10.1109/AINA.2010.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474723","Finite state machine;Intrusion detection;Multi-character;Pattern matching","Application software;Automata;Clocks;Computer architecture;Costs;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput","Internet;computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;finite state machines;pattern matching","Brute-Force;FPGA;NFA pattern matching architecture;Network Intrusion Detection System;bit rate 4.68 Gbit/s to 7.27 Gbit/s;deterministic finite automata;field programmable gate array;finite state machines;network attacks detection;network intrusion detection system;original multicharacter architecture","","1","","16","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks. ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.","1545-0678","978-1-4673-1423-7","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258190","","Delay;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Inspection;Logic gates;Optimization;Upper bound","","","","0","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complexity, accessibility, and openness of the Internet have served to increase the security risk of information systems tremendously. Intrusions pose a serious security risk in a network environment. The normal and the abnormal behaviors in networked computers are hard to predict, as the boundaries cannot be well defined. This prediction process usually generates false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced, where a set of fuzzy rules is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and a fuzzy inference engine can be applied over such rules to determine intrusions. This paper proposes a technique with genetic algorithm to generate fuzzy rules instead of manual design that are able to detect anomalies and some specific intrusions. Experiments were performed with DARPA data sets, during normal behavior and intrusive behavior. This paper presents some results and reports the performance of generated fuzzy rules in classifying different types of intrusions.","","978-1-4244-8622-9","","10.1109/ITAIC.2011.6030165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030165","fuzzy classification;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Biological cells;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Training","Internet;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;security of data","DARPA data sets;Internet;anomaly based intrusion detection system;computer network;evolving fuzzy classifiers;false alarm rate;fuzzy inference engine;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithm;information security;information system;intrusive activity;intrusive behavior;network environment;prediction process;security risk","","1","","7","","","20-22 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since data are highly sensitive, organizations are reluctant to share them. In many organizations, the security team who can collect such data is not willing to share them even within the organization. The University of Maryland (UMD) plays a significant role in cybersecurity research due to a collaboration between the Office of Information Technologys (OIT) security team and UMD researchers. The result of the collaboration is access to and analysis of all security related data collected on UMD networks. The talk will review some studies conducted using the data provided by OIT. First, organizations face increasing challenges in addressing and preventing computer and network security incidents. Being able to understand and predict trends in incidents can aid an organizations ability to allocate resources for the prevention of such incidents, as well as the evaluation of mitigation strategies. We compared non-homogeneous Poisson process software reliability growth models and time series models with a large set of security incident data. Based on the over 12,000 incidents recorded since 2001, these models were compared for their prediction capability for the number of incidents. Second, security administrators lack network visibility, i.e., they often do not have the tools to monitor their networks in detail. Even though about 40,000 IP addresses are linked to UMD users, the UMD network consists of more than 130,000 IP addresses. We developed a tool called Nfsight that identifies clients, servers, and scanners solely based on network flows. Various heuristics have been applied and combined using a Bayesian method. Nfsight is currently monitoring the UMD network and the security team has integrated Nfsight into their security tool suit- - e. Nfsight has found compromised computers that were undetected by the other security tools used by the security team.","","978-1-4577-0374-4","978-1-4577-0373-7","10.1109/DSNW.2011.5958863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958863","","","","","","0","","","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both signature matching and a variety of feature-based pattern recognition methods have been applied to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must ""port over"" a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain. Finally, we also propose and evaluate a hypothesis testing approach to detect port spoofing by exploiting confusion matrix statistics.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963163","domain adaptation;flow-based classification","Accuracy;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Payloads;Protocols;Servers;Training","cryptography;pattern classification;transport protocols","confusion matrix statistics;data encryption;feature based pattern recognition method;flow classification;offline network planning;online anomaly detection;private-enterprise network;tamper-resistant feature","","4","","29","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence several algorithms have been developed to extract the most relevant set of features that contribute to the accurate classification of records.

This KDD CUP 1999 data set was generated by domain expert at MIT Lincon lab. To reduced number of features of this KDD CUP data set, various feature reduction techniques has been already used. These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al. Tesfahun's approach reduces time and complexity of model and improves the detection rate for the minority classes in a considerable amount. This work investigates the effectiveness and the feasibility of Tesfahun et al.'s feature reduction technique on Back Propagation Neural Network classifier. We had performed various experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset and recorded Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Fscore values. In this work, we had done Basic, N-Fold Validation and Testing comparisons on reduced dataset with full feature dataset. Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters. Experiments of N-Fold validation show that classifier that uses reduced dataset, have better generalization capacity. During the testing comparison, we found both the datasets are equally compatible. All the three comparisons clearly show that reduced dataset is better or is equally compatible, and does not have any drawback as compared to full dataset. Our experiments shows that usage of such reduced dataset in BPNN can lead to better model in terms of dataset size, complexity, processing time and generalization ability.","","978-1-4799-8487-9","","10.1109/ACCT.2015.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079087","Back Propagation Neural Network;Feature Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;N Fold Validation","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Power capacitors;Testing;Training","backpropagation;data handling;generalisation (artificial intelligence);neural nets","BPNN;Fscore values;IG;KDD CUP 1999 data set;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;MIT Lincon lab;anomaly detection;back propagation neural network classifier;complexity;computer network;dataset size;domain expert;feature reduction techniques;generalization ability;generalization capacity;information gain;machine learning algorithm;n-fold validation;reduced dataset","","0","","25","","","21-22 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traffic analysis capability also need to be scaled up correspondingly to handle this high traffic rates. The modern commodity platforms equipped with processors rich in number of cores and having hyper threading technology has enabled emergence of software based solutions rather than dedicated platforms for traffic analysis. But the general purpose network stacks provided by operating systems focus more on compatibility and hence are not able to fully exploit the hardware capabilities of these platforms. Lot of work is reported on customizing the stack for packet capture and achieving line rate (10 Gbps) performance on a single Network Interface Card (NIC). Some work is also reported on use of multiple 10GbE NICs for handling traffic beyond 10 Gbps. This paper brings out through experimental setup and observations the issues involved in linear scaling of performance with additional NICs on commodity Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) servers. It shows that linear scaling requires optimum configurations of compute, memory and network resources especially affinity of NICs to NUMA nodes. Using these configurations we are able to achieve linear scaling of traffic analysis capability with additional 10 GbE NICs. We report scaled performance upto 40 Gbps with the use of four NIC cards.","","978-1-4799-6870-1","","10.1109/ICDSE.2014.6974636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974636","Commodity Servers;Linear Scaling;Multiple NICs;Traffic Capture;beyond 10 Gbps","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Hardware;Program processors;Servers","network interfaces;telecommunication traffic","Internet users;NIC;NUMA nodes;commodity NUMA servers;commodity nonuniform memory access servers;compute resource;general purpose network stacks;hyper threading technology;line rate performance;linear performance scaling;memory resource;multiple network interface cards;network resource;network traffic rate;operating systems;optimum configurations;packet capture;single network interface card;software based solutions;traffic analysis capability;traffic capture","","0","","13","","","26-28 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A promising approach to this problem is to apply linear data transformation and anomaly detection techniques on top of known attack signatures that convey contextual properties. The linear data transformation technique relies on several discriminant functions, which are used to calculate the estimated probability of zero-day attacks by analyzing network connection features. The anomaly detection technique identifies zero-day attacks using the One Class Nearest Neighbor (1-class NN) algorithm, which has been applied using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to achieve dimensionality reduction. An experimental prototype has been implemented to evaluate these techniques using data from the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset. The results indicate that linear data transformation techniques are quite effective and efficient in detecting zero-day attacks.","","978-1-4799-0406-8","","10.1109/SERE.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6571706","Intrusion detection;contextual information;misuse detection;one class nearest neighbor;zero-day attack","Context;Covariance matrices;Entropy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Probability;Training","pattern classification;probability;security of data;singular value decomposition","1-class NN algorithm;IDS;NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset;SVD technique;anomaly detection technique;attack probability;attack signature;dimensionality reduction;discriminant function;intrusion detection system;linear data transformation technique;network connection feature;one class nearest neighbor;singular value decomposition;zero-day attack identification","","0","","37","","","18-20 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both NSAs and PSAs comprise of two phases: generating a set D of detectors from a given set S of selves (detector generation phase); and then detecting if a given cell (new data instance) is self or non-self using the generated detector set (detection phase).

Counterattack agent as antibody, is built in each regular node which is regarded as B-cell. When Detection agents find invaders, they send out instructions to activate the counterattack agents in the neighbor nodes of the invaders.

Suffix matching algorithms have good time efficiency, and thus are widely used. These algorithms require that all patterns in a set have the same length. When the patterns cannot satisfy this requirement, the leftmost characters, m being the length of the shortest pattern, are extracted to construct the data structure. We call such m-character strings partial strings. However, a simple extraction from the left does not address the impact of partial string locations on search speed. We propose a novel method to extract the partial strings from each pattern which maximizes search speed. More specifically, with this method we can compute all the corresponding searching time cost by theoretical derivation, and choose the location which yields an approximately minimal search time. We evaluate our method on two rule sets: Snort and ClamAV. Experiments show that in most cases, our method achieves the fastest searching speed in all possible locations of partial string extraction, and is about 5%-20% faster than the alternative methods.","","978-1-4577-0249-5","978-1-4577-0248-8","10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928778","SBOM algorithm;Wu Manber algorithm;multiple string matching;pattern matching;string matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bills of materials;Data mining;Data structures;Pattern matching;Training","Internet;feature extraction;string matching","ClamAV;Internet;Snort;Web content monitoring system;optimal partial string extraction;pattern matching;searching time cost;string matching;suffix matching algorithm","","1","","11","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection. In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA process. We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and naïve Bayes classification scheme.

First, original training dataset gained from network is divided into three subsets according to the network protocol (TCP, UDP and ICMP). Second, every subset is parted into multi-subsets and sent to parallel SVMs. Then we get multiple results from SVM trainers. The incremental learning algorithm of SVM is used to train new data sets instead of reconstructing SVM for whole data. This method improves the training efficiency by reducing the size of training subsets. At last, simulation experiments are done with KDD CUP 1999 data set. The experiment results show that the training time of SVM is shortened and the detection accuracy obtained by our method is exactly same as that obtained by others.","","978-1-4244-5227-9","978-1-4244-5228-6","10.1109/JCPC.2009.5420129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5420129","","Data security;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Parallel algorithms;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Support vector machines;Ubiquitous computing","groupware;parallel algorithms;protocols;security of data;support vector machines;ubiquitous computing","cooperative intrusion detection system;high speed network;large scale network;learning algorithm;network protocol;parallel SVM;pervasive computing;support vector machine","","0","","7","","","3-5 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time the number of network threats and attacks of various types in private and corporate networks is constantly increasing. Therefore, the development of effective methods of intrusion detection is an urgent problem at the present day. In this paper we propose a new approach to intrusion detection in computer networks based on the use of neural networks ensembles. This approach can be implemented in distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS) which better meets the challenges of the present time, in contrast to the traditional use of neural networks in host-based IDS. In the paper the basic steps of the neural networks ensembles designing are described and some of the methods to complete these steps are expounded. Peculiarities of using neural networks ensembles to solve classification problems are discussed. Then the basic scheme of neural networks ensemble approach to intrusion detection systems is proposed. Conditions and results of the experimental investigation of the proposed approach on a number of classification problems are presented, including the problem of classifying probe attacks. Possible development of the proposed approach and areas for future research are discussed in the end.","","978-1-4673-1510-4","978-1-4673-1508-1","10.1109/CEC.2012.6252986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252986","classification;ensemble approach;intrusion detection;neural networks","Biological neural networks;Computer networks;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Probes;Reliability","computer network security;neural nets;pattern classification","IDS;attack detection;classification problems;computer networks;corporate networks;intrusion detection systems;network activity;network threats;neural networks ensemble approach;private networks;probe attacks","","0","","15","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.","1542-1201","978-1-4673-0267-8","978-1-4673-0268-5","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices","","0","","19","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The security risks caused by the static nodes are avoided in the proposed scheme. The status of the nodes in the network is completely equal and the credit values that vary with the operation of the network are the only criterion to measure their responsibilities. The scheme can effectively prevent attackers from getting permission of the certificate services and could be applicable to the complex and dynamic networks.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684471","","","","","","0","","","","","December 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

What are necessary and prudent efforts when a customer calls with a major security problem that needs to be fixed with a proven, off-the-approval-list, multi-layered integrated system with high visibility and limited funding and expires at the end of the Fiscal Year? Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree, many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based on a rapid management ""guestimate."" Then a Project Manager (PM) is assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope, compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven systems via an ""Extreme Project"" is sometimes necessary. Extreme Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a highly-tailored and agile project management process with management support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the customer. This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the valuable analysis and project management techniques. Indeed, having worked on a well-planned project provides the basis for experienced team members to complete Extreme Projects.

Much work has been done in this field; however, most of the prior work results in low memory efficiency (defined as the ratio of the amount of the required storage in bytes and the size of the dictionary in number of characters). Due to such inefficiency, state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose an algorithm called ""leaf-attaching"" to preprocess a given dictionary without increasing the number of patterns. The resulting set of postprocessed patterns can be searched using any tree-search data structure. We also present a scalable, high-throughput, Memory-efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM) based on a pipelined binary search tree. The proposed algorithm and architecture achieve a memory efficiency of 0.56 (for the Rogets dictionary) and 1.32 (for the Snort dictionary). As a result, our design scales well to support larger dictionaries. Implementations on 45 nm ASIC and a state-of-the-art FPGA device (for latest Rogets and Snort dictionaries) show that our architecture achieves 24 and 3.2 Gbps, respectively. The MASM module can simply be duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves simply rewriting the content of the memory, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148214","ASIC;Aho-Corasick;DFA;Databases;Dictionaries;Memory management;Pattern matching;Rogets;Snort;String matching;Throughput;Vectors;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);leaf attaching;pipeline;reconfigurable","Databases;Dictionaries;Memory management;Pattern matching;Throughput;Vectors","Internet;application specific integrated circuits;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;storage management;string matching;tree searching","ASIC;FPGA device;MASM module;NIDS;Rogets dictionary;Snort dictionary;characters per cycle;content matching;dictionary dictionary;dictionary preprocessing;dictionary update;high-latency external DRAM;large-scale string pattern matching;leaf-attaching;malicious pattern dictionary;memory content rewriting;modular approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;pipelined binary search tree;predefined database;scalable high-throughput memory-efficient architecture;tree-search data structure","","1","","19","","2012-02-07","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In flat topology, the nodes relay every data item collected by each node towards the gateway node, thereby draining the energy of the relaying nodes soon. In a WSN application, it may not be possible to replace the batteries always. One of the basic requirements of any WSN application is energy conservation of the nodes. Using hierarchical topology, the data is collected from the nodes in the near vicinity and the same is aggregated and these aggregate values are sent to the gateway node.

In this work, we attempt to quantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key characteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the number of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree. Specifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential growth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. Through both mathematical analysis and simulation, we find that the number of children has asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on average half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98% of infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of infected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the generation follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length of the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with the total number of infected hosts. Next, we study the infection structure of localized-scanning and permutation-scanning worms through simulation and surprisingly find that the above observations also apply to these worms. Finally, we apply our findings to evaluate bot assessment strategies for forensic analysis after a worm tree has been formed.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2204981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218774","Botnet;detection;probabilistic modeling;simulation;topology;worm infection family tree","Analytical models;Grippers;Internet;Joints;Mathematical model;Measurement;Peer to peer computing","Internet;Poisson distribution;computer network security;geometry;invasive software;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics)","Internet worm infection family tree characteristics;Poisson distribution;approximate-logarithmic average path length;asymptotic geometric distribution;bot assessment strategies;botnets;children;forensic analysis;host infection ability quantification;localized-scanning worms;mathematical analysis;permutation-scanning worms;probabilistic modeling methods;security threats;sequential growth model;simulations;vulnerable host;worm infection topology","","1","","40","","2012-06-15","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Combining the two systems will result in IDPS which not only detects the attacks but also prevent such attacks to occur in the networks. Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks are the major concern for security in the collaborative networks. Although non DDOS attacks are also make the network performances poor, the effect of DDOS attacks is severe. In DDOS attacks, flooding of the particular node as victim and jam it with massive traffic happens and the complete network performance is affected. In this paper, a novel Intrusion Detection and Prevention System is designed which detects the flooding DDOS attacks based on Firecol and prevents the attacks based on Dynamic Growing Self Organizing Tree (DGSOT) for collaborative networks. Simulation results show that DGSOT with Firecol (DGSOTFC) produces better intrusion detection and prevention system. Performance metrics based on the parameters delay and energy conservation are better in DGSOT-FC than the traditional IDPS systems.","","978-1-4799-3447-8","","10.1109/ICoAC.2013.6921946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921946","Collaborative Networks;DDOS;DGSOTFC;Flooding;IDPS;Network Security","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Heuristic algorithms;IP networks;Image edge detection;Principal component analysis;Security","computer network security;trees (mathematics)","DDOS attacks;DGSOTFC;Firecol;IDPS design;collaborative protection networks;delay parameter;distributed denial of service attacks;dynamic growing self organizing tree;energy conservation;intrusion detection and prevention system;performance metrics","","0","","10","","","18-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attacks range from sending millions of requests to a server in an attempt to slow it down, flooding a server with large packets of invalid data, to sending requests with an invalid or spoofed IP address. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications. Sequential Pattern Mining is to discover the frequent sequential pattern in the sequential event dataset. Intrusion detection using sequential pattern mining is a research focusing on the field of information security. In this paper, we have implemented Apriori a candidate generation algorithm and PrefixSpan a pattern growth algorithm on a network intrusion dataset from KDD Cup 1999, 10 percent of training dataset, which is the annual Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery competition organized by ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the leading professional organization of data miners. To address the absence of timestamp in the dataset, we considered two approaches to generate the sequence database from the dataset. One is by taking service as reference attribute and the other one by taking a timestamp window of size one day (86400 seconds). We found that experimental results of PrefixSpan for predicting DoS attacks sequences on KDD cup 99 training dataset are efficient. These results are then compared with SPAM (Sequential Pattern Mining) algorithm which uses vertical bitmap data layout allowing for simple, efficient counting.","","978-1-4577-2077-2","","10.1109/ICCICT.2012.6398148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6398148","Data mining;DoS attacks;fuzzy sets;intrusion detection system;sequence data;time interval","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Data mining;Databases;Prediction algorithms;Unsolicited electronic mail","computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory","ACM Special Interest Group;Apriori algorithm;DoS attack sequence prediction;KDD cup 99 training dataset;PrefixSpan algorithm;SPAM algorithm;candidate generation algorithm;data mining;denial of service attack;flooding;frequent sequential pattern discovery;information security;knowledge discovery;network intrusion dataset;networking structure;pattern growth algorithm;professional organization;sequence database generation;sequential pattern mining;spoofed IP address;timestamp window;training dataset;vertical bitmap data layout","","1","","8","","","19-20 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","36","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Typically, centralized approaches to IP traffic analysis have scalability problems, which are addressed by replacing existing hardware with more powerful CPUs and faster memory. In contrast, this paper developed and implemented SCRIPT (Scalable Real-time IP Flow Record Analysis), which defines a scalable analysis framework that can be used to distribute flow records to multiple nodes performing traffic analysis in order to balance the overall workload among those nodes.

A WSN is a versatile smart sensing system to support pervasive monitoring in a variety of applications. In this context available middleware platforms usually provide the Application Layer with different basic services, as shared memory or addressing repository, but do not usually provide security services such as secure links management protocol or intrusion detection. Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN. The security-related components of the proposed middleware include a light yet powerful cryptographic scheme (TAKS) and an Intrusion Detection System (WIDS): the former module exploits the topological properties of a WSN, while the latter one is based on a Weak Process Model approach.","","","","10.1109/Mobilware.2013.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775056","cryptographic scheme;intrusion detection system;middleware;security;wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Intrusion detection;Middleware;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cryptographic protocols;middleware;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks;application layer;cryptographic scheme;distributed resource constrained systems;intrusion detection;middleware platforms;pervasive monitoring;resource constraints;secure communications;secure links management protocol;smart sensing system;weak process model approach","","0","","40","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The next generation of AISs is inspired by “Danger Theory” and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach comprises of three steps. First, the functional requirement specified as a set of use cases are mapped to success tree and fault tree. Second, fault tree and success tree are synthesized to obtain minimum cut sets. These cut sets are then used to identify missing or incorrectly documented requirements. Third, we propose a formalized method to find vulnerable failure modes of software systems with the combination of SFMEA and SFTA techniques.

The algorithm produces an ad hoc transformation for each image, adapting the mapping functions to each image's characteristics to produce the maximum enhancement. We analyze the contrast of the image in the boundary and textured regions, and group the information with common characteristics. These groups model the relations within the image, from which we extract the transformation functions. The results are then adaptively mixed, by considering the human vision system characteristics, to boost the details in the image.

To achieve that, standards as well as standard tools are required for successful evidence collection, preservation, analysis and conviction in case of a criminal case. This paper contributes towards addressing issues in digital forensics by presenting an algorithm that can be used in the evidence identification phase of a digital forensic process. Data in Cloud environments exist in the Internet or in networked environments and data is always accessed remotely. There is therefore at least one connection to a host that exists in a Cloud environment. In a case of a computer system that hosts a Cloud service, the number of connections from clients can be very large. In such a scenario it is very hard to identify an attacker from both active and recently disconnected connections to a host. This may require an investigator to probe all individual IP addresses connected to the host which can be time consuming and costly. There is therefore a need for a mechanism that can identify and rank remote hosts that are connected to a victim host and that may be associated with a malicious activity. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses probabilities to identify and rank suspicious remote hosts connected to a victim host. This algorithm helps minimize the effort required of investigators to probe each IP address that is connected to a victim as connected IP addresses will be prio- itized according to their rank.","","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641044","Cloud Computing;Digital Forensic Processes;Digital Forensics;Intrusion Detection","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Digital forensics;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model","cloud computing;digital forensics;probability","Internet;cloud computing;cloud environment;computer security;digital forensic investigation;digital forensic tools;electronic evidence;evidence identification phase;individual IP addresses;malicious activity;probability;remote host ranking;remote host selection;victim host","","0","","16","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider both wellknown KDD99 dataset and our own network dataset. The KDD99 dataset is a benchmark dataset that is used in various researches while our network dataset is an online network data captured in actual network environment. We evaluate our IDS in terms of detection speed, detection rate and false alarm rate. From the experiment, we can detect network attack in real-time (or within 2-3 seconds) after the data arrives at the detection system. The detection rate of our algorithm is approximately over 97.5%.","","978-1-4799-0546-1","","10.1109/ECTICon.2013.6559603","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6559603","Fuzzy genetic algorithm;intrusion detection;network security;real-time detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Probes;Real-time systems;Training","computer crime;computer network security;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;real-time systems","IDS;KDD99 dataset;benchmark dataset;detection rate;detection speed;false alarm rate;fuzzy genetic algorithm;fuzzy rule;machine learning algorithm;network attack data classification;network attack detection;network dataset;network environment;network intrusion detection;online network data;optimization algorithm;real-time intrusion detection","","2","","9","","","15-17 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these approaches are not sufficient for the unique characteristics and novel misbehaviors or abnormal behaviors encountered in WSNs. In this paper we introduce an implicit security authentication scheme technique ,which can authenticate the sensor nodes based on actions they would carry out anyway.

Zigbee network are vulnerable to Sybil attack in which a Sybil node send forges multiple identities to trick the system and conduct harmful attack.

This is due to the incompleteness of the signatures which lacks or has very little information about when, where and how to match these signatures. The signatures enriched with this information significantly brings down the false positives and at the same time enhances the performance of the signature detection module. In this paper we propose a state base signature detection model which leverages on our state aware signatures with sufficiently complete information to match these signatures. The proposed model keeps track of the state of the connection and matches the signatures within appropriate packets. We further classify our signatures that span across multiple packet and across multiple sessions. We also provide the notion of virtual signatures which represents patterns within packets in a distributed form. In this paper we demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed model to detect these virtual patterns, multi-packet and multi-session leveraging on our state aware signatures.","","978-1-4244-4790-9","978-1-4244-4791-6","10.1109/IADCC.2010.5423011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5423011","Multi-Packet;Multi-Session;State Based Model;State Based Signature;component","Change detection algorithms;Computer networks;Computer vision;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protocols;Search engines;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;pattern matching","IDS;IPS;multipacket signature detection;multisession signature detection;pattern matching;state aware signatures;state base model","","0","","23","","","19-20 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Designing of high-speed inter-building connectivity by free space optical link with radio frequency backup","Sharma, A.; Kaler, R.S.","Electron. & Commun. Eng.

The two buildings in medical campus are ~500~m apart. The FSO link normally uses 1550~nm wavelength but has a radio frequency (RF) link operating at 2.4~GHz as the back-up. In this, 99.999~ availability is achieved by combining the optical laser beam with an alternate path RF solution. The laser beam of 1550~nm provides high-bandwidth connectivity in majority of the time, whereas the RF path maintains critical network connectivity during extreme weather events that are detrimental to the FSO link, such as thick fog. Optical wireless links suffer from atmospheric loss mainly because of fog, scintillation and precipitation. The authors investigate here the impact of fog, rain and snow effects and evaluate their performances for the optical propagation through the atmosphere. The wireless back-up link is used only in very dense fog conditions. Hybrid FSO/RF systems have also been examined as a means to provide high-bandwidth point-to-point links in the access network over larger distances.","1751-8628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2011.0569","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400459","","","atmospheric light propagation;biomedical communication;fog;laser applications in medicine;optical links;rain;scintillation;snow;subscriber loops;telecommunication network reliability","FSO link;access network;alternate path RF solution;atmospheric loss;free space optical link;frequency 2.4 GHz;high-speed inter-building connectivity design;hybrid FSO-RF system;medical service;optical laser beam;optical propagation;optical wireless link;precipitation;radiofrequency backup;scintillation;thick fog;wavelength 1550 nm;wireless back-up link","","1","","","","","November 6 2012","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Due to the on-going discovery of runtime software vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, it is critical to be able to gauge the integrity of a Cloud server as it operates. In this paper, we propose scoped invariants as a primitive for analyzing the software system for its integrity properties. We report our experience with the modeling and detection of scoped invariants. The Xen Virtual Machine Manager is used for a case study. Our research detects a set of essential scoped invariants that are critical to the runtime integrity of Xen. One such property, that the addressable memory limit of a guest OS must not include Xen's code and data, is indispensable for Xen's guest isolation mechanism. The violation of this property demonstrates that the attacker only needs to modify a single byte in the Global Descriptor Table to achieve his goal.","","978-1-4244-9405-7","978-0-7695-4302-4","10.1109/CloudCom.2010.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708514","Xen;integrity modeling;invariants detection;tools","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Runtime;Security;Servers;Software;Software measurement","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;virtual machines","Xen virtual machine manager;cloud computing security;cloud server;global descriptor table;runtime integrity;scoped invariant perspective;software vulnerabilities","","2","","28","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
