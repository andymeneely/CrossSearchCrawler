Due to technological advancements, network speed is increasing day by day, so pattern matching algorithm to be used in IDPS should be fast enough so as to match the network speed. Therefore choice of pattern matching algorithm is the critical to the performance of IDS and IPS. Several pattern matching algorithms exist in literature, but which pattern matching algorithm will give best performance for IDPS is not known at hand. So in this work four pattern matching algorithms namely Brute-force, RabinKarp, Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt has been selected for the analysis.

With maximizing a projection index, Projection Pursuit uses Genetic Algorithm to search for the optimal projection direction, projects network connections records from high-dimensional space into 1-dimensional space, and uses the projection values to analyze the data structure and classify the type of intrusion. This intrusion detection classification model not only cuts down the computing complexity in the process of network connection records, but also opens out non-linear structure not like in latent semantics analysis only discovering linear structure, and the results of classification can also be visualized.

However, there is a weak anomaly detection problem among the existing system call based intrusion detection systems: the pattern value range of abnormal system call sequences generated by attacks always overlaps to that by normal behaviors so it is difficult to accurately classify the sequences falling into the overlap area by a unique threshold. Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.","","978-1-4799-2763-0","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743958","Intrusion Detection;Multi-module System;Top-k Prediction;Viterbi Algorithm","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","computer network security;pattern classification","TkVV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;abnormal system call sequences;computer networks;multimodule anomaly detection system;scalable linear algorithm;sequence classification;system call based intrusion detection systems;system protection;top-k future system call prediction;top-k prediction based multimodule;top-k variation","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with the traditional methods, the model designed here, which is totally insensitive to port numbers and contents of payload on application level, overcomes difficulty in operation caused by unreliable port numbers and complexity of payload interpretation. Rather than relatively complex ML algorithms or even in mixture, supervised k-Nearest Neighbor estimator is adopted for the sake of computational efficiency, along with the effective and easy-to-calculate statistical features selected according to the operational background.

In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.","","978-0-7695-3716-0","","10.1109/FCCM.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944","FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance","","5","","19","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work is motivated by our current research on a framework that optimizes a network-based intrusion detection system for a given application. For this purpose, we need a simulator that supports realistic models for topology, antenna, radio propagation, noise, radio, medium access control and energy consumption - factors that can influence the performance of an intrusion detection system, which is intended to be run on the medium access control layer. In the paper, we consider four open-source simulators - Castalia, MiXiM, TOSSIM and WSNet. We compare these simulators and run a set of experiments on MICAz sensor nodes in the indoor and outdoor environment. Based on the data gathered from the real experiments, we calibrate the radio propagation and noise models of Castalia, MiXiM, TOSSIM and WSNet.

Furthermore, there has been little investigation into whether security performance is reliant on network topography. Consequently this paper advocates that for a range of WLAN infrastructure topographies (home, enterprise & open-access) there can be significant diversity in terms of resources, equipment, users and most importantly security, which can in turn influence attack detection performance. In order to demonstrate these detection differences, a novel framework for evaluating network security performance (the Threat-Victim Table) is developed. This framework is applied to a range of WLAN topographies using an open source (Kismet) Wireless Intrusion Detection System. Three Kismet components are utilised; client, server and drone, to represent typical IDS deployment configurations for these topographies. Analysis of the security capability of Kismet is derived as an example of this framework, for qualifying network security performance against security threats and also to assess the priority level of these vulnerabilities.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741636","802.11;Intrusion Detection Systems;Kismet;Network Security;WLAN","Computer crime;Encryption;Servers;Software;Surfaces;Wireless LAN","","","","0","","13","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps. Other results for a set of 3471 patterns (104399 Byte) with lengths within 21 and 40 characters show an efficiency of 1.87 Byte/Char or 0.42 (6-input LUT/char) and the maximum throughput of 1.97 Gbps.

Metaheuristic optimization algorithms have the potential to achieve global optimal solution. In this paper, two metaheuristic algorithms, Cuckoo and PSOGSA, are examined to optimize the interconnection weights of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This optimized MLP is evaluated with two different flow-based data sets. We then compare the performance of these algorithms.

How-ever, the problem in mobile ad-hoc environment is that communication and power resources are very limited. Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible. This paper presents a comparison study between the co-operative detection model and the aggregative detection model to evaluate the efficiency of resource usage.

In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost.

Here, we focus on intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) to defend against the intruders. In this paper, we propose a Distributed, Collaborative, and Data-driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (DCDIDP). Its goal is to make use of the resources in the cloud and provide a holistic IDPS for all cloud service providers which collaborate with other peers in a distributed manner at different architectural levels to respond to attacks. We present the DCDIDP framework, whose infrastructure level is composed of three logical layers: network, host, and global as well as platform and software levels.

These problems lead to defense systems requiring various detection methods in order to identify attacks. Moreover, DDoS attacks can mix their traffics during flash crowds. By doing this, the complex defense system cannot detect the attack traffic in time. In this paper, we propose a behavior based detection that can discriminate DDoS attack traffic from traffic generated by real users. By using Pearson's correlation coefficient, our comparable detection methods can extract the repeatable features of the packet arrivals.

In addition, it relies on computer and network to maintain it operation. Due to the characteristics of network, person with intention to commit crime can conduct criminal behavior by linking with the network at any time and at any place. If there is no appropriate control on the information asset, information can be easily altered or deleted and even important information may be disclosed thereby generating serious loss. As the business of the finance industry includes the personal and transaction information of customer, therefore the requirement on information security has to be more stringent than other industry. Moreover, for the consideration on information security, generally this is conducted based on the angle of technology, but other factors are ignored. In fact, information security has three aspects including technology, management and policy. This thesis will provide suggestion on the overall information security protection on the information environment of the finance industry.

These causes an authorized services deny from user. Thus poses a major security threat in network. The mitigation of denial of service become hard when it comes to distributed environment. Denial of service can be of any form either ping of death or clone attack. In existing system these can be overcome using filtering technique namely blackhole and sinkhole. Filtering malicious traffic can be integrated with firewall hardware or software. Firecol act as an intrusion prevention system which prevent the network attack using IPS rules. This form a virtual mitigation shield around the network by clusters of IPS system. The above mentioned attack can be detected using honeypot, an IDS(intrusion detection system). So we propose an approach called “IHoneycol” which effectively mitigates distributed denial of service in an efficient manner.","","978-1-4673-5786-9","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508281","DDoS;Honey pot;IPS rule;Ping of death;clone attack","Cloning;Collaboration;Computer crime;Filtering;IP networks;Servers","authorisation;filtering theory;firewalls;pattern clustering","DDoS attack mitigation;Firecol;IDS;IHoneycol;IPS rules;IPS system clusters;authorized services;blackhole;denial of service;distributed collaborative approach;distributed environment;filtering technique;firewall hardware;firewall software;honeypot;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;malicious node;malicious traffic filtering;network attack;security threat;sinkhole;virtual mitigation shield","","0","","10","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attacker usually upgrades itself to root privilege in vicious way using declared or covert holes on the compromised system. In this paper, we proposed a method to detect and resist vicious privilege upgrade based on integrity checking of trusted computing. At first, we calculated the secure hash values of the special executable code which upgrade privilege in legal way at relative safe status, and stored them in trusted platform model (TPM). Secondly, we embedded the anti-attack module in the scheduler of OS and kept pace with the scheduler. Once having detected privilege upgrade, we checked the integrity of current executable code with the pre-calculated secure hash values stored in TPM. Comparison mismatch explicated that object system was under attack. Object system terminated the current executable code immediately to resist vicious privilege upgrade. We realized this method based on Linux system and suggested an enhanced Linux kernel (ELK). Experiment result showed that this method can tolerate the existence of holes to a certain degree and safeguard system security from vicious privilege upgrade with acceptable cost.","","978-1-4244-5272-9","","10.1109/CNMT.2009.5374771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374771","","Computer bugs;Computer science;Kernel;Law;Legal factors;Linux;Operating systems;Processor scheduling;Resists;Security","Linux;security of data","OS scheduler;antiattack module;enhanced Linux kernel;integrity checking;object system;operating system;system security;trusted computing;trusted platform model;vicious privilege upgrade detection method","","0","","10","","","18-20 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main security concern for e-business is Web application security. Web applications have many vulnerabilities such as Injection, Broken Authentication and Session Management, and Cross-site scripting (XSS). Subsequently, web applications have become targets of hackers, and a lot of cyber attack began to emerge in order to block the services of these Web applications (Denial of Service Attach). Developers are not aware of these vulnerabilities and have no enough time to secure their applications. Therefore, there is a significant need to study and improve attack detection for web applications through determining the most significant factors for detection. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any research that summarizes the influent factors of detection web attacks. In this paper, the author studies state-of-the-art techniques and research related to web attack detection: the author analyses and compares different methods of web attack detections and summarizes the most important factors for Web attack detection independent of the type of vulnerabilities.

Using our architecture we conduct a series of tests. We indicate that our UDAs can elevate millisecond-scale running time of current proposals to nanosecond-scale (including proposals from northbound applications of SDN community and virtual appliances of Network Function Virtualization or NFV community). Also, regarding ease of programmability, we show that our proposal decrease the lines of code of by 72.9% and 79.3% compared to implementing the same functionality as a northbound application and as a standalone middlebox, respectively.

We propose an alternative hybrid-NIDS that couples an FPGA with a network adapter to provide hardware support for pattern matching and software support for post processing. The proposed system, SFAOENIDS, offers an extensible open-source NIDS for Solarflare AOE devices. The pattern matching engine-the primary component of the hardware architecture was designed based on the requirements of typical NIDS implementations. In testing on a real network environment, the SFAOENIDS hardware implementation, operating at 200 MHz, handles a 10Gbps data rate without dropping packets while simultaneously minimizing the server CPU load.","","","","10.1109/ASAP.2014.6868655","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868655","","Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Pattern matching;Software","field programmable gate arrays;security of data","SFAOENIDS;SNORT;Solarflare AOE devices;inline FPGA;lower network bandwidth;network adapters;network load;open-source NIDS;pattern matching;pattern matching engine;practical network intrusion detection system;real network environment;security threats;software based NIDS implementations","","0","","8","","","18-20 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two ways to model the system call sequences, one as full sequences and the other as lookahead pairs. Recently it has been shown that lookahead pairs perform better than full sequences. In this paper we propose an impurity tolerant model of anomaly detection using system calls called as Pairgram. Pairgram exploits the frequency information of lookahed pairs and build a model of normal behavior. As it is generally assumed that there is a skewed distribution of normal and abnormal sequences, more frequently occurring system call sequences are considered as normal and other way for less frequent sequences. A series of experiments on the University of New Mexico system call dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of Pairgram on impure dataset. Further the model is highly space efficient i.e., it has a constant space complexity of square of alphabet size of the program sequence.","","978-1-4673-0296-8","978-1-4673-0297-5","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151337","Impurity tolerant models;Intrusion detection system;Lookahead pairs;Program based anomaly detection","Approximation algorithms;Complexity theory;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","application program interfaces;computational complexity;security of data;software fault tolerance","Pairgram;abnormal sequence skewed distribution;constant space complexity;impurity tolerant model;lookahead pair frequency information modeling;normal sequence skewed distribution;program sequence;system call dataset;system call sequence based anomaly detection","","0","","42","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this evolution has also contributed to the rise of the identity theft. An alternative to curb identity theft is by the identification of anomalous user behavior on the computer, what is known as behavioral intrusion detection. Among the features to be extracted from the user behavior, this paper focuses on keystroke dynamics, which analysis the user typing rhythm. This work uses a neural network to recognize users by keystroke dynamics and draws a comparison among several training algorithms: single backpropagation, three approaches based on genetic algorithms and three approaches based on immune algorithms.","","978-1-4673-1510-4","978-1-4673-1508-1","10.1109/CEC.2012.6252928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252928","","Backpropagation;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Neural networks;Training","authorisation;backpropagation;behavioural sciences;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;neural nets;user interfaces","anomalous user behavior identification;behavioral intrusion detection;digital identities;evolutionary neural networks;feature extraction;genetic algorithm;identity theft;immune algorithm;keystroke dynamic recognition;single backpropagation;training algorithm;user typing rhythm","","2","","32","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization is a technology that eliminates the “uniqueness” dependency by creating an abstraction layer between the hardware and the software that runs on it. The aim of virtualization is to centralize the information system for facilitating administrative task while improving scalability. Virtualization technology which allows more efficient use of existing physical hardware, as well as some advantages including cost reduction, labor loss and performance improvement, contains several innovations in security, especially in system security. Software applications such as antivirus, firewall, end point security installed on the servers to ensure system security causes performance loss on the network and servers. Hence, security applications must be implemented on virtualization layer (hypervisor, Virtual Machine Monitor) to cover all the virtual system. In this paper, we aim to explain usage of Intrusion Detection Systems and Intrusion Prevention Systems in virtualization technologies and prologue possible security threats in virtual area.","","978-1-4673-6419-5","","10.1109/ICAICT.2013.6722757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722757","Cyber Security;Intrusion Detection Systems;Intrusion Prevention Systems;System Security;Virtualization Virtual Machine","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Software;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","abstraction layer;cost reduction;hypervisor;information system;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention systems;labor loss;performance improvement;security threats;software applications;system security;virtual machine monitor;virtualization technologies","","0","","11","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","","978-0-7695-4056-6","978-1-4244-7143-0","10.1109/FCCM.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050","FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching","Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching","FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree","","2","","17","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Switching across processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints. We develop index-type algorithms for the case with both known observation distributions and the case when the observation distributions have unknown parameters. We show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing the total expected cost as the error constraints approach zero.

Although numerous intrusion detection systems are available, yet it is not practical to install IDS in every virtual machine. In this paper, we argue that a virtual machine monitor (VMM) can support certain security functions that our proposed design can actively collect information directly from the VMM without installing an agent in the guest OS. In addition, bot could not aware of the existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and active detection approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the active detection agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates. Also, the result shows the active detection agent can detect a bot even when before it performs its malicious jobs. The proposed mechanism suites an enterprise having cloud environment well to defeat malware.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682703","bot;fingerprinting;hypervisor;intrusion detection","Conferences;Detectors;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","IDS;VMM;active bot fingerprinting;active detection approaches;bot behavior profiles;cloud security;cooperative botnet detection;cooperative botnet profiling;enterprise;guest OS;malicious jobs;malware;passive detection approaches;virtual machine monitor;virtualized environment","","0","","22","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This division is based according to their computational power and level of vulnerability. These pools are provided with different levels of security measures within the network. IDS use different number of Honey Tokens (HT) per frame for every different pool. Moreover every pool uses different types of encryption schemes (AES-128,192,256) etc. We use critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes for our simulations. We analyzed the performance of IDS in terms of True Positive and False Negative Alarms. Finally we test this IDS through Network Penetration Testing (NPT). This NPT is accomplished by putting the critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes directly under the zero day cyber-attacks and then we analyze the behavior of the IDS under such realistic conditions. The IDS is designed in such a way that it not only detects the intrusions but also recovers the entire zero day attack using reverse engineering approach.","","","","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974088","Critical Infrastructure Networks;Cyber Security;Cyber Space;Cyber Threats;Cyber Warfare;DNP3;Distributed Sensor Networks;Encrypted Pointers;Honey Token;Industrial Communication Protocol;Industrial Networks;Information Infrastructure;Information Security;Intelligence Infrastructure;Intrusion Detection System;SCADA Command and Control System;Zero Day Attacks","Databases;Encryption;Generators;Intrusion detection;Protocols","computer network security;critical infrastructures;cryptography;reverse engineering","IDS;NPT;critical infrastructure networks;cyber-attacks;encryption schemes;false negative alarms;honey token based encrypted pointers;intrusion detection system;network penetration testing;reverse engineering approach;true positive alarms;zero day cyber threats","","0","1","20","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a fuzzy rule based classification system is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. Thus the optimization power of Genetic Algorithm has been applied to select a small number of significant fuzzy rules for a compact classification system applied to multivariate dataset classification. The hybrid algorithm is used here to predict cellular localization sites of proteins in yeast. Two different fitness measures were taken to evaluate the rules generated by the algorithm during evolution process. Than the performance of Fuzzy Genetic algorithm with better fitness measure is compared to the performance of Naïve Bayesian approach to accurately detect and classify patterns. The performance analysis includes testing on train as well as test dataset, created from original dataset. It is found that the fuzzy genetic algorithm with the fitness measure based on data mining support-confidence framework performs better compared to other fitness measure but in terms of classification Naïve Bayesian technique is much more reliable.","","","","10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073108","Classification;Fuzzy;Genetic Algorithm;Machine learning;Naïve Bayes","Accuracy;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Niobium;Pragmatics;Sociology;Training","Bayes methods;biology computing;combinatorial mathematics;data mining;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;generalisation (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;proteins","Naïve Bayesian approach;cellular localization sites;combinatorial optimization problem;data mining support-confidence framework;evolution process;evolutionary fuzzy genetic algorithm;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule based classification system;generalization capability;machine learning problems;multivariate dataset classification;pattern classification;pattern detection;performance analysis;proteins;soft-computing techniques;statistical techniques;yeast","","0","","15","","","22-23 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on ""traditional"" graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781","","Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic","","1","","21","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The human labeling of the available network audit data instances is usually tedious, time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called k-means clustering via naïve bayes classification for anomaly based network intrusion detection. Experimental results on the KDD cup'99 data set show the novelty of our approach in detecting network intrusion.

Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2008.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182","Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity","","Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data","Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability","","12","","27","","2008-02-02","Jan.-March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711","978-1-4577-2027-7","978-1-4577-2026-0","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","1","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Payload-based approaches are effective to known DOS attacks but are unable to be deployed on high-speed networks. To address this issue, flow-based DOS detection schemes have been proposed for highspeed networks as an effective supplement of payload-based solutions. However, existing flow-based solutions have serious limitations in detecting unknown attacks and efficiently identifying real attack flows buried in the background traffic. In addition, existing solutions also have difficulty to adapt to attack dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a flow-based DOS detection scheme based on Artificial Immune systems. We adopt a tree structure to store flow information such that we can effectively extract useful features from flow information for better detecting DoS attacks. We employ Neighborhood Negative Selection (NNS) as the detection algorithm to detect unknown DoS attacks, and identify attack flows from massive traffic. Because the strong tolerance of NNS, the proposed solution is able to quickly adapt attack dynamics. The experimental results show that this solution is able to effectively detect unknown DoS attack flows and identify attack flows from background traffic. Meanwhile, the theoretical analysis demonstrates that this system can extract flow features more effectively.","","978-1-4673-1855-6","","10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664254","Artificial immune;DoS attack;Flow;Intrusion detection","Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Data mining;Detectors;Feature extraction;IP networks;Protocols","Internet;artificial immune systems;computer network security;real-time systems;telecommunication traffic","DoS attack flows;DoS attacks;Internet;NNS;artificial immune systems;attack dynamics;background traffic;detection algorithm;flow information;flow-based DOS detection schemes;flow-based solutions;high-speed networks;neighborhood negative selection;payload-based approaches;payload-based solutions;real attack flows;tree structure","","0","","14","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Network Intrusion Detection Systems in High-Speed Traffic in Computer Networks","Bulajoul, W.; James, A.; Pannu, M.","Fac. of Eng. & Comput., Coventry Univ., Coventry, UK","e-Business Engineering (ICEBE), 2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on","20131219","2013","","","168","175","With the various and increasingly malicious attacks on networks and wireless systems, traditional security tools such as anti-virus programs and firewalls are not sufficient to provide free, integrated, reliable and secure networks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most tested and reliable technologies to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks. It is critical to implement network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic and high-speed connectivity. Due to the fact that software NIDSs are still unable to detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks (UDP, TCP, ICMP and HTTP) or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DoS/DDoS), because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or slow down the performance of systems. Here we have designed a suitable real network to present experiments that use Snort NIDSs to demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDSs, such as its inability to process multiple packets at high speeds and its propensity to drop packets without analysing them. This paper outlines Snort NIDSs' failures in high-speed and heavy traffic and its propensity to drop more packets as the speed and volume of traffic increase. We ran some consecutive tests to analyse the Snort performance using the number of packets received, the number of packets analysed, the number of packets filtered and the number of packets dropped. We suggest a parallel NIDS technology to reduce dropping packets as a solution.","","","","10.1109/ICEBE.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686259","IDS;network security;open source","Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DoS/DDoS;HTTP;ICMP;Snort NIDSs;Snort performance analysis;TCP;UDP;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;flood attacks;high-speed traffic;incoming network traffic monitoring;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection systems;outgoing network traffic monitoring;security tools;unauthorized usage identification;wireless systems","","0","","23","","","11-13 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool to protect computer networks from attacks. Traditional packet-based NIDSs are time-intensive as they analyze all network packets. A state-of-the-art NIDS should be able to handle a high volume of traffic in real time. Flow-based intrusion detection is an effective method for high speed networks since it inspects only packet headers. The existence of new attacks in the future is another challenge for intrusion detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection is a well-known method capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose a flow-based anomaly detection system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important approach for anomaly detection. We used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with one hidden layer. We investigate the use of a Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) in optimizing interconnection weights of a MLP network. Our proposed GSA-based flow anomaly detection system (GFADS) is trained with a flow-based data set. The trained system can classify benign and malicious flows with 99.43% accuracy. We compare the performance of GSA with traditional gradient descent training algorithms and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results show that GFADS is effective in flow-based anomaly detection. Finally, we propose a four-feature subset as the optimal set of features.","","978-1-4799-3247-4","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2013.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679866","Flow-based anomaly detection;Gravitational Search algorithm;Multi-layer Perceptron","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","multilayer perceptrons;search problems;security of data","ANN;GFADS;GSA algorithm;GSA-based flow anomaly detection system;MLP network;anomaly-based intrusion detection;artificial neural network;benign flow classification;flow-based anomaly detection;flow-based intrusion detection;gravitational search algorithm;high speed networks;malicious flow classification;multilayer perceptron neural network","","1","","20","","","8-11 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are credible targets of active (e.g., terrorist) attacks since their disruption may lead to sizable losses economically and in human lives. It is thus crucial to develop decision support that can guide administrators in deploying defense resources for system security and reliability. Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights. We also contrast our results with those of static games, and quantify the gain in defender payoff due to misinformation of the attacker.","0885-8950","","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2226480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378414","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Cost function;Game theory;Games;Load modeling;Markov processes;Power transmission lines;Security","Markov processes;game theory;power grids;power system security;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability","Colombia;IEEE standard 14-bus system;Markov game analysis;Stackelberg games;WECC 9-bus system;Yemen;decision support;defense mechanism;defense resources;dynamic states;electricity grids;equilibrium mixed strategies;game model;infrastructure protection;power network attack-defense;static games;system reliability;system security;transmission network continual attack-defense;zero-sum Markov games","","5","","28","","2012-12-11","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the large number of false alarms is a big problem for these detection systems which greatly reduces their effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate this problem, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to help filter out false alarms by adaptively and periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor) that conduct the best single-algorithm performance. Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level. In this paper, we aim to conduct a case study in exploring the performance of our developed false alarm filter by implementing a fuzzy classifier based on if-then rules. By comparing with other algorithms that have been implemented in our false alarm filter, the experimental results show that the if-then rules based fuzzy algorithm performs a bit better than the baseline algorithm and can be improved by selecting an appropriate fuzzy partition.","","978-1-4673-0025-4","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233768","False alarm reduction;Intelligent fuzzy system;Machine learning;Network intrusion detection","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","baseline algorithm;fuzzy algorithm;fuzzy classifier;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy partition;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network security infrastructure;single algorithm performance;stable level","","1","","25","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization and multi-tenancy provide a number of advantages for increasing resource utilization and for providing on demand elasticity. However, these cloud features also raise many security concerns related to cloud computing resources. In this paper, we propose an architecture and approach for leveraging the virtualization technology at the core of cloud computing to perform intrusion detection security using hypervisor performance metrics. Through the use of virtual machine performance metrics gathered from hypervisors, such as packets transmitted/received, block device read/write requests, and CPU utilization, we demonstrate and verify that suspicious activities can be profiled without detailed knowledge of the operating system running within the virtual machines. The proposed hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system does not require additional software installed in virtual machines and has many advantages compared to host-based and network based intrusion detection systems which can complement these traditional approaches to intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785472","Cloud Computing;hypervisor;intrusion detection","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer network security;software architecture;software metrics;virtual machines;virtualisation","CPU utilization;block device read requests;block device write requests;cloud computing resources;cloud features;hypervisor performance metrics;hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system;intrusion detection security;multitenancy;operating system;packet transmission;received packets;shared resource utilization;virtual machine performance metrics;virtualization;virtualization technology","","1","","16","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While such implementations, capable of handling lower protocol layers, have been extensively studied in research and industry, their extension to higher communication layers has only rarely been addressed. Such capabilities, including the application level (OSI Layer 7), are the focus of this work. We present the NetStage platform, employing reconfigurable computing for high-throughput low-latency network processing, as well as associated development tools that allow networking domain experts to easily customize the system. As a use-case, we consider the realization of high-performance attack-resilient honeypots based on NetStage.
