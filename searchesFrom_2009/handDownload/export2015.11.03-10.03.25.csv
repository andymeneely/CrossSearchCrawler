"We are all treated equal, aren't we? — Flow-level performance as a function of flow size","Mehmood, M.A.; Feldmann, A.; Uhlig, S.; Willinger, W.","KICS, UET, Lahore, Pakistan","Networking Conference, 2014 IFIP","20140717","2014","","","1","9","Recent Internet studies have reported on continued traffic growth, changes in applications usage, and a proliferation in the adoption of high-speed access links. Any adverse impact that these observed trends may have on Internet traffic flows can result in sub par performance, which in turn results in unsatisfactory user experience. To study such adverse impacts, we examine in this paper the flow-level performance of popular applications across a range of size-based flow-classes and applications. We use out-of-sequence packets, retransmissions, throughput, and RTTs as key flow performance metrics. Leveraging data sets collected from two complementary network environments, we compare these metrics for popular applications and for the up/downstream directions. We show that irrespective of the direction, flows are severely impacted by the specifics of the network, e.g., DSL or CDN and application behavior. We also find that, in general, this impact differs markedly across the different flow-classes. In particular, contrary to popular belief, the small flows from all applications, which make up the majority of flows, experience significant retransmissions, while the very large flows, although small in number, experience very limited retransmissions. In terms of application-related performance, we observe that especially when compared to HTTP, apart from large flows, P2P flows suffer from continuously high retransmissions and low throughput. As for the root cause of these retransmissions, we identify the access part of the network as the main culprit and not the network core.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2014.6857100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857100","","DSL;Internet;Measurement;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Throughput","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","CDN;DSL;Internet traffic flows;P2P flows;RTT;application behavior;application-related performance;flow-level performance;high-speed access links;key flow performance metrics;out-of-sequence packets;retransmissions;size-based flow-classes;throughput","","0","","45","","","2-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection. Experimental results show that, even traditional methods fail in some situations, our simple method works well in all cases.","","978-1-4673-1889-1","","10.1109/NAS.2012.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310873","anomaly detection;data mining;grammar-based compression","Compression algorithms;Entropy;Grammar;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Statistical analysis;Training","Markov processes;information theory;security of data;telecommunication security","Markovian method;Markovian model;anomaly detection algorithm;anomaly detection method;bug detection;compression algorithm;data structure;grammar compression;information quantity;information theoretic anomaly detection framework;information theoretic measures;information theory;intrusion detection;lossless compression;network security","","0","","26","","","28-30 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large number of messages are exchanged for key establishment at startup and every time a node join or leave the group to refresh keys. These operations incur huge computation and communication cost that reduces the network life time. To minimize energy consumption and improve network lifetime, this paper presents a lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme (XKFS), which allows refreshing the key without inter node message transmission. A single message containing a magic word is transmitted by the group head to its member nodes and keys are refreshed using XOR and left shift operations. XKFS only requires a light weight message from a more powerful head node and thus eliminates the inter node communication cost. The performance of the XKFS is validated through simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the performance supremacy of XKFS over contemporary schemes in terms of minimizing key freshness operations and energy consumption.","","978-1-4799-8827-3","","10.1109/ITNG.2015.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113467","Energy efficiency;Key freshness;Key management;Secure group communication;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;electronic messaging;private key cryptography;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","XKFS;energy consumption minimization;huge communication cost;huge computation cost;left shift operations;lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme;magic word;message exchange;message transmission;resource constrained WSN;secret key establishment;wireless sensor network life time","","0","","17","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trust is platform-independent and flexible to be seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous domains and interoperate with different security solutions in distributed environments. Establishing trust in a service workflow leads to the willingness of services to participate. Coordinating service workflows without trust consideration may pose higher risks, possibly results in poor performance, additional vulnerabilities, or failures. Although trust in service workflows and relevant contexts has been studied for a past decade, the standard development is still immature. Nowadays, trust approaches to service workflows comprise a large area of research where one can hardly classify into a comprehensive survey.

However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064","","Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security","estimation theory;telecommunication security","detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Cross Layer Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection System","Satam, Pratik","","Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems Workshops (SASOW), 2015 IEEE International Conference on","20151029","2015","","","157","161","Since the start of the 21st century, computer networks have been through an exponential growth in terms of the network capacity, the number of the users and the type of tasks that are performed over the network. With the resent boom of mobile devices (e.g., Tablet computers, smart phones, smart devices, and wearable computing), the number of network users is bound to increase exponentially. But, most of the communications protocols, that span over the 7 layers of the OSI model, were designed in the late 1980's or 90's. Although most of these protocols have had subsequent updates over time, most of these protocols still remain largely unsecure and open to attacks. Hence it is critically important to secure these protocols across the 7 layers of the OSI model. As a part of my PhD research, I am working on a cross layer anomaly behavior detection system for various protocols. This system will be comprised of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for each of the protocols that are present in each layer. The behavior analysis of each protocol will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase (training), the features that accurately characterize the normal operations of the protocol are identified using data mining and statistical techniques and then use them to build a runtime model of protocol normal operations. In addition, some known attacks against the studied protocol are also studied to develop a partial attack model for the protocol. The anomaly behavior analysis modules of each layer are then fused to generate a highly accurate detection system with low false alarms.

This paper proposes a formal methodology for fingerprinting experiments using which we can model a broad spectrum of fingerprinting problems and design-efficient algorithms. We present a formal behavioral model that specifies a protocol principal by its states and transitions, then identify a complete taxonomy of fingerprint matching and discovery problems is identified based on 1) whether the fingerprinting experiment is active or passive and 2) the information available about the specifications and implementations. Algorithms to solve the problems are discussed. In particular, for fingerprint matching algorithm, we propose an efficient PEFSM online separation algorithm for active experiment and concurrent passive testing for passive experiments. For fingerprint discovery problem, there are two cases: if the protocol specification is available as a nondeterministic PEFSM, we apply across verification and back-tracing technique for active and passive discovery, respectively; if no specification is available, we take the machine learning approach and discover the fingerprint by active testing.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5686874","Formal methods;network level security and protection;network management;protocol verification.","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Data models;Fingerprint recognition;Protocols;Taxonomy;Testing","computer network security;protocols;telecommunication network management","PEFSM online separation algorithm;back-tracing technique;fingerprint discovery problem;fingerprint matching algorithm;formal methodology;machine learning approach;network protocol fingerprinting;network security","","1","","34","","2011-01-13","Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, because of the ubiquitous and pervasive computing paradigm that the WSNs foster and because of the resource constrained characteristic, security & privacy issues therein assume critical investigation. Amongst many potential aspects of investigation, one has been the design of a secure routing protocol in which a value sensed to be delivered to an appropriate receiver securely and efficiently with least amount of energy consumption. We observe that LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a popular clustering based protocol used in WSNs. However, the same lacks any security support. Amongst numerous improvements of LEACH suggested to incorporate security & privacy, we observe that none, to the best of our knowledge offers end-to-end privacy using the homomorphic encryption schemes. We propose here an improvement of LEACH viz. E-LEACH (end-to-end secure LEACH) which uses homomorphic encryption to provide secure data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks. Due to the algebraic characteristics in homomorphic encryption, data can be algebraically aggregated without decryption and hence require least amount of energy, while ensuring privacy.","","978-1-4799-6499-4","","10.1109/ICIINFS.2014.7036607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036607","Clustering;Homomorphic Encryption;LEACH;Secure Data Aggregation","Base stations;Encryption;Routing protocols;Steady-state;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;energy consumption;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","E-LEACH;WSN;clustering based protocol;end-to-end privacy;end-to-end secure LEACH;energy consumption;homomorphic encryption schemes;low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;pervasive computing paradigm;receiver securely;resource constrained characteristic;secure data aggregation;secure routing protocol;ubiquitous computing paradigm;wireless sensor networks","","0","","16","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, useful autonomous approach should be applied to fuse data automatically and accurately. In this paper, a decision fusion approach based on clustering technique is proposed.

In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic.","","978-1-4673-6214-6","","10.1109/ISI.2013.6578795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578795","Access Logs;Anomaly Detection;Data Mining;Electronic Health Records;Healthcare Security;Insider threats","Context;Hospitals;Information systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Sociology;Statistics","data mining;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;random processes;security of data","LDA;ROA model;RTA;RTAD;anomalous topic access detection;anomalous topic access modeling;anomalous user detection;anomaly detection framework;attacker characteristics;feature extraction;healthcare;hospital audit logs;information systems;insider threat detection;k-NN algorithm;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;latent Dirichlet allocation;machine learning;model formalization;outlier detection;random object access model;random record access;random topic access detection;random topic access model;random users;statistics;strategy development;topic summarization;user roles;workflow knowledge","","0","","13","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. As part of an overall strategy for network resilience, a crucial requirement is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a novel solution that enables the progressive multi-stage deployment of resilience strategies, based on incomplete challenge and context information. Policies are used to orchestrate the interactions between various resilience mechanisms, which incrementally identify the nature of a challenge and deploy appropriate remediation mechanisms. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach via simulation of a resource starvation attack on an Internet Service Provider infrastructure. By initially using lightweight detection and then progressively applying more heavyweight analysis, a key contribution of our work is the ability to mitigate a challenge as early as possible and rapidly detect its root cause.

As an example, the integration between telecommunication and physical processes, that happens when the power grid is managed and controlled, yields to epistemic uncertainty. Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied. The paper demonstrates how the use of the Reduced Power Set yields to more efficient algorithms for combining evidences and to application of Evidence Theory for assessing risk.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266730","","Electronic mail;Internet;Power grids;Risk management;Security;Uncertainty","Internet;fuzzy set theory;graph theory;knowledge based systems;risk management;security of data","Internet;cyber-physical layers;epistemic uncertainty management;fuzzy theory;graph representation;graph-based evidence theory;heterogeneous sources;power grid;reduced power set;risk assessment;risk evaluation;rule-based systems","","","","","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach to addressing this challenge would be to profile hosts that engage in scanning activity and predict their future actions. However, this requires understanding how hosts evolve their scanning behaviour. In order to address this issue we have analysed logs from the DShield repository of globally distributed IDS alerts corresponding to the first 15 days of January 2005. We first clustered hosts using similarities in the spatial breadth (targeted DShield subscribers) and depth (targeted destination ports) of their scanning activity during aggregation intervals of one day at a time. We then analysed temporal properties like popularity, volatility, lifetime and transition of these clusters to infer how they evolved over time. We found persistent clusters with stable sizes. However, they were highly volatile with a consistent turn-over of hosts everyday. This was caused by the lifetime of hosts in each cluster mostly being one day. Nevertheless, we came across a non-trivial number of hosts that appeared everyday while belonging to the same cluster or transitioning from one cluster to another. Based on these findings, it is plausible that suspicious hosts can be profiled for long periods of time to predict an imminent multistage attack.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319276","","Aggregates;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Internet;Intrusion detection;Recruitment;Size measurement;Software engineering;Spatiotemporal phenomena","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","DShield repository;Internet;aggregation interval;distributed IDS;evolution characterisation;imminent multistage attack detection;stable size;suspicious host scanning activity;temporal property","","0","3","13","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","1533-2306","978-1-4577-1118-3","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","13","","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important component of the CPS devices is the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless, current security models consider protecting only networking components of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS devices. In this work, we focus on these novel sensory channel threats to CPS devices and applications. We first note how sensory channel threats are an emerging area for the CPS world. Then, we analyze the performance various sensory channel threats. Moreover, using an iRobot Create as our CPS platform, we exploit simple vulnerable programs on iRobot through its infrared channel. Finally, we introduce the design of a novel sensory channel aware intrusion detection system as a protection mechanism against the sensory channel threats for CPS devices.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997498","CPS Security;Cyber-Physical Systems;Sensory Attacks;Sensory-channel threats","Accelerometers;Malware;Robot sensing systems;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","invasive software","CPS;cyber physical systems;iRobot Create;intrusion detection system;malware;novel computing paradigm;security models;sensory channel threats;sensory channels","","0","","39","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, extending the functionality and the lifetime of products requires the addition of new functionality to track and satisfy the customers needs and market and technology trends. Many contemporary products along with the software part incorporate hardware accelerators for reasons of performance and power efficiency. While adaptivity of software is straightforward, adaptation of the hardware to changing requirements constitutes a challenging problem requiring delicate solutions.

It identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware. The proposed architecture is able to efficiently handle large volumes of collected data and consequent high processing loads using Hadoop, MapReduce and cloud computing infrastructure. The main focus of the paper is to enhance the throughput and scalability of the IDS Log analysis. Once enough data is gathered, it is necessary to rapidly analyze it and determine whether any attacks or malicious activities are present, which is the main issue that impacts IDS performance.","","978-1-4799-1594-1","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724158","Cloud Computing;Hadoop File System;Intrusion Detection System;MapReduce","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Computers;File systems;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;security of data","Hadoop;IDS;IDS monitors network traffic;cloud computing infrastructure;computer systems;data analytics;data processing;distributed computing system;distributed file system;malicious activities;malicious attacks;network administrator;network environment security;network security;open-source computing platform;scalable intrusion detection systems log analysis;storage services;suspicious activity","","1","","11","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SFTA has been derived and applied in software from a similar hardware safety analysis technique named Fault Tree Analysis (FTA).

"Proposed Intrusion Detection on ZRP based MANET by effective k-means clustering method of data mining","Sumit, S.; Mitra, D.; Gupta, D.","Dept. of CSE/IT, Manipal Univ. Jaipur, Jaipur, India","Optimization, Reliabilty, and Information Technology (ICROIT), 2014 International Conference on","20140417","2014","","","156","160","Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) consist of peer-to-peer infrastructure less communicating nodes that are highly dynamic. As a result, routing data becomes more challenging. Ultimately routing protocols for such networks face the challenges of random topology change, nature of the link (symmetric or asymmetric) and power requirement during data transmission. Under such circumstances both, proactive as well as reactive routing are usually inefficient. We consider, zone routing protocol (ZRP) that adds the qualities of the proactive (IARP) and reactive (IERP) protocols. In ZRP, an updated topological map of zone centered on each node, is maintained. Immediate routes are available inside each zone. In order to communicate outside a zone, a route discovery mechanism is employed. The local routing information of the zones helps in this route discovery procedure. In MANET security is always an issue. It is possible that a node can turn malicious and hamper the normal flow of packets in the MANET. In order to overcome such issue we have used a clustering technique to separate the nodes having intrusive behavior from normal behavior. We call this technique as effective k-means clustering which has been motivated from k-means. We propose to implement Intrusion Detection System on each node of the MANET which is using ZRP for packet flow. Then we will use effective k-means to separate the malicious nodes from the network.

There is one core in common between all dynamic web application and that is their need to use a database to store information inside that and retrieve that information upon the user request or add, edit and delete them. Among all database types, rational databases are very popular. Most of relational database management systems such as MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, MS Access, Postgres use SQL as their language. Flexibility of SQL makes it a powerful language. It allows the user to ask what information he wants without having any knowledge about how the information will be fetch. However vast use of SQL based databases make it the center of attention of hackers. SQL injection attack is a well-known security threat to database driven web applications. A successful SQL injection attack reveals critical confidential information to the hacker. In this paper first we provided background information on this vulnerability. Next we present a comprehensive review of different types of SQL injection attack. For each attack we provide an example that shows how the attack launches. Finally we propose the best solution at development phase to defeat SQL injection and conclusion.","","","","10.1109/ICICM.2013.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702822","Information Security;SQL Injection;SQLIA;Web Application Vulnerability","Delays;Encoding;Programming;Relational databases;Security;Servers","Internet;SQL;computer crime;information retrieval systems;relational databases","Internet connection;MS Access;MS SQL Server;MySQL;Oracle;Postgres;SQL based databases;SQL injection attack taxonomy;banking;database driven Web applications;dynamic Web application;email;hackers;information retrieval;information storage;online business;online services;rational databases;relational database management systems;security threat;shopping;social networks","","1","","10","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In DPI the packet payload is compared against a set of predefined patterns which can be specified using regular expressions (regexes). It is well-known that mapping regexes to deterministic finite automata (DFA) will suffer from the state explosion problem. Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided. Further, it achieves a fully automated signature compilation with polynomial running time and space.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501976","","Automata;Communications Society;Counting circuits;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;History;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Polynomials","","","","1","1","14","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.

To generalize the problem, the game data are assumed not to be fully known to the players, who take a robust optimization approach to address this data uncertainty. For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated. Equilibrium analysis reveals how the conflicting objectives of the intruder and intrusion detection system compel them to adopt different conservative stances toward data uncertainty. It is also shown, by numerical results, that the robust approach in the presence of uncertainty reduces the sensitivity of the solution with respect to data perturbations, and thus improves design stability.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2332816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6842601","Dynamic programming;NET-ATTP-INT;NET-MONT;SECOTHS;games;optimization;robustness;security;stochastic processes;uncertainty;wireless sensor networks","Games;Optimization;Robustness;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty;Wireless sensor networks","optimisation;security of data;stochastic games;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling;wireless sensor networks","WSN;data perturbation;data uncertainty;design stability;equilibrium analysis;game parameter;incomplete information;nonzero-sum discounted stochastic game theory;player objective model;robust optimal intrusion detection problem;robust optimization model;security requirements;wireless sensor networks","","1","","37","","2014-06-24","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the detection phase the algorithm provides implementation of window size to detect intrusions that are temporally located. Also a threshold is implemented that is altered on basis of the process behavior. The system is tested with attacks that target different intrusion scenarios. The result shows that the radial Basis Functions Neural Networks provide better detection rate and very low training time as compared to other soft computing methods.

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","0","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an adaptive firewall system in collaboration with DNS (Domain Name System) which introduces querier's IP address notification feature. With such a feature, the proposal system can identify whether each communication flow can be trusted or not by checking the querier's IP address and the DNS query target domain name. Then based on the result of checking, the firewall system adaptively decides specific operation for specific connection. Consequently, the trusted flows go through bypass route of higher bandwidth without heavy packet inspection while untrusted flows will be blocked or restricted by strict packet inspection. Thus, the firewall system totally accomplishes higher throughput.","","978-1-4577-0531-1","978-0-7695-4423-6","10.1109/SAINT.2011.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004157","DNS;Firewall System;Load Balancing","Collaboration;IP networks;Inspection;Proposals;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;computer network security","DNS query target domain name;IP address notification;Internet services;adaptive firewall system;domain name system;extended DNS;network security;packet inspection","","0","","6","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Antigens are profiles of system calls while corresponding behaviors are regarded as signals. This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are ""embedded"" to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses. Accordingly, computer hosts met with malicious intrusions can be effectively detected via input signals and temporary output signals such as PAMP, danger and safe signals.","1098-7584","978-1-4244-7315-1","978-1-4244-7316-8","10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007564","artificial immune systems;dendritic cell algorithm;intrusion detection;multiagent","Adaptive systems;Computers;Context;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection","artificial immune systems;multi-agent systems;security of data","activation threshold;adaptive immune subsystem;agent-based artificial immune systems;artificial T-cell agents;computer host;danger theory;danger value calculation;dendritic cell functionality;dentritic cells agents;human immune system;innate immune subsystem;intrusion detection systems;malicious behaviors;malicious intrusions;mature context antigen value calculation;multiagent-based IDS;security operating center","","1","","14","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new method is based on the inherent feature of the TCP protocol, that is, two communicating peers keep synchronized with each other using data acknowledgment. This feature is converted as a balance mechanism in interactive TCP traffic replay and incorporated into the current state-based method. In this way, the cost of state-checking can be significantly reduced and the replay performance is thus enhanced. To validate the effectiveness of the method we implement it by building an interactive replay system. The experimental results indicate that: 1) balance-checking reduces the overhead of state-checking by 40%; 2) the balance-based method enhances the overall replay performance by an average of 5% when the actual TCP traffic traces are replayed.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501960","","Communication system traffic control;Communications Society;Costs;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","","","","1","","17","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we ask the following question: How well can we classify malware according to network activity? We monitor the execution of a malware sample in a controlled environment and summarize the obtained high-level network information in a graph. We then analyze graphs similarity to determine whether such high-level behavioral profile is sufficient to provide accurate classification of malware samples.

Even though in most cases these techniques are effective enough, this paper describes how instead they can be detected using properly configured IDSs. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach named polymorphic blending exfiltration that serves to avoid detection from signature-based as well as anomaly-based IDSs. This technique permits to blend the exfiltrated data in the normal and legitimate traffic. We show how IDSs can be easily improved in order to be able to detect such exfiltration.

Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance.

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7980-6","","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions","Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching","","0","","24","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer.

Instead of relying on requirements checklists, security experts rely on their expertise and background knowledge to identify security vulnerabilities. To understand the gap between available checklists and practice, we conducted a series of interviews to encode the decision-making process of security experts and novices during security requirements analysis. Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts: source code, and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities. We framed our study using Situation Awareness-a cognitive theory from psychology-to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis. We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive, comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications, in addition, to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications. Our goal is to build a model that researchers can use to evaluate their security requirements methods against how experts transition through different situation awareness levels in their decision-making process.","","","","10.1109/ESPRE.2014.6890522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890522","Security;decision-making;patterns;requirements analysis;situation awareness","Decision making;Encoding;Firewalls (computing);Interviews;Software;Uncertainty","decision making;formal specification;security of data;source code (software)","coding theory;cognitive theory;decision-making patterns;decision-making process;grounded analysis;network diagrams;requirements checklist;security expertise;security experts;security requirements analysis;security vulnerabilities;situation awareness;source code;specifications ambiguity","","0","","20","","","25-25 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed surveillance system is used to detect fainted person at health care centers such as old folk's home, hospital, and handicapped center and is located at the place with good light condition. When a fainted person is detected, it send immediate signal and thus alerts/treatments can be carried out. In this system, a wireless webcam attached with a hyperbolic mirror is used to capture the omnidirectional scene at health care centers. The captured scenes are then fed into a laptop computer for image processing, faint detection and alarm purposing. Log-polar mapping is used to map the omnidirectional images into panoramic images. An effective faint detection algorithm is designed to detect a fainted human at health care centers. Experimental results show that the proposed wireless omnidirectional surveillance system achieves high accuracy (92.99% out of 10000 testing images under good light condition) in monitoring a selected private nursing home. The observed significances of this new proposed surveillance system include: omnidirectional (360°) cover age, high data compression output images, wireless, and with effective faint detection capability.","","978-0-7695-4043-6","","10.1109/ICCRD.2010.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5489523","Faint Detection Algorithm;Image processing;Log-Polar Mapping;Omnidirectional Surveillance system;Wireless","Algorithm design and analysis;Detection algorithms;Hospitals;Humans;Image processing;Layout;Medical services;Mirrors;Portable computers;Surveillance","data compression;health care;image processing;video surveillance","data compression output images;faint detection algorithm;handicapped center;health care centers;health care purposes;hyperbolic mirror;image processing;laptop computer;omnidirectional health care surveillance system;omnidirectional images;panoramic images;wireless webcam","","0","","11","","","7-10 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An n-variable interval function IN[n:A, B] is a mapping from{0,1}^n to {0,1}, where IN[n:A, B](X)=1 iff X is in the interval [A, B]. Such function is useful for packet classification in the internet, network intrusion detection system, etc. This paper considers the number of products to represent interval functions by sum-of-products expressions with two-valued and four-valued variables. It shows that to represent any interval function of n variables, an SOP with two-valued variables requires up to 2(n-2) products, while an SOP with four-valued variables requires at most n-1 products. These bounds are useful to estimate the size of a content addressable memory (CAM).","0195-623X","978-1-4244-6752-5","","10.1109/ISMVL.2010.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5489155","","Associative memory;CADCAM;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer science;Hardware;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Logic;Read-write memory;Web and internet services","","","","1","","17","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

COMPSAC '09. 33rd Annual IEEE International","20090922","2009","1","","392","399","The wide spread of worms poses serious challenges to today's Internet.Various IDSes (intrusion detection systems) have been proposed to identify or prevent such spread. These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance. We test the effectiveness of PAIDS with trace-driven simulations and show that PAIDS has a high detection rate and a low false positive rate.","0730-3157","978-0-7695-3726-9","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254234","Intrusion Detection System;Proximity;Worm","Application software;Collaborative work;Computer applications;Computer worms;Educational institutions;Failure analysis;Impedance;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis","Internet;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;PAIDS;anomaly detection;proximity-assisted intrusion detection system;signature-based scheme;unidentified worm","","0","","35","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore different input samples points can make different contributions to the learning of the decision surface - the optimal separating hyperplane. Then the model of intrusion detection system based on SVM is presented, and detailedly illustrated the performance of this model.

The aim of this paper is to present the challenges in employing forecasting approaches which could be aggregated to traditional ROSI techniques in IDS. In this study, trend analysis is based on moving averages and Fibonacci sequence. Tests applied upon two datasets (DARPA, KDD) indicate that the applied techniques define incidents trends; therefore, forecasting approach may be complementary to ROSI methods.","","978-1-4244-5647-5","","10.1109/ICITST.2009.5402622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5402622","","Economic forecasting;Geophysics computing;Information analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Investments;Meteorology;Seismology;Testing;Weather forecasting","Fibonacci sequences;investment;security of data","Fibonacci sequence;IDS 3G;ROSI techniques;computer systems;forecasting approach;information security field;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;moving averages sequence;security investment;unwanted traffic","","0","","30","","","9-12 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly detection is fast becoming a key element of intrusion detection systems, in which perturbations from normal behavior suggest the presence of intentionally or unintentionally induced attacks, faults, defects, etc. Accurately detecting such anomalies has become an important problem for the network community. We need to distinguish anomalies that change the traffic either abruptly or slowly. While a good amount of research has been done for fixed wired networks, not much research has been done in this area for wireless networks due to lack of a good data set.
