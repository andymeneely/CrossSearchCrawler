DFA representations are popular, but suffer from the state-explosion problem. We introduce a new matching structure: a tree of DFAs where the DFA associated with a node over-approximates those at its children, and the DFAs at the leaves represent the signature set. Matching works top-down, starting at the root of the tree and stopping at the first node whose DFA does not match. In the common case (benign traffic) matching does not reach the leaves. DFA-trees are built using Compact Overapproximate DFAs (CODFAs). A CODFA D' for D over-approximates the language accepted by D, has a smaller number of states than D, and has a low false-match rate. Although built from approximate DFAs, DFA-trees perform exact matching faster than a commonly used method, have a low memory overhead and a guaranteed good worst case performance.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847977","","Approximation error;Automata;Computers;Conferences;DH-HEMTs;Payloads;Training","computational complexity;deterministic automata;digital signatures;finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;tree data structures","CODFAs;DFA-trees;IPSs;NP-hard problem;benign traffic matching;compact overapproximate DFAs;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;intrusion prevention system;low false-match rate;low memory overhead;matching structure;parametrized language overapproximation;regular expressions;state-explosion problem;vulnerability signatures","","1","","30","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cluster heads themselves are evaluated by the base station. We develop an analytical model based on stochastic Petri nets for performance evaluation of the proposed trust-based intrusion detection scheme, as well as a statistical method for calculating the false alarm probability.

Some of the inspections one may make look for consistency with respect to data available only at the application layer, requiring one to position the analysis high in the protocol stack. Towards this end we propose a policy engine that examines both ingress and egress traffic to the AMI application layer. Policy engine rules may refer to the structure and behavior of the AMI protocol, and may also perform multi-stage analysis of data payloads looking for evidence that executable code is carried, rather than data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the policy engine is able to accurately distinguish between legitimate traffic and malware bearing traffic.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688003","","Encryption;Engines;Entropy;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","metering;power meters;power system security;protocols","AMI application layer;AMI control traffic;AMI protocol;advanced metering infrastructure;data payloads;deep packet inspection;malware propagation;multistage analysis;policy engine","","1","","25","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the security perspective, communication between mobile nodes via wireless links make these networks more susceptible to internal or external attacks because any one can join and move the network at any time. In general, Packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s) is one of the possible attack in the mobile ad hoc network. This paper emphasized to develop an intrusion detection system using fuzzy Logic to detect the packet dropping attack from the mobile ad hoc networks and also remove the malicious nodes in order to save the resources of mobile nodes.

Moreover, as the size of rule set is increasing to tens of thousands, novel packet classification algorithms must have good scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel packet classification algorithm named DBS (discrete bit selection) which takes a bit level heuristic design to partition the rule set effectively. To the best of our knowledge, DBS is the first try to design a heuristic classification algorithm at bit-level. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, DBS is deployed on a popular multi-core network processor platform, compared with two existing well-known algorithms. Experimental results show that DBS achieves 300% higher throughput than HiCuts and HSM, while the memory requirement is reduced to about 10% averagely. DBS works well especially with large rule set (10K), which trends a good scalability.","1521-9097","978-1-4244-5788-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395268","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;High-speed networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Satellite broadcasting;Scalability;Throughput","Internet;pattern classification","bit level heuristic design;bit-level heuristic packet classification algorithm;discrete bit selection;high speed Internet;multicore network processor platform","","5","","19","","","8-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Understanding how and why spoofing attacks are used, combined with a few simple prevention methods, can help protect your network from these malicious cloaking and cracking techniques.. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used to secure these environments for sharing their data over network and host based IDS approaches. The rapid improvements of intrusions in internet and other networks are the main factors responsible for the propagation of different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing environment. Now a days the Ids makes use of the signature based detection approach which detects the actions based on analyzing the patterns such as text, password, time etc. So this will create difficulties in updating information and detecting unknown attacks. In this paper we make use of an improved EADS (Exception Agent Detection System) for making the header information secure. Packet filtering is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. In this paper, we also propose an inter-domain packet_filter (IDPF) architecture that can mitigate the level of IP spoofing on the Interne together with the IDS. We establish the conditions under which the IDPF framework works correctly in that it does not discard packets with valid source addresses. In this paper we propose an improved behavioral method for combating the unknown threats other tha- the usual context and content scanning techniques.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738791","Exception agent system;IP spoofing;Intrusion detection system;Local area network;packet filter","Computer architecture;Computer science;Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Intrusion detection","IP networks;Internet;digital signatures;security of data","IP spoofing attack;Internet;TCP/IP network;content scanning techniques;cracking techniques;exception agent detection system;interdomain packet filter architecture;intrusion detection system;malicious cloaking;packet filtering;signature based detection","","1","","12","","","27-29 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each new proposal and technique arrives with great promise and anticipated success as research teams struggle to develop new and innovative responses to emerging threats. Unfortunately, these techniques frequently fall short of expectation when deployed due to difficulties with false alarms, trouble operating in a non-idealized or new domain, or flexibility limiting assumptions which are only valid with specific input sets. We believe these failures are due to fundamental problems with the experimental method for evaluating the effectiveness of new ideas and techniques. This work explores the effect of a poorly understood data synthesis process on the evaluation of IA devices. The point of an evaluation is to independently determine what a detector can and cannot detect, i.e. the metric of detection. This can only be done when the data contains carefully controlled ground truth. We broadly define the term “similarity class” to facilitate discussion about the different ways data (and more specifically test data) can be similar, and use these ideas to illustrate the pre-requisites for correct evaluation of anomaly detectors. We focus on how anomaly detectors function and should be evaluated in 2 specific domains with disparate system architectures and data: a sensor and data transport network for air frame tracking and display, and a deep space mission spacecraft command link. Finally, we present empirical evidence illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in these domains, and introduce the entropy of a time series sensor as a critical measure of data similarity for test data in these domains.","","978-1-4244-6047-2","","10.1109/THS.2010.5655105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655105","data generation;experimental method;information assurance;similarity classes","Detectors;Entropy;Generators;Markov processes;Measurement;Radar tracking;Space vehicles","aerospace computing;data handling;security of data","IA devices;air frame tracking;anomaly detector;data synthesis process;data transport network;information assurance technique","","0","","16","","","8-10 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks are gaining popularity because of the availability of low cost mobile devices and its ability to provide instant wireless networking capabilities. MANET is an infrastructure less network and there is no central administration. The open medium, wide distribution of nodes, changing topology and no centralized monitoring makes MANETs vulnerable to malicious attackers. For these types of networks, security is the most essential service to provide protection and prevent malicious attacks occurring in the mobile nodes. Attackers can easily compromise MANETs by inserting malicious or non cooperative nodes into the network. To compensate MANET from these malicious activities in this paper, it is proposed a new intrusion detection & prevention algorithm named as Packet Dropping detection Algorithm (PDA). MANETs depends on the cooperation of nodes in the network for the forwarding of packets to the destination. The Cooperation requires detecting routes on the neighbor nodes.

The present day security environment demands security mechanisms that rarely fail. In this paper we have tried to take a step further towards foolproof security. The present security measures are based on binary principle. The security mechanisms and procedures adopted at present make the software system strong up to a point and then fail catastrophically. In this paper we have tried to explore some innovative measures and proposed a new approach which will henceforth be named as “Secure Software System (SSS)”. Here we have tried to avert the failed state of the system by induction of `Fuzzy Logic'. This will help us to evolve intermediate stages between the safe state and failed state for security goals and resultant security level to be constantly monitored by actors associated with this arrangement. These actors will be prompt in taking additional countermeasures to strengthen the since applied mitigation policies for different threats before the attacker is successful in his mission. These measures will break the jinx of brittleness in between the two states which has gone unattended so far.","","978-1-4244-6347-3","","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5486061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486061","SSS;fuzzy logic;security requirementss;software agents;threat modeling","Capacitive sensors;Condition monitoring;Data security;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Pervasive computing;Risk management;Software agents;Software measurement;Software systems","fuzzy logic;risk management;security of data;software agents;software engineering;system recovery","binary based security mechanism;foolproof security;fuzzy logic;risk management;secure software system","","0","","28","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs)","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors","cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","2","","49","","2012-02-14","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The natural traffic granularity is the flow between packet and circuit and between connection-less and connection-oriented modes. Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of “knowledge plane” and “network mining.”","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.20371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781206","","","","","","0","4","","","","Summer 2009","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

The proposed scheme is based on a logical ring architecture, which permits to alleviate the task of the group controller in maintaining the group key.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cloud service providers foresee it as a source of promising financial gains, the clients find it a convenient solution where the enterprises may get started on their computing activities without investing on the in-house facilities of hardware and software. They can outsource the computing and archiving activities to the cloud service providers (CSP) though Internet. There are many dimensions of these activities and the researchers are trying to find acceptable solutions for the industry. In this paper, we have focused on the information security issues when migrating to a cloud environment. The confidence of end user can be won partially by the guarantees of service provider and use of cryptographic techniques. It is important that the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) should be included in the models which support forensic study whenever required. It is equally important to address the issue of anti-forensic methods that the service providers may use to hide their malicious activities. Therefore the clients would like to have a better, in-depth knowledge of information management at service providers' end. For this purpose tools to probe into the cloud services are required. To elaborate on this issue we have chosen the data archiving and storage model used for medical service providers and hospitals. It is a classic test-case where Patients' history has to be maintained under the guidelines of HIPPA. The Amazon security model has been reviewed for this purpose both for archiving and disaster recovery. An acceptable security model over the cloud architecture is also proposed.","","978-1-4244-9922-9","","10.1109/HONET.2010.5715771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715771","CFT;CSP;HIPPA;IDS;TPA","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Forensics;Hospitals;Medical diagnostic imaging;Security","cloud computing;computer forensics;cryptography","ICT;IDS;cloud computing;cloud security;forensics model;information and communication technologies;intrusion detection system","","5","","30","","","19-21 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction. As extensions, the model is applied over a path and an aggregated model that applies to a neighborhood in the network is also presented.

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method","","0","","30","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network level attack detection solutions focus on the information in the headers of network packets. While, application level attack detection solutions investigate the data fragments carried out in the packet payloads.

Even a rare vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network security of an entire organisation. Intrusion Detection Systems form an integral component of the mechanisms designed to prevent internet and data communication systems from such attacks. The attacks on the network comprise of information gathering and modification through unauthorized access to resources and denial of service to legitimate users. IDS play a key role in detecting the patterns of behaviour on the network that might be indicative of impending attacks. Majority of groundbreaking research on IDS is carried out on KDD'99 dataset and focuses on either all the attacks in the network or the attacks corresponding to TCP/IP protocol. This paper presents a step forward in this direction where the IDS model addresses a specific part of the network attacks commonly detected at port 7 in UDP. Port scans in UDP account for a sizable portion of the Internet traffic and comparatively little research characterizes security in UDP port scan activity. To meet the growing trend of attacks and other security challenges in the constantly evolving internet arena, this is paper presents a computationally intelligent intrusion detection mechanism using swarm intelligence paradigm, particularly ant colony optimisation, to analyze sample network traces in UDP port scans. This work aims at generating customised and efficient network intrusion detection systems using soft computing to increase general network security through specific network security.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745415","Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO);Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);User Datagram Protocol (UDP);attacks;network security;perpetual echo;port scans","Computers;Internet;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems","ant colony optimisation;computer network security;transport protocols","Internet traffic;TCP/IP protocol;ant colony optimization;computer network security;computer networks escalating complexity;denial of service;intelligent intrusion detection mechanism;intelligent perpetual echo attack detection;malicious exploitation probability;unauthorized access;user datagram protocol port 7","","0","","18","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem. In particular, our scheme incorporates a list technique, namely the blacklist to help filter network packets based on the confidence of the IP domains.

Our approach introduces the relevant theories of label switching path in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and makes use of routing path to set up a Trace back Path (TP).

Each of these will expose the power grid to cyber security threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a Distributed Intrusion Detection System for Smart Grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the Analyzing Module (AM) in the multiple layers of smart grids. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid - the home area network (HAN), neighborhood area network (NAN), and the Wide Area Network (WAN) - where they will use Artificial Immune System (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyber attacks. AMs at each level will be trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection. Simulation results demonstrate that this is a promising methodology for identifying malicious network traffic and improving system security.","1944-9925","978-1-4577-1000-1","978-1-4577-1001-8","10.1109/PES.2011.6039697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6039697","artificial immune system;cyber security;data classification;intrusion detection;smart grid","Classification algorithms;Communication networks;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Smart grids","Internet;Zigbee;artificial immune systems;computer network security;hierarchical systems;smart power grids;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks","Internet-like communication network;Zigbee protocol;artificial immune system;cyber attack;cyber security threat;distributed hierarchical network architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;home area network;malicious network traffic;neighborhood area network;smart power grid;wide area network;wireless technology","","3","","33","","","24-29 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While implementing Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) its major problem security is widely addressed, but various challenges still persist such as the different kinds of misbehavior of node may be exhibits, detection of routing misbehavior and collusion of misbehaving nodes has not been adequately addressed yet. One such solution to overcome selfishly behaving nodes in wireless network is to detect and exclude them .There are several secure routing protocols to detect routing misbehavior in the direct neighborhood. In this paper, we presented an improved version of Leak detector mechanism and iterative probing mechanism to detect colluding malicious nodes, manipulations of route in wireless multi hop networks. Leak detector enables the calculation of the packet-loss ratio for the individual nodes. Iterative probing enables reliable detection of selfish nodes that drop packets in a MANET. Our Simulation results of these mechanisms shows that they are highly adaptable, reliable and most effective way to identify any selfish behaviors, routing and collusion of misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019683","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019683","Iterative Probing and Collusion;Leak detector;MANET;Routing","Cryptography;Detectors;Mobile ad hoc networks;Probes;Routing;Routing protocols","iterative methods;leak detection;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","MANET;colluding malicious node detection;collusion attack;iterative probing mechanism;leak detector mechanism;mobile ad hoc network;mobile communication;packet-loss ratio;routing misbehavior detection;secure routing protocol;selfish node detection;ubiquitous network;wireless multihop network","","0","","24","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The P2P protocol is working behind such online sharing websites and resources. The cyber cell is very active now in various parts of the country to trace and fraudulent sharing of files when reported. So it is necessary to have an efficient mechanism to find the actual content which is being uploaded or downloaded from a particular machine as part of network forensic investigation. Usually P2P websites and services are blocked in enterprises and educational institutions to avoid sharing of unwanted digital assets and also to increase internet bandwidth.

To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect attacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes in the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The experiments conducted on the system have shown that it has high detection efficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing systems.","","978-1-4244-7675-6","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679879","","Bayesian methods;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Intrusion detection;Lead;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing","distributed processing;security of data;software agents;software fault tolerance","IDS;autonomous agents;cooperating agents;fault-tolerant distributed intrusion detection system;malicious intruders;networked system security;robust distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","10","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most widely used tools is honeyd for creating honeypots. The logs generated by honeyd can grow very large in size when there is heavy attack traffic in the system, thus consuming a lot of disk space. The huge log size poses difficulty when they are processed and analyzed by security analysts as they consume a lot of time and resources. In this paper, we propose a system which addresses these issues. It has two important modules. The first one is logging module which saves disk space by reducing the log size without losing information. The second module is a log analyzer that can process this log to generate reports and graphs for the security administrators. The analyzer is backward compatible and can process the log file produced by honeyd as well.

The purpose of modeling is to construct the formal model of network security situation measurement based upon the D-S evidence theory, and support the general process of fusing and analyzing security alert events collected from security situation sensors. The generation of network security situation is to extract the frequent patterns and sequential patterns from the dataset of network security situation based upon knowledge discovery method and transform these patterns to the correlation rules of network security situation, and finally to automatically generate the network security situation graph.

It is based on computing the sum of character's values in the search string and comparing this sum with the sum of the values of the corresponding characters in the sliding window. The sliding window includes number of characters equals that of the search string and is right shifted from the beginning and toward the end of the input string.

The deployment of sensor nodes in an optimal arrangement while overcoming the unique challenges posed by the surrounding medium and energy constraints on the sensors is a non-trivial task for real-world applications. As these characteristics are anisotropic with respect to change in temperature, salinity, depth, pH, and transmission frequency, they need to be accounted for in a dynamic simulation to preconfigure a stable physical network layout of nodes. A strategy based on computational intelligence techniques that takes into consideration these factors to achieve a viable configuration with the available resources is of prime importance. The proposed methodology uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique for the positioning and deployment of UWSN nodes to maximize the coverage provided to protect a high-value asset (HVA) in a military application.

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms.

In a large monitoring environment where targets are distributed over an entire monitored region, deploying static sensors leads to high hardware costs because a high number of sensors may be required to achieve network connectivity. This paper considers the target-patrol issue where a set of mobile data mules (DMs) are dispatched to efficiently patrol the given targets under a predefined time constraint. The targets are assigned weights indicating their importance, where more important targets should be visited more frequently by the DMs. Accordingly, this paper proposes a time-constrained weighted targets patrolling (TCWTP) algorithm for locally constructing efficient patrol paths, thereby ensuring globally stable intervals between visits to all target points. A performance analysis revealed that the proposed TCWTP mechanism outperforms existing works in terms of the average interval between visits, quality of monitoring satisfaction ratio, and monitoring fairness ratio.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2014.2378212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000577","Data collection;sweep coverage;target coverage;target {coverage};weighted target patrolling;wireless mobile sensor networks (WMSNs);wireless mobile sensor {networks} (WMSNs)","Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Time factors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile communication;wireless sensor networks","DM;TCWTP algorithm;deploying static sensors;mobile data mules;monitored region;monitoring environment;monitoring fairness ratio;monitoring satisfaction ratio;time constrained weighted targets patrolling;time constrained weighted targets patrolling mechanism;wireless mobile sensor networks","","0","","31","","2014-12-31","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to overcome that issue, we proposed a new framework for malware behavior identification and classification that apply dynamic approach.

Existing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are found to be limited in performance and utility especially once subjected to heavy traffic conditions. It has been observed that NIDS become less effective even when presented with a bandwidth of a few hundred megabits per second. In this work, we have endeavored to identify the causes which lead to unsatisfactory performance of NIDSs. In this regard, we have conducted an extensive performance evaluation of an open source intrusion detection system (Snort). This has been done on a highly sophisticated test-bench with different traffic conditions. We have also used different hardware and software platforms to determine the efficacy of the NIDS under test. Finally, in our results/ analysis, we have identified the factors responsible for the limited performance of Snort.

Sensor malfunctions or abnormal usages of the system are possible scenarios in a real life and a surveillance system with hundreds of sensors is creating a vast amount of data which is impossible to handle manually. This renders the fixing of these potential faults slow and expensive. This paper proposes a system which can analyse data received from a surveillance system. The proposed system will report abnormal activities, such as malfunctioning or dead sensors, abnormal usage, and abnormal events created by the surveillance system. The experimental evaluation is performed by using six cases describing different types of abnormal activity. The experiments indicate that the proposed system can effectively pinpoint faulty sensors and other abnormal activities.

In this paper, we propose an evasion technique to the Snort NIDS which exploits its flowbits feature. We specify the flowbit evasion attack and provide practical algorithms to solve it with controllable false positives and formally prove their correctness and completeness. We implemented a tool called SFET which can automatically parse a Snort rule set, generate all possible sequences that can evade it, as well as produce a patch to guard the rule set against those evasions.

However because the mobile communication device has relatively poor computing power and inconvenient user interface, it may experience performance deterioration and user inconveniency in case that it employs all the security functions. This paper proposes a context-aware dynamic security configuration scheme for effective security management of the mobile communication device.

By fraudulently consuming web resources in sufficient volume (i.e. data transferred out of the cloud), an attacker (e.g. botnet) is able to incur significant fraudulent charges to the victim.

This calls for providing advanced intrusion detection. To meet this requirement, we introduce IDAR, a signature- and log-based distributed intrusion detector dedicated to ad hoc routing protocols. Contrary to existing systems that observe packets, IDAR analyses the logs generated by the OLSR protocol and identifies patterns of misuse. This detector copes with the resource-constraints of devices by providing distributed detection. In particular, depending on the level of suspicion/gravity involved, in-depth cooperative investigation is launched. Simulation shows limited bandwidth usage, high detection and low false positives.","","978-1-4577-1378-1","","10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6314289","Intrusion detection;MANETs;misuse;routing protocols","Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","IDAR;MANET;OLSR protocol;ad hoc networks;ad hoc routing protocols;advanced intrusion detection;bandwidth usage;log based distributed intrusion detector;log based intrusion detection","","0","","17","","","27-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses the different types of cloud computing technology and discusses the results of our research survey which was designed to examine the obstacles preventing organizations from adopting cloud (with a particular focus on the security issues). Future work will include the development and testing of an e-learning tool using virtualization, web services and open source platforms to assess the feasibility of adopting cloud technology with minimal security fears. The work will produce recommendations to organizations wishing to adopt cloud technology. Finally it will evaluate the effectiveness of the Cloud in the learning environment.","","978-1-4799-4326-5","","10.1109/CISIS.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915509","Daaa;IaaS;PaaS;SaaS;cloud security;computing;e-learning;open source platforms;virtualisation;web services","Cloud computing;Organizations;Security;Servers;Standards organizations","Web services;cloud computing;computer aided instruction;public domain software;security of data;virtualisation","Web services;cloud computing;e-learning tool;information technology;learning environment;obstacles preventing organization;open source software;security issue;virtualisation","","0","","28","","","2-4 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
