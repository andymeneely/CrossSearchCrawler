In this scenario, operators and service providers constantly face the challenge of delivering the best possible value for end-users without compromising revenue, reliability or performance. This balance can only be achieved through a comprehensive management approach, ideally capable of providing an end-to-end coverage of the critical aspects involved in the delivery process and covering the infrastructure, services and devices. In this paper we present the main results of a PhD Dissertation that addressed the challenge of providing service providers with adequate service and device management mechanisms. First, we extended the industry de facto standard for remote management of devices and services on the customer's premises (the CWMP/TR069 framework), in order to increase its scope and flexibility. Afterwards, on top of those extensions, we proposed and investigated an array of innovative approaches for device, service, desktop and security management. Overall, those approaches allow operators to simplify their operations, enabling the improvement of current services as well as the introduction of novel services.","","978-1-4673-5229-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573114","CWMP;Home Networks;Network Management","Broadband communication;Data models;Local area networks;Media;Protocols;Servers;Standards","computer network management;home networks;local area networks;subscriber loops","CWMP/TR069 framework;broadband access technology;comprehensive management;device management mechanism;device remote management;industry de facto standard;management framework;residential LAN;residential broadband environment;service management mechanism;service provider","","0","","28","","","27-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complexity of the method to analyze these relationships, the time to complete the analysis, the robustness and trustworthiness of the method are important features to be considered. In this paper, we propose using Extended Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (E-FCMs) to analyze the relationships between risk factors and risks, and adopting a pessimistic approach to assess the overall risk of a system or a project. E-FCMs are suggested by Hagiwara to represent causal relationships more naturally. The main differences between E-FCMs and conventional Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are the following: E-FCMs have nonlinear membership functions, conditional weights, and time delay weights. Therefore E-FCMs are suitable for risk analysis as all features of E-FCMs are more informative and can fit the needs of Risk Analysis. In this paper we suggest a framework to analyze risks using E-FCMs and extend E-FCMs themselves by introducing a special graphical representation for risk analysis. We also suggest a framework for group decision making using E-FCMs. Particularly, we explore the Software Project Management (SPM) and discuss risk analysis of SPM applying E-FCMs.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2011.2134730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5756213","Fuzzy cognitive maps;project management;risk analysis","Decision making;Delay effects;Fuzzy cognitive maps;Random access memory;Risk analysis;Software;Taxonomy","decision making;risk analysis;software management","extended fuzzy cognitive maps;group decision making;risk analysis graphical representation;risk impact factor analysis;risk management;software project management","","3","","31","","2011-04-25","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Related work on BDI construction and implementation are reviewed. An attack simulation is constructed to illustrate how to launch a BDI attack.

Current systems implementing intrusion detection processes observe traffic at several data collecting points in the network but analysis is often centralized or partly centralized. These systems are not scalable and suffer from the single point of failure, i.e. attackers only need to target the central node to compromise the whole system. This paper proposes an anomaly-based fully distributed network intrusion detection system where analysis is run at each data collecting point using a naive Bayes classifier. Probability values computed by each classifier are shared among nodes using an iterative average consensus protocol. The final analysis is performed redundantly and in parallel at the level of each data collecting point, thus avoiding the single point of failure issue. We run simulations focusing on DDoS attacks with several network configurations, comparing the accuracy of our fully distributed system with a hierarchical one. We also analyze communication costs and convergence speed during consensus phases.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292913","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Convergence;Intrusion detection;Joints;Network topology;Training","Bayes methods;computer network security;pattern classification","DDoS attacks;anomaly-based fully distributed network intrusion detection system;consensus based network intrusion detection system;data collecting point;iterative average consensus protocol;naïve Bayes classifier;probability values","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS.

A specific attack called Wormmhole attack enables an attacker to record packets at one location in the network, tunnels them to another location, and retransmits them into the network. In this paper, we present a protocol for detecting wormhole attacks without use of any special harware such as directional antenna and precise synchronised clock and the protocol is also independent of physical medium of wireless network. After the route discovery, source node initiates wormhole detection process in the established path which counts hop difference between the neighbours of the one hop away nodes in the route. The destination node detects the wormhole if the hop difference between neighbours of the nodes exceeds the acceptable level. Our simulation results shows that the WHOP is quite excellent in detecting wormhole of large tunnel lengths.","","978-1-4577-0311-9","","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2011.5893822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5893822","","Ad hoc networks;Delay;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Synchronization","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;synchronisation","MANET routing;WHOP;clock synchronisation;directional antenna;hound packet;malicious activity;routing protocol;wormhole attack detection protocol","","6","","15","","","25-27 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because on-demand service provisioning for applications and data will be used by hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of users simultaneously, a successful intrusion would not only expose sensitive data, but it could also completely cut users off from both applications and/or data. This paper examines the underlying security risks inherent to the CC paradigm, compares approaches to mitigate known security risks, and offers a solution that leverages intelligent multi-agent systems and network data ontologies to provide automated defense for both known and unknown malware security risks.

In this paper, we propose a regex pattern grouping scheme based on a new DFA model called Pattern-Based DFA (P-DFA) which supports efficient pattern-based op-erations, such as insertion, deletion, and etc. By using these basic operations, one can easily measure the state explo-sion when combining a set of regex patterns into a single DFA.

We have designed and successfully developed a lightweight and platform independent low cost file monitoring approach and tool for securing important files from modifications in Cloud environment. The tool solves the issue of tampering with important files from VM users even if the user is intelligent enough to exploit operating system specific vulnerabilities for getting elevated privileges to perform such operations. The tool is light weight and independent as it does not require any support for file signature management that requires hash databases for storage of file integrity, and can be applied to any platform and environment with minimal changes and support. The novelty of approach lies in storing the signature of the file contents which is utilized for integrity monitoring in the file itself.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

The latest security initiatives in the field of aviation propose the aircraft carriers to implement video surveillance within the aircraft at strategic locations. The current proposals allow the video surveillance data to be stored within the aircraft and monitored by one of the flight crew. The monitoring crew will be responsible for identifying the anomaly within the aircraft and take necessary preventive actions. With the introduction of additional technology within the aircraft, mere human perception may not be sufficient to make a decision. In this research work, the authors explore the possibility of implementing a smart video surveillance system (SVSS) within the aircraft that is tuned toward detecting the behavioral anomaly within the aircraft. The SVSS will generate security triggers when it detects an anomaly within the aircraft. These triggers could be combined with other triggers generated by different aircraft components (possible alarms from the flight crew, data traffic anomaly, or alarm generated by one of the avionics components) to provide a better understanding of the situation to the monitoring crew.","0885-8985","","","10.1109/MAES.2009.5317783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5317783","","Aerospace electronics;Air traffic control;Aircraft;Data security;Humans;Intelligent systems;Monitoring;Proposals;Safety;Video surveillance","aerospace safety;avionics;security of data;video surveillance","SVSS;aircraft component;anomaly detection;aviation safety;flight crew;human perception;intelligent video surveillance system;smart video surveillance system;strategic location","","2","","13","","","Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes the Primary-Secondary trust node placement algorithm (P-S algorithm) to identify the set of primary and secondary trust nodes to address the above issue. In case of faults, secondary trust nodes will be activated immediately to avoid the cost of identifying the alternative trust nodes during runtime. Comparisons between the original trust node placement and the proposed P-S algorithm are performed based on a network under different tolerant levels.

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7754-8","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496","","Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols","","","","1","","24","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","","978-1-4673-2433-5","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.","","","","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947","Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis","Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine","","0","","21","","","24-26 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches.

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally. In presence of attacker security scheme always provides the secure path and through multipath routing the possibility of secure routing is enhanced. Simulation results and PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) values of each node clearly shows better network performance in case of security scheme in presence of Jamming attack.","2347-9337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012891","AOMDV;Attack;MANET;Routing;Security","Bandwidth;Jamming;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","jamming;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDR;enhanced security scheme;jamming attack;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing protocol AOMDV;network topology;packet delivery ratio;security design;unauthorized packets","","0","","8","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increasing usage of interactive internet applications in the areas of stock trades, medicine, weather forecasting, banks, businesses, education, defense, research etc. has induced a rise in risks and possibilities of misuse of computer networks. Over the last decade, malicious software or malware in the form of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, Botnets has risen to become a primary source of most of the threats used for scanning, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) activities and direct attacks, taking place across the Internet. A number of solutions have been proposed in literature to defend against such threats from malware. Majority of these solutions uses the concept of inbound traffic approach for detection. The main goal of this paper is to work out a pragmatic solution to protect the network from the malware by exploring the feasibility of the concept of analysis of outbound traffic i.e Extrusion traffic only instead of intrusion traffic. Four different types of malware have been analyzed to check the validity of the proposed approach.","","978-1-4577-1385-9","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075135","Botnet;C & C server;DDoS;Extrusion;Intrusion;Malware;Zombie;bot","Computers;Internet;Intrusion detection;Malware;Measurement;Monitoring","Internet;computer network security;invasive software","Trojan horses;botnets;computer network;direct attacks;distributed denial-of-service activity;experimental analysis;extrusions;inbound traffic approach;interactive Internet applications;malicious software;malware detection;viruses;worms","","0","","23","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the fact that diversified networking technologies are implemented, the networks have become leaky. Hence networks are becoming more vulnerable and as a result attacks on networks are intensifying. Although firewalls and routers are deployed, they are not sufficient. Intrusion detection systems monitor and inspect the packets traversing over a network ensuring deep packet analysis. But as the attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated, IDS available today are unable to address challenges that surround different types of attacks, since they are designed to handle specific types of attacks only. It is evident that no single technique can guarantee protection against future attacks. Hence there is a need for integrated architecture which can provide robust protection against a complete spectrum of threats.

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can deliver satisfactory system performance with less network load.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356567","","Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Computer architecture;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis","security of data","DARPA dataset;attack tools;collaborative architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;network technologies;noncentral analyzer;one-level hierarchy dIDS;security","","3","","31","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If he is away he dials back to the home telephone number with an additional digit to trigger ON the fire extinguisher. By dialing further digits he can switch off selected electrical appliances which might have activated the fire. Also, an intruder detector circuit incorporated with the telephone automatically dials digits to reach a public emergency service and upon receiving the response the attachment unit extends a recorded voice message to the called end informing about the intrusion. As these are simple means of maintaining the home security they can easily be adopted to any environment. Alternatively, with cell phone installed in home for this purpose the above techniques are implemented. This design has more security concerns as a microcontroller checks password and allows the switching process of appliances to take place.

However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization method, which is not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, the proposed ABC-SVM model is applied to determine free parameters of SVM and feature selection at building intrusion detection system. The standard ABC is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine and the binary ABC is to obtain the optimum feature selection for IDSs from KDD Cup 99 data set.

IDS for MANETs have attracted much attention recently and thus, there are many publications that propose new IDS solutions or improvements to the existing. In this paper, we study the different existing IDS architectures for MANETs. We briefly present for each architecture, after an analysis, the strengths and weaknesses, the methods/techniques that have been proposed to improve the performances and the provided security services. Then, we propose a new IDS architecture for MANETs, this architecture is a combination model hierarchical based on clusters and cooperation model based on a multi-agent system (SMA).

The proposed detection system maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross-layer features to define a routing behavior. For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed. Experiments based on simulation show that the proposed cross-layer approach aided by a combination of SVM and FDA performs significantly better than other existing approaches.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374416","Cross-layer design;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;routing attacks;sinking.","","ad hoc networks;radio networks;support vector machines;telecommunication security","Fisher discriminant analysis;MAC layer;autonomous host-based intrusion detection;cross-layer detection;malicious node behavior;malicious sinking behavior;packet drop ratio;security vulnerabilities;support vector machines;traffic density;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","28","","2010-01-08","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The need for new countermeasures is clear and urgent as cyber-attacks are more than ever capable of causing loss of human life; destroying the environment, and causing a high level of disruption to critical infrastructures. The impact of cyber-attacks is sometimes comparable to the impact of traditional military actions. However, the lack of understanding of the scope of attacks and how they operate could lead to unsuccessful protection mechanisms. We have analysed attacks targeting IT and business network, and Critical infrastructure, as a result we present four levels of visibility of attacks that need to be considered when designing or implementing security mechanisms. In our discussion of these four levels of visibility of attacks, we particularly focus on one level where malicious users actions are direct threats to the targeted system but yet not visible by the targeted systems. We conclude by presenting our detection and mitigation framework concept.","","978-1-4577-1329-3","","10.1109/IMSAA.2011.6156366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6156366","Attack Analysis;Attack Framework;Attack Mitigation;Attack Visibility;Critical Infrastructure Protection;Drive By Download;Firewall;Google Hacking;IDS","Computers;Google;IP networks;Malware;Search engines;Servers","security of data","cyber-attacks;detection framework;distributed attack detection;mitigation framework;protection mechanism;security mechanism","","1","","27","","","12-13 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).","1550-6002","978-1-4244-8078-4","978-0-7695-4131-0","10.1109/QSIC.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949","Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing","computer network security;program testing","IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing","","3","","21","","","14-15 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks.

This distributed mechanism enables our system to effectively operate within large scale and high traffic rate networks. We developed a grouping mechanism which divides computers in the network into subsets of computers with a leader and a few members. Subsequently, using a data sharing mechanism we were able to detect distributed attacks. Our data sharing mechanism added an overhead on the network traffic which is negligible compared to the overall network traffic. We simulated our method in NS2 simulation environment. Then we compared our proposed system with a centralized IDS in terms of detection rate, memory usage and packet loss rate.

However, the goal of recent hacking attacks has changed from leaking information and destruction of services to attacking large-scale systems such as critical infrastructures and state agencies. In the other words, existing defence technologies to counter these attacks are based on pattern matching methods which are very limited. Because of this fact, in the event of new and previously unknown attacks, detection rate becomes very low and false negative increases. To defend against these unknown attacks, which cannot be detected with existing technology, we propose a new model based on big data analysis techniques that can extract information from a variety of sources to detect future attacks.

Filters (ACLs) are already available in the routers today but are a scarce resource because they are stored in expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a framework for studying filter selection as a resource allocation problem. Within this framework, we study four practical cases of source address/prefix filtering, which correspond to different attack scenarios and operator's policies. We show that filter selection optimization leads to novel variations of the multidimensional knapsack problem and we design optimal, yet computationally efficient, algorithms to solve them. We also evaluate our approach using data from Dshield.org and demonstrate that it brings significant benefits in practice.

"SAW: Java Synchronization Selection from Lock or Software Transactional Memory","Yamada, Y.; Iwasaki, H.; Ugawa, T.","Dept. of Comput.

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.","1521-9097","978-1-4577-1875-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266","Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization","Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving","Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing","Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we present a method for automatic generation of fuzzy rules from data. The main advantage of the proposed method is its ability to perform data clustering without the requirement of predefining any parameters including number of clusters. The proposed method creates data clusters at different levels of granulation and selects the best clustering results based on some measures. The proposed method involves merging clusters into new clusters that have a coarser granulation. To evaluate performance of the proposed method, three different datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed method to other classifiers: SVM classifier, FCM fuzzy classifier, subtractive clustering fuzzy classifier. Results show that the proposed method has better classification results than other classifiers for all the datasets used.","","","","10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116825","Fuzzy systems;data classification;data clustering;granular computing","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data models;Input variables;Merging;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;pattern clustering","FCM fuzzy classifier;SVM classifier;automatic generation;coarser granulation;data clustering;fuzzy classification rules;fuzzy modelling;granulation-based adaptive clustering;subtractive clustering fuzzy classifier","","0","","20","","","13-16 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this point, we formally define model-based intrusion detection and present a generic generation algorithm for program models on a provided abstraction domain. Eventually, we discuss how to use this mechanism to implement a real intrusion detection model proposed by us before.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598041","abstract interpretation;intrusion detection;static analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Concrete;Intrusion detection;Registers;Semantics","security of data","abstract interpretation;generic generation algorithm;model based intrusion detection;runtime behavior process","","0","","7","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The conventional algorithms of snorts mostly are evaluated as low-powered detection tools. In contrast, recent algorithms are able to detect intrusion properly. The major weakness in modern detection methods is that the power of IDS is restricted only to the network on which these intelligent algorithms are applied. This paper presents a new method to solve issues considering locality. We have classified any attacks to networks in the form of a protocol in the application layer which could be saved later in any and/or all of verified servers as rules. Thus all snorts across the inter-networks would be aware of the attack with enough details to immune itself. The major advantage of this method is that the old snorts strategies can also use possibilities of the new snorts dispersed over the network. We will evaluate this method and show that the resulted traffic is balanced across the Internet without imposing considerable overheads.","","978-0-7695-3930-0","978-1-4244-5423-5","10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5385146","Classification;IDS;Rule;Snort","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer network management;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Network servers;Power engineering computing;Protection;Protocols","computer network security;pattern classification","application layer protocol;attacks classification;computer network;low powered detection tool;snort intrusion detection systems","","1","","11","","","25-27 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both problems can be addressed in two different ways, either by misuse detection or anomaly-based detection. In this paper, we propose a weighted-dissimilarity-based anomaly detection method that can effectively identify abnormal behavior such as mobility patterns of mobile wireless networks. In the proposed algorithm, a normal profile is constructed from normal mobility patterns of mobile nodes in mobile wireless networks. From the constructed normal profile, the dissimilarity is computed by a weighted dissimilarity measure. If the computed dissimilarity value is greater than the dissimilarity threshold that is a system parameter, an alert message is occurred. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation. From the result of the simulation, we know that the proposed method is superior to the performance of anomaly detection methods using other dissimilarity measures.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283011","Anomaly Detection;Dissimilarity Measures;Mobile Wireless Networks;Mobility Pattern","Authentication;Cellular networks;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Pollution measurement;Weight measurement;Wireless networks","mobile radio;telecommunication security","mobile wireless network;mobility pattern;network identity theft;network intrusion;weighted-dissimilarity-based anomaly detection","","0","","8","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach has been shown to be ineffective as it presents the risk information of each app in a “stand-alone” fashion and in a way that requires too much technical knowledge and time to distill useful information. We discuss the desired properties of risk signals and relative risk scores for Android apps in order to generate another metric that users can utilize when choosing apps. We present a wide range of techniques to generate both risk signals and risk scores that are based on heuristics as well as principled machine learning techniques. Experimental results conducted using real-world data sets show that these methods can effectively identify malware as very risky, are simple to understand, and easy to use.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2014.2302293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6720107","Risk;data mining;malware;mobile","Androids;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Google;Humanoid robots;Malware;Smart phones","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;risk management;smart phones","Android apps;machine learning techniques;malicious apps;mobile applications;risk communication mechanism;risk signal property;summary risk score generation","","0","","36","","2014-01-23","May-June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our approach learns an ellipsoidal boundary for normal data at each sensor, and introduces a method to cluster these ellipsoids at a global level in order to model normal behaviour in the network. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve greater accuracy in non-homogeneous sensing environments than existing methods, while achieving low communication and computational overhead in the network.","","978-1-4244-3517-3","978-1-4244-3518-0","10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416818","","Base stations;Computer science;Costs;Ellipsoids;Event detection;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Software engineering;Wireless sensor networks","distributed algorithms;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;clustering ellipsoids;distributed algorithm;wireless sensor networks","","8","","13","","","7-10 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose the notion of database response policies to support our intrusion response system tailored for a DBMS. Our interactive response policy language makes it very easy for the database administrators to specify appropriate response actions for different circumstances depending upon the nature of the anomalous request. The two main issues that we address in context of such response policies are that of policy matching, and policy administration. For the policy matching problem, we propose two algorithms that efficiently search the policy database for policies that match an anomalous request. We also extend the PostgreSQL DBMS with our policy matching mechanism, and report experimental results. The experimental evaluation shows that our techniques are very efficient. The other issue that we address is that of administration of response policies to prevent malicious modifications to policy objects from legitimate users. We propose a novel Joint Threshold Administration Model (JTAM) that is based on the principle of separation of duty. The key idea in JTAM is that a policy object is jointly administered by at least k database administrator (DBAs), that is, any modification made to a policy object will be invalid unless it has been authorized by at least k DBAs. We present design details of JTAM which is based on a cryptographic threshold signature scheme, and show how JTAM prevents malicious modifications to policy objects from authorized users. We also implement JTAM in the PostgreSQL DBMS, and report experimental results on the efficiency of our techniques.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560655","Databases;intrusion detection;policies;prevention;response;threshold signatures.","Authentication;Context;Databases;Engines;Organizations;Protocols","SQL;cryptography;digital signatures;relational databases","DBMS;PostgreSQL DBMS;cryptographic threshold signature scheme;database response policies;interactive response policy language;intrusion detection response system;joint threshold administration model;policy administration;policy matching problem;relational databases","","6","","26","","2010-09-02","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
