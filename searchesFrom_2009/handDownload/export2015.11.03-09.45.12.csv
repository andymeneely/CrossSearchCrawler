Thomas Friedman theorized that technology has leveled or “flattened” the global playing field that once existed. This flattening has happened as a result of what he calls the “triple convergence” of platform, process and people. However, there is a general lack of understanding about how to describe, assess the complex and dynamic nature of cyber security related information to improve overall cyber security task performance. Ever since the first computer virus traversed the Internet it has been apparent that attacks can spread rapidly across national boundaries.

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","1","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed scheme is based on using a wavelet based analysis of the received signal strength. We first develop a model to describe the changes in the received signal strength of a wireless station during a session hijack, while the received signal is embedded in colored noise caused by fading wireless channels. An optimal filter is then designed for the purpose of detection. We show that using a Wavelet Transform (WT), the colored noise with complex Power Spectral Density (PSD) in our case can be approximately whitened. Since a larger Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) increases the detection rate and decreases the false alarm rate, the SNR is maximized by analyzing the signal at specific frequency ranges. The detection mechanism is validated using both simulation and experimental results. The detector is shown to be reliable, computationally inexpensive and have minimal impact on the network performance.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2010.04.081447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5441359","Network security, intrusion detection.","Colored noise;Computational modeling;Fading;Filters;Frequency;Signal analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms;Wireless networks","safety systems;telecommunication security;time series;wavelet transforms;wireless channels","fading wireless channels;optimal filter;power spectral density;received signal strength;session hijacks;wavelet based analysis;wavelet transform;wireless networks","","1","","13","","","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In practice, attacks performed by such tools are signed and the interfaces between the target application and external resources are monitored (e.g., between services and a database server), allowing gathering additional information on existing vulnerabilities.

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6231-5","","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Asymmetric Concurrency;Computational Model;Intrusion Detection;Memory Observation","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data structures;Information security;Interference;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","computational model;concealment mechanism;concurrent observations;concurrent processing units;cost model;data structures;forced synchronization;interleaved linearization;malicious code;observation mechanism;privilege escalation;resource contention;second-order operation;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency","","2","","19","","","11-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network monitoring system detects anomalies such as attacks, states of hosts or services, resources. The aim of this is recognizes network faults and attacks quickly. A method widely used for almost network monitoring systems is setup agents on servers, network devices and then establishing connections between them and monitoring servers using some protocols such as ICMP and SNMP. These servers send periodic requests to agents to get reports or agents send traps to network monitoring servers. With this method, it must long time to alert. We propose a solution to fast detecting some anomalies such as servers or devices operate with high frequency (called “hot IPs”) and low frequency (called “low IPs”) and it works independently to early warning for these anomalies using non-adaptive group testing method. In particular, if dealing with up to 260,000 IPs, we can detect up to 31 hot and low IPs within 2.5 minutes.","","","","10.1109/ICTC.2013.6675536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675536","Group Testing;Hot IPs;Low IPs;Networking Anomaly","","IP networks;computer centres;computer network security;computerised monitoring;network servers;protocols","ICMP protocol;SNMP protocol;big data centers;discontinuous network reduction;error correction;hot-IP;low-IP;monitoring servers;network attacks;network device monitoring operation;network faults;network monitoring servers;network monitoring system;networking anomaly detection;nonadaptive group testing;server farms;server monitoring operation;setup agents","","2","","26","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have introduced a novel approach of multiple layered defenses to the application level attacks which possess higher detection ability with low false positive rate.

However, the security mechanism for WSNs has to be considered differently from traditional network. Firstly, there are severe constraints on WSNs devices such as minimal energy, computational and communicational capabilities. Secondly, there is an additional risk of physical attacks such as node capture and tampering. Moreover, cryptography based techniques alone are insufficient to secure WSNs. Hence, intrusion detection techniques must be designed and developed to detect the any kind of undesirable attacks. Further, these techniques should be lightweight because of resource-constrained nature of WSNs. Therefore, we present a new approach of robust and lightweight solution for detecting the sinkhole attack based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings of messages. The proposed solution needs collaboration of some extra monitor (EM) nodes apart from the ordinary nodes. We use values of RSSI from four EM nodes to determine the position of all sensor nodes where the base station (BS) is located at origin position (0,0). We use this information as weight from the BS in order to detect sinkhole attack. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is lightweight due to the monitor nodes were not loaded with any ordinary nodes or BS. Moreover, the proposed mechanism does not cause the communication overhead.","","978-4-907764-34-0","978-4-907764-33-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334764","detecting sinkhole attacks;intruder detection;security in wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power system security;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","RSSI;base station;communication system;extra monitor node;intrusion detection;node capture;physical attack;received signal strength indicator;security system;sinkhole attack detection;tampering;wireless sensor network","","0","","19","","","18-21 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

At present the presence of such a potential threat agitates a greater and greater interest in various possibilities for enhancing its security. Currently exerted defence system based on the use of firewall, antivirus software and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) represents a necessary minimum. This traditional approach to security of computer systems is primarily oriented to the defence against already existing threats. It is essential to adapt the security system to this trend as the current threats have much more aggressive forms. The use of decoy based security technology - Honeypot - represents an adequate form of defence. However, even this technology is not a “security panacea” as its 100% functionality is proportionally dependent on the specific installation process. This article is focused on the technology called Honeypot and the issue of implementation process of its autonomous version, which is able to create virtual Honeypots and thus rapidly increase a security level of distributed heterogeneous computer systems. The proposed autonomous Honeypot can be used in the educational process in computer security laboratories for demonstrating security, simulations of different types of attacks, as well as in monitoring, respectively in observation of behaviour of computer system during the attacks.","","978-1-4799-2161-4","","10.1109/ICETA.2013.6674409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6674409","","","Internet;computer aided instruction;computer science education;firewalls","IDS;IT;Internet;antivirus software;autonomous hybrid Honeypot technology;computer security laboratories;computer system security;decoy based security technology;distributed heterogeneous computer systems;education process;exerted defence system;firewall;information technology;intrusion detection system;programme weak points;security panacea;virtual Honeypots","","1","","14","","","24-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, protecting these networks from attacks and safeguarding the carried information against leaks is an ongoing research challenge, especially in combined scenarios where tactical data may flow across organizational boundaries. This paper presents a best-effort approach to Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) for inter-organizational RRS-based networks. The proposed architecture makes use of data mining techniques and an efficient n-dimensional clustering algorithm which has previously been successfully used for real-time anomaly detection in critical infrastructure protection. The DLP architecture is developed as an extension to the GTRS system, modeled and simulated in OPNET™ Modeler.

In cognitive radio networks, effect of these malicious users on network performance becomes more threatening, where they impersonate primary users by emitting similar signals, causing secondary users to vacate the occupied channel needlessly. As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is shown by calculating the throughput of the network and number of channel switches with respect to varying number of secondary and malicious nodes and by comparing it to an earlier proposed TCP protocol.","","978-1-4799-2293-2","","10.1109/FIT.2013.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717217","cognitive radio networks;cross layer design;security;transport layer protocol","Adaptation models;Cognitive radio;Hidden Markov models;Protocols;Throughput;Training;Wireless networks","access protocols;cognitive radio;computer network security;hidden Markov models;transport protocols;wireless channels","MAC layer;TCP protocol;channel switches;cognitive radio network;cross-layered approach;hidden Markov model;malicious node;open medium access;security threat;transport layer protocol;wireless channel;wireless network","","0","","23","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module.

Translating a newly discovered intrusion recognition criteria into a distributable rule can be a human intensive effort. This paper explores a multi-modal genetic algorithm solution for autonomous rule creation. This algorithm focuses on the process of creating rules once an intrusion has been identified, rather than the evolution of rules to provide a solution for intrusion detection. The algorithm was demonstrated on anomalous ICMP network packets (input) and Snort rules (output of the algorithm). Output rules were sorted according to a fitness value and any duplicates were removed. The experimental results on ten test cases demonstrated a 100 percent rule alert rate. Out of 33,804 test packets 3 produced false positives. Each test case produced a minimum of three rule variations that could be used as candidates for a production system.","","978-1-4244-9905-2","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949394","Computational intelligence;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection","Genetic algorithms;Humans;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Runtime;Syntactics","genetic algorithms;security of data","Snort rules;anomalous ICMP network packets;anomaly based network intrusion detection;autonomous rule creation;multi-modal genetic algorithm","","1","","16","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the existing key management schemes concentrate only on network structures and key allocation algorithms, ignoring attributes of the nodes themselves. Due to the distributed and dynamic nature of MANETs, it is possible to show that there is a security benefit to be attained when the node states are considered in the process of constructing a private key generator (PKG). In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical key management scheme in which nodes can get their keys updated either from their parent nodes or a threshold of sibling nodes. The proposed scheme can select the best nodes to be used as PGKs from all available ones considering their security conditions and energy states. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can decrease network compromising probability and increase network lifetime.","","978-1-4244-5238-5","978-1-4244-5239-2","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379731","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379731","","Computer network management;Computer networks;Cryptography;Engineering management;Identity management systems;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Research and development;Research and development management;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;cryptography;military communication;mobile communication;telecommunication network management","hierarchical identity based key management scheme;military applications;network lifetime;tactical mobile ad hoc networks","","1","","15","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Testbed provides effective ways to collect data representing the network and software operation. It facilitates secure time sharing of the hardware among different research projects.

A huge variety of malware typically spreads over the Internet, evolving every day, and challenging the research community and security practitioners to improve the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall ""network behavior"" of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored. A commercial IDS has been used to complement network data with alerts related to malicious activities. We use such alerts to trigger our processing system. Results shows that the richness of the Network Connectivity Graph provides a much more detailed picture of malicious activities, considerably enhancing our understanding.","","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288435","","IP networks;Itemsets;Malware;Monitoring;Protocols;Servers","Internet;graph theory;invasive software","Internet;Malware;malicious activities;malicious pattern;malicious traffic dissection;network behavior;network connectivity graph;network user privacy;network users security;research community;security practitioners","","","","","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives.

In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919","Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.","Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement","Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration","","3","","32","","2010-11-09","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, addressing such security requirements by implementing security measures is not a trivial task. Moreover, the creation and maintenance of the configuration for the security measures is prone to error. This research shows that it is possible to derive configuration file(s) to setup different security measures based on the input from system description files. In addition, we highlight an important anomaly in industrial control systems, namely the missing/tardiness of expected traffic. In this paper, we show how the proposed system works by taking IEC 61850 SCD files and generating configuration files for security measures such as firewall and IDS/IPS. Additionally, current IDS/IPS only raise an alert when unexpected traffic appears in the system. They do not alert on the disappearance of the expected traffic. In fact, this type of anomaly is as critical as the other type of anomaly. Thus, we address this anomaly as well in our research.","","978-1-4244-4178-5","","10.1109/THS.2009.5168079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5168079","control systems;intrusion detection;security","Communication system security;Computer industry;Data security;Detectors;IEC standards;Industrial control;Information security;Intrusion detection;Prototypes;Traffic control","industrial control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","IDS-IPS;IEC 61850 SCD file;anomaly detection;cyber security issue;industrial control system;missing traffic detector;system description file","","1","1","12","","","11-12 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we investigated the various proposed schemes for packet drop attack and present a remarkable comparison among them. Finally, we have proposed a solution based on Rank Based Data Routing (RBDR) record to identify malicious behaviour in network.

Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We motivate our work by discussing application scenarios that benefit from our scheme and suggest basic mechanisms for choosing appropriate curves.

It is common knowledge in the research community that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks.

We then map the evaluation of this accuracy problem to the traditional software verification and validation problem, which allows us to analyze the techniques academics have been using to evaluate their IDS technologies.

As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications. Our work is focused on exploring the resistance of various machine learning algorithms to such an approach. In this paper we present an experimental framework designed to measure the susceptibility of anomaly detection algorithms to model drift.

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.","","978-1-84919-909-4","","10.1049/cp.2014.1285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816","Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen","","cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique","","0","","","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience. According to the simulation results, our proposed mechanism achieved similar video quality level compared with standard FEC, while reducing the transmission of redundant packets, which will bring many benefits in a resource-constrained system.","2160-4886","978-1-4673-1429-9","","10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379150","Forward error correction;Intrusion detection;Multi-tier architecture;QoE;Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Cameras;Forward error correction;Multimedia communication;Quality assessment;Redundancy;Streaming media;Video recording","forward error correction;image sequences;multimedia communication;quality of experience;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;video coding;wireless sensor networks","QoE-aware FEC mechanism;camera nodes;forward error correction;multimedia content transmission;multimedia intrusion detection;multitier WMSN;multitier network architecture;multitier wireless multimedia sensor networks;quality of experience-aware FEC mechanism;real-time video sequences;redundant packets;reliability;resource-constrained system;scalar sensors;ubiquitous systems;video quality level","","3","","25","","","8-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to overcome the weaknesses and flaws of the existing MANET intrusion detection systems (IDSs), this architecture integrates an agent-based detection process. So, the main principle of the proposed architecture is based on: (a) the distribution which is achieved through the implementation of a local intrusion detection system on each network node, and (b) the cooperation that is guaranteed by mobile and stationary agents' collaboration. In that way we were able to have an IDS with so many interesting features such as: flexibility, distribution and cooperation, autonomy, lightweight, reactivity and fault tolerance which are extremely desired for any MANET intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-0798-7","","10.1109/ITNG.2012.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209126","distributed and cooperative;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;multi-agent system","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Multiagent systems","computer network security;groupware;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;multi-agent systems","IDS;MANET intrusion detection system;MASID;agent-based detection process;cooperative architecture;distributed architecture;fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile-stationary agent collaboration;multiagent system;network node","","1","","12","","","16-18 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the problems have been studied for many years and various solutions have been proposed, many security issues remain. To enhance the security and credibility of layer-2 network, we propose a trust-based spanning tree protocol aiming at achieving a higher credibility of LAN switch with a simple and lightweight authentication mechanism. If correctly implemented in each trusted switch, the authentication of trust-based STP can guarantee the credibility of topology information that is announced to other switch in the LAN. To verify the enforcement of the trusted protocol, we present a new credible evaluation method of the STP using a specification-based state model. We implement a prototype of trust-based STP to investigate its practicality. Experiment shows that the trusted protocol can achieve security goals and effectively avoid STP attacks with a lower computation overhead and good convergence performance.","","978-1-4799-4117-9","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2014.150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6969534","STP;credible evaluation;network security;trusted network","Authentication;Bridges;Network topology;Protocols;Switches;Topology","computer network security;formal specification;local area networks;message authentication;routing protocols;trees (mathematics)","LAN switch;authentication mechanism;link layer protocol;spanning tree protocol;specification-based state model;topology information;trust-based STP;trust-based security","","0","","14","","","19-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The established prototype can seamlessly feed the large-scale NetFlow data obtained from Cisco routers directly into the improved BBNN based IDS. The corresponding BBNN structure and parameter settings have been improved and experimentally tested. Experimental performance comparisons have been conducted against four major schemes of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes algorithm. The results show that the improved BBNN outperforms other algorithms with respect to the classification and detection performances.

A simple modification to the wireless MAC protocol is proposed to expose the presence of an adversary conducting a frame-relaying attack.
