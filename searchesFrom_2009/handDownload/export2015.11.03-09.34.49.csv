It is thus faced to not only the IP-networks security issues, but also to new issues which are related to the SIP protocol directly. In this paper, we present the most relevant SIP-related security vulnerabilities and threats; then, we discuss the different security mechanisms that can be deployed to overcome the SIP security issues while putting emphasis the most important ones.

An organization should find the methods to protect their data and network system to reduce the risk from attacks. Snort Intrusion Detection System (Snort-IDS) is a security tool of network security. It has been widely used for protecting the network of the organizations. The Snort-IDS utilize the rules to matching data packets traffic. If some packet matches the rules, Snort-IDS will generate the alert messages. However, Snort-IDS contain many rules and it also generates a lot of false alerts. In this paper, we present the procedure to improve the Snort-IDS rules for the network probe attack detection. In order to test the performance evaluation, we utilized the data set from the MIT-DAPRA 1999, which includes the normal and abnormal traffics. Firstly, we analyzed and explored the existing the Snort-IDS rules to improve the proposed Snort-IDS rules. Secondly, we applied the WireShark software to analyze data packets form of attack in data set. Finally, the Snort-IDS was improved, and it can detect the network probe attack. This paper, we had classified the attacks into several groups based on the nature of network probe attack. In addition, we also compared the efficacy of detection attacks between Snort-IDS rules to be updated with the Detection Scoring Truth. As the experimental results, the proposed Snort-IDS efficiently detected the network probe attacks compared to the Detection Scoring Truth. It can achieve higher accuracy. However, there were some detecting alert that occur over the attack in Detection Scoring Truth, because some attack occur in several time but the Detection Scoring Truth indentify as one time.","","","","10.1109/ICoICT.2014.6914042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914042","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Network Security;Network probe attack;Snort-IDS rule","Communication networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols","computer network security;data analysis","MIT-DAPRA;Snort intrusion detection system;Snort-IDS;WireShark software;abnormal traffics;alert messages;data packet analysis;data packet traffic matching;detection scoring truth;false alerts;network probe attack detection;network protection;network system security;normal traffics;performance evaluation","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.","","978-1-4577-0531-1","978-0-7695-4423-6","10.1109/SAINT.2011.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129","OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system","Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data","feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data","","3","","16","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A heterogeneous WSN model with distinct types of Gaussian distributed sensors is proposed, where both single-sensing detection and fe-sensing detection models are employed.

The majority of the research focuses on developing algorithms or signatures for detecting polymorphic and metamorphic payloads. However much of this problem has already been solved through the mainstream use of host based protection mechanisms e.g. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Randomization (ASLR). Many hackers are now using the more inventive attack methods e.g., return-to-libc, which do not inject shell code onto the stack and thus evade DEP and common shell code detection mechanisms. The purpose of this work is to propose a series of generic signatures that could be used to detect network born return-to-libc attacks.

We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets.

Majority of these failures occur because of the unforeseen faults that manifest themselves during the execution of the software. The contemporary trends in the software industry indicate dedicated efforts to minimize these unforeseen faults, thereby minimizing the chances of unforeseen failures. One of the definitive ways is to analyze the specifications thoroughly for the potential faults it may contain. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is one such approach that scans the specifications to identify potential failure modes and has been used successfully in many domains including software. In this paper, we propose an approach to generate test cases from UML activity diagram specifications by first transforming an activity diagram into a Software Success Tree (SST) and a Software Fault Tree (SFT). Subsequently, the SST and the SFT are then used to generate test cases for testing the normal and exceptional behavior of the system, respectively. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach using an illustrative example and compare its effectiveness with the other activity diagram based test case generation techniques.","1530-1362","978-1-4799-2143-0","","10.1109/APSEC.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6805406","UML;activity diagram;fault;model based testing;software fault tree;test cases","Analytical models;Fault trees;Logic gates;Software;Software algorithms;Testing;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;fault trees;formal specification;program testing;software fault tolerance","FTA;SFT;SST;UML activity diagram specification;fault tree analysis;safety validation test;software fault tree;software success tree;test case generation technique","","0","","28","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, major content providers are reluctant to use this technology because no solution to ensure the distribution of only legal contents is provided. In the same way, network operators do not really push towards P2P content distribution because bad organization of the overlay can lead to overload the network and consume a lot of networks resources. In this paper, a secure and legal network-aware P2P video system is introduced, which aims at overcoming those two drawbacks.

In this paper we analyzed VoIP architecture, both theoretically and practically with more emphasizes on security of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In order to analyze theoretically, we performed a literature survey related to SIP security and classified it in term of existing SIP attacks and defenses. Our theoretical analysis reveals that most attacks on VoIP architecture were successful due to weaknesses of SIP, especially the authentication mechanism used in the session establishment phase. For practical analysis, we used open source Asterisk and pen-test it in different attacking scenarios using Kali Linux distribution. Our practical analysis studies revealed that open source asterisk server is still vulnerable to several attacks, which includes eavesdropping, intentional interruption, social threats, interception and modification, and unintentional interruption. We also provide a concise mitigating scheme based on Single Sign-On (SSO), which provides an efficient and reliable authentication mechanism for securing SIP.","","978-1-4799-6088-0","","10.1109/ICET.2014.7021022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021022","Asterisk;PSTN;RTP;SIP;Security;VoIP","Authentication;Cryptography;Internet;Interrupters;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;telecommunication security","Kali Linux distribution;PSTN;SIP;VoIP;authentication mechanism;public switch telephone network;security analysis;session initiation protocol;voice over Internet protocol","","1","","33","","","8-9 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ONBIT test bed can be used to verify algorithms, concepts, and protocols, as well as discover more practical problems for future security research. This test bed is unique in its real-time nature and real-world performance and efficiency metrics, critical metrics for capabilities being readied for deployment. The ONBIT test bed was built using open source software and was designed to take accuracy and repeatability into consideration at each step of experimentation.

Their perceived success has led to the development of similar approaches in cyber security; information about previous attacks can be used to identify wider vulnerabilities and to inform future threat assessments. However, it can be difficult to integrate safety and security reporting within a single system. For example, in safety reporting systems the aim is often to disseminate lessons as widely as possible. In cyber security, there is a concern that this might motivate and inform further attacks. This paper identifies the challenges that arise in developing reporting schemes for security incidents in safety-critical applications. In particular we focus on the problems of implementing intrusion detection systems and coordinating forensic analysis without undermining system safety. These problems are exacerbated because existing cyber-security reporting guidelines focus more on office based systems than complex, command and control applications.","","978-1-84919-940-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111733","Cyber-Security;Forensics;Incident Reporting;Intrusion Detection Systems;Safety-Critical Systems","","digital forensics;safety-critical software","Cyber attack;Cyber-security incidents;coordinating forensic analysis;information vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;office based systems;reporting scheme;safety management systems;safety-critical systems;security incidents;threat assessment","","0","","","","","15-16 Oct. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

We have simulated in NS2 environment and shown the comparison of energy consumption or Residual energy of nodes having fixed transmission range with the proposed adaptive energy scheme. Adaptive energy scheme adjusts the range of transmission of each node based on the maximum distance between nodes in each cluster.

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults. In this work, a new monitoring technique using the CVA with UCLs derived from the estimated probability density function through kernel density estimations (KDEs) is proposed and applied to the simulated nonlinear Tennessee Eastman Process Plant. The proposed CVA with KDE approach is able to significantly improve the monitoring performance and detect faults earlier when compared to other methods also examined in this study.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2009.2032654","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290125","Canonical variate analysis (CVA);kernel density estimation (KDE);probability density function (PDF);process monitoring","","Gaussian distribution;fault diagnosis;principal component analysis;process monitoring","Gaussian assumption;Kernel density estimations;PCA;Tennessee Eastman Process Plant;canonical variate analysis;fault detection;industrial processes;nonlinear dynamic process monitoring;partial least squares;principal component analysis","","21","","19","","2009-10-20","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.","","","","10.1109/MOBS.2013.6614222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614222","Information security;Mobile Networks;Moving Target Defense","Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Servers","computer network security;mobile computing;radio networks","attack avoidance;attack detection;cloud services;critical nodes;heterogeneous moving target networks;mobile applications;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile node instability;mobile-enabled systems;network communication characteristics;network-layer moving target defense;peer registration servers;static node security;static nodes","","0","","11","","","25-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Code generation is a technique used to convert data structures or instruction to other forms to obtain greater benefits within execution environments. This study analyzes intrusion detection system (IDS) signatures and discovers character occurrence to be significantly uneven. Based on this property, this study designs a method to generate a string matching source code according to the state table of AC algorithm for embedded network intrusion detection platforms. The generated source code requires less memory and relies not only on table lookup, but also on the ability of processor. This method can upgrade the performance by compiling optimization and contribute to the application of network processors and DSP-like based platforms.

Data mining is to identify valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in massive data. It is demanding to apply data mining techniques to detect various intrusions. This paper presents an approach to detect intrusion based on data mining frame work. In the framework, intrusion detection is thought of as clustering. The reduction algorithm is presented to cancel the redundant attribute set and obtain the optimal attribute set to form the input of the FCM. To find the reasonable initial centers easily, the advanced FCM is established, which improves the performance of intrusion detection since the traffic is large and the types of attack are various. In the illustrative example, the number of attributes is reduced greatly and the detection is in a high precision for the attacks of DoS and Probe, a low false positive rate in all types of attacks.","","978-1-4244-5821-9","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497340","FCM;data mining;intrusion detection","Availability;Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Data engineering;Data mining;Information security;Intrusion detection;Probes","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data","DoS attack;FCM;Probe;data mining techniques;fuzzy c-means clustering;intrusion detection approach;optimal attribute set;reduction algorithm;redundant attribute set","","2","","18","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional anomaly detection systems, the system is trained with malicious rather than with benign network data. The system is suited for the load of large-scale networks and is less affected by typical problems of ordinary anomaly detection systems.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.","","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166574","agents;intrusion detection;networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Magnetic heads;Network topology;Prototypes;Topology","Internet;mobile agents;security of data","IDSs;Internet;PlanetLab;agent deployment;agent roaming pattern;central node;intelligent mobile agents;intrusion detection system;network size;network topology;virtual network","","0","","7","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first step is the polymorphic worms sample collection which is done by the Double-honeynet system. The second step is the signature generation for the collected samples which is done by k-means clustering algorithm and a Multilayer Perceptron Model. The system collects different types of polymorphic worms, we used the k-means clustering algorithm to separate each type into a cluster.

Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","10.1109/TST.2014.6787363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","","","","1","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Port scanning detection has received a lot of attention by researchers. However a slow port scan attack can deceive most of the existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this paper, we present a new, simple, and efficient method for detecting slow port scans. Our proposed method is mainly composed of two phases: (1) a feature collection phase that analyzes network traffic and extracts the features needed to classify a certain IP as malicious or not. (2) A classification phase that divides the IPs, based on the collected features, into three groups: normal IPs, suspicious IPs and scanner IPs. The IPs our approach classify as suspicious are kept for the next (K) time windows for further examination to decide whether they represent scanners or legitimate users. Hence, this approach is different than the traditional approach used by IDSs that classifies IPs as either legitimate or scanners, and thus producing a high number of false positives and false negatives. A small Local Area Network was put together to test our proposed method. The experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method in correctly identifying malicious scanners when both normal and slow port scan were performed using the three most common TCP port scanning techniques. Moreover, our method detects malicious scanners that are otherwise not detected using well known IDSs such as Snort.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122824","Intrusion Detection System;Port Scanning","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;IP networks;Probes;Security;Servers;Training data","local area networks;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IDS;TCP port scanning techniques;feature collection phase;intrusion detection systems;local area network;reconnaissance technique attackers;slow port scanning detection","","3","","20","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence of energy efficiency concerns, the exact combination of VMs running on a specific server will most likely change over time. We present experimental results how to use the energy/power consumption logs of a power monitored server as a side-channel that allows us to recognize the exact combination of VMs it currently hosts to a high degree. For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition. As a result, energy consumption data of servers must be protected carefully, as it is potentially valuable information for an attacker trying to track down a VM to mount further attack steps.","","978-1-4673-0006-3","","10.1109/DASC.2011.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119058","","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Power demand;Power measurement;Servers;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;power aware computing;virtual machines","Kolmogorov-Smirnov test;VM;cloud computing;data centers;energy consumption side channel attack;energy efficiency;energy/power consumption;hardware platform;power measurement device;power monitored server;virtual machines","","3","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Symposium on","20091228","2009","","","1","10","An emerging class of applications for enterprise wireless LANs (WLAN) is voice over IP (VoIP) applications, which impose a stringent requirement on end-to-end delay. Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device. As a result, the proposed architecture can automatically provide seamless network-layer handoff to a wide variety of mobile devices (such as PDA, portable, cell phone) running on different operating systems, as long as they are equipped with 802.11 network interface.","1526-7539","978-1-4244-4927-9","978-1-4244-4928-6","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366648","","Cellular phones;Delay;Frequency;Hardware;Internet telephony;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Network interfaces;Operating systems;Roaming;Wireless LAN","IP networks;Internet telephony;cellular radio;mobile computing;wireless LAN","Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture;IEEE 802.11 WLAN;PDA;cell phone;cellular networks;device-transparent network-layer handoff;enterprise wireless LAN;micromobility;mobile IP;mobile devices;voice over IP;wireless overlay network","","0","1","18","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accordingly, a variable data classification index has been defined and presented in this paper to classify stored data in cloud servers dynamically and increase the efficiency of this process. The suggested index uses three main parameters (Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, and Data Availability) and several sub-parameters to determine the value of this index dynamically according to the specifications of stored data.

In DPI, packet payload is compared against a large number of rules written in regular expression. To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination. SRD-DFA can be easily used with advanced DFA compression algorithms to achieve much less memory consumption.","","978-0-7695-3929-4","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380614","DFA;Minimization;Regular Expression","Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Explosions;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Power engineering and energy;Throughput","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA compression algorithms;L7-filter rule set;Snort rule set;advanced DFA compression algorithms;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;extended DFA structure;memory consumption;packet payload;subrule distinguishable DFA","","2","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, whether for selfish or malicious reasons, a node may fail to cooperate during the network operations or even attempt to disturb them, both of which have been recognized as misbehaviors. Various trust management schemes have been studied to assess the behaviors of nodes so as to detect and mitigate node misbehaviors inMANETs. Most of existing schemes model a node's trustworthiness along a single dimension, combining all of the available evidence to calculate a single, scalar trust metric. A single measure, however, may not be expressive enough to adequately describe a node's trustworthiness in many scenarios. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of MANET node from multiple perspectives.

Different types of observations are used to independently derive values for these three trust dimensions.

This paper proposes a Synchrophasor Specific Intrusion Detection System (SSIDS) for malicious cyber attacks and unintended misuse. The SSIDS involves a heterogeneous whitelist and behaviour-based approach to detect known and unknown attacks. The paper investigates and simulates reconnaissance, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks against a practical synchrophasor system that is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SSIDS detection tool. In contrast to previous research in this area that generally has investigated known attacks, this research actively considers the operational features of the IEEE C37.118 protocol and presents a more comprehensive and general solution to deal with not only known attacks but also unknown attacks.","","","978-1-84919-653-6","10.1049/cp.2013.0059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617502","Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Synchrophasor System","","computer network security;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;protocols;smart power grids","IEEE C37.118 protocol;SSIDS;SSIDS detection tool;behaviour-based approach;denial-of-service attacks;heterogeneous whitelist;malicious cyber attacks;man-in-the-middle attack;network security;smart grid control;smart grid monitoring;smart grid protection;synchrophasor specific intrusion detection system;synchrophasor systems;unintended misuse","","2","","","","","27-29 April 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Through deeply investigating the theory of control flow security, we develop the Control Flow Security Model (CFSM) which includes the formal definitions for program semantics and security properties for control flow. CFSM specifies that program execution dynamically follows only certain paths, in accordance with a statically declared security properties specified as Control Flow Constraint Specification (CFCS). We have proposed an efficient control flow security analysis algorithm for verifying that a particular control flow model satisfies the associated security properties. Our work contributes to bridging the gap between abstract specifications of control flow security properties and actual control flow security analysis for binary executables. The effectiveness and the practical usefulness of the approach are exemplified by an illustrative analysis of heap overflow vulnerability.","","978-1-4244-4519-6","978-1-4244-4520-2","10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234950","control flow security;formal method;security property;software analysis;software vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Data structures;Flow graphs;Optimizing compilers;Safety;Software performance","data flow analysis;data flow graphs;formal specification;program verification;programming language semantics;security of data","binary executable;control flow constraint specification;control flow security analysis approach;dynamic program execution;formal definition;program semantics","","1","","28","","","8-11 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SCADA process control systems are typically isolated from the internet via firewalls. However, they may still be subject to illicit cyber penetrations and may be subject to cyber threats from disgruntled insiders. We have developed a set of command injection, data injection, and denial of service attacks which leverage the lack of authentication in many common control system communication protocols including MODBUS, DNP3, and EtherNET/IP. We used these exploits to aid in development of a neural network based intrusion detection system which monitors control system physical behavior to detect artifacts of command and response injection attacks. Finally, we present intrusion detection accuracy results for our neural network based IDS which includes input features derived from physical properties of the control system.","2159-1237","978-1-4244-7760-9","","10.1109/ecrime.2010.5706699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706699","SCADA control system;cyber security;intrusion detection","Chemicals;Ethernet networks;IP networks;Monitoring;Protocols;Registers;Security","SCADA systems;authorisation;computer crime;critical infrastructures;neural nets","DNP3;EtherNET/IP;Internet;MODBUS;SCADA control system;control system communication protocol;critical infrastructure sector;cyber threat;data injection;denial of service attack;electricity generation;firewall;intrusion detection;neural network;oil and gas production;water distribution;water treatment","","15","","14","","","18-20 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the GPU-to-GPU case, we consider several refinements to a base GPU implementation and measure the performance gain from each refinement. For the host-to-host case, we analyze two strategies to communicate between the host and the GPU and show that one is optimal with respect to runtime while the other requires less device memory. This analysis is done for GPUs with one I/O channel to the host as well as those with 2. Experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU that has 240 cores running off of a Xeon 2.8 GHz quad-core host CPU show that, for the GPU-to-GPU case, our Aho-Corasick GPU adaptation achieves a speedup between 8.5 and 9.5 relative to a single-thread CPU implementation and between 2.4 and 3.2 relative to the best multithreaded implementation. For the host-to-host case, the GPU AC code achieves a speedup of 3.1 relative to a single-threaded CPU implementation. However, the GPU is unable to deliver any speedup relative to the best multithreaded code running on the quad-core host. In fact, the measured speedups for the latter case ranged between 0.74 and 0.83. Early versions of our multipattern Boyer-Moore adaptations ran 7 to 10 percent slower than corresponding versions of the AC adaptations and we did not refine the multipattern Boyer-Moore codes further.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165263","Aho-Corasick;CUDA;GPU;Multipattern string matching;multipattern Boyer-Moore","Arrays;Bandwidth;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Pattern matching","graphics processing units;multi-threading;pattern matching","Boyer-Moore adaptations;GPU AC code;GPU adaptations;GPU memory;GPU-to-GPU;I/O channel;NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU;device memory;host-to-host multipattern string matching;multipattern Boyer-Moore string matching algorithms;multithreaded implementation","","4","","39","","2012-03-06","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This sophisticated and evolving security threat puts all businesses at risk, no matter how big or small. Malware creates unique challenges to higher learning institutions (HLI) in protecting their information assets. This is largely due to the fact that HLI information technology (IT) departments must balance between enabling a highly collaborative, non-restrictive environment and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and computing resources. HLIs can proactively defend the network to reduce the risks associated with this threat by assessing the vulnerabilities and threats present in their networks and implementing appropriate multilayer security. A multilayer approach involves applying countermeasures at every layer of the computer network, from the perimeter routers and firewalls to users' personal computers in order to increase network security. The goal of this study is to propose a framework for network security protection against malware to increase the level of protection using non technical countermeasures.","","978-1-4244-5365-8","978-0-7695-3925-6","10.1109/ICCEE.2009.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380172","Higher Learning Instructions;component;malware;multilayered approach;network security;non-technical measures","Availability;Collaboration;Computer viruses;Data security;Horses;Information security;Information technology;Internet;Nonhomogeneous media;Protection","educational administrative data processing;educational institutions;invasive software","Internet-borne threat;higher learning institution;malware;multilayer security;security threat","","0","","15","","","28-30 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
