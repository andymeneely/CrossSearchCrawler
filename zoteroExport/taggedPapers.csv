Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to IDSs are expensive and slow. We describe a data mining framework for adaptively building Intrusion Detection (ID) models. The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models. We discuss the strengths of our data mining programs, namely, classification, meta-learning, association rules, and frequent episodes. We report on the results of applying these programs to the extensively gathered network audit data for the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program",1999,7/24/2014 17:08,7/24/2014 17:08,,120-132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,C:\Users\Ryan\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\hn6tel97.default\zotero\storage\23FU4ETI\abs_all.html; C:\Users\Ryan\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\hn6tel97.default\zotero\storage\4WR9P2XR\Lee et al. - 1999 - A data mining framework for building intrusion det.pdf,,DarpaIDE; false_positive_rate; num_features; true_positive_rate,1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program; anomaly detection; association rules; auditing; auditing programs; authorisation; Buildings; computer network management; Computer networks; Computer science; co-operative learning; data mining framework; Data security; Encoding; expert knowledge; Expert systems; frequent episodes; Gas detectors; host session; Identity-based encryption; IDS update; intrusion detection models; learning (artificial intelligence); manual encoding; meta detection model; meta-learning; misuse detection; multiple models; network connection; Protection; upgraded computing environments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 1999",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and Delayed Input DFAs (D2FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the Content Addressed Delayed Input DFA (CD2FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD2FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a ""content-less"" identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput. Specifically, we show that for an application using thousands of patterns defined by regular expressions, CD2FAs use as little as 10% of the space required by a conventional compressed DFA, and match the throughput of an uncompressed DFA.",2006,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:01,81–92,,,,,,,ANCS '06,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,Cisco_regex; memory_usage; num_states; num_transitions,deep packet inspection; DFA; regular expressions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we describe and evaluate experimentally a framework that may constitute the basis for a defacement detection service capable of monitoring thousands of remote Web sites systematically and automatically. In our framework an organization may join the service by simply providing the URLs of the resources to be monitored along with the contact point of an administrator. The monitored organization may thus take advantage of the service with just a few mouse clicks, without installing any software locally or changing its own daily operational processes. Our approach is based on anomaly detection and allows monitoring the integrity of many remote Web resources automatically while remaining fully decoupled from them, in particular, without requiring any prior knowledge about those resources. We evaluated our approach over a selection of dynamic resources and a set of publicly available defacements. The results are very satisfactory: all attacks are detected while keeping false positives to a minimum. We also assessed performance and scalability of our proposal and we found that it may indeed constitute the basis for actually deploying the proposed service on a large scale.",Oct-10,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:59,10:1–10:37,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,custom_test_data; false_negative_rate; false_positive_rate; max_resources,experimental evaluation; intrusion detection; monitoring service; Web site defacement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most high performance systems that perform deep packet inspection implement simple string matching algorithms to match packets against a large, but finite set of strings. owever, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power and flexibility. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) representations are typically used to implement regular expressions. However, DFA representations of regular expression sets arising in network applications require large amounts of memory, limiting their practical application.In this paper, we introduce a new representation for regular expressions, called the Delayed Input DFA (D2FA), which substantially reduces space equirements as compared to a DFA. A D2FA is constructed by transforming a DFA via incrementally replacing several transitions of the automaton with a single default transition. Our approach dramatically reduces the number of distinct transitions between states. For a collection of regular expressions drawn from current commercial and academic systems, a D2FA representation reduces transitions by more than 95%. Given the substantially reduced space equirements, we describe an efficient architecture that can perform deep packet inspection at multi-gigabit rates. Our architecture uses multiple on-chip memories in such a way that each remains uniformly occupied and accessed over a short duration, thus effectively distributing the load and enabling high throughput. Our architecture can provide ostffective packet content scanning at OC-192 rates with memory requirements that are consistent with current ASIC technology.",2006,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:09,339–350,,,,,,,SIGCOMM '06,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,Cisco_regex; default_length; num_distinct_transitions; num_duplicate_transitions; num_states; num_transitions,deep packet inspection; DFA; regular expressions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Network and traffic analysis can be done thanks to measurement devices or honeypots. However, analyzing the huge amount of gathered data, and characterizing the anomalies and attacks contained in these traces remain complex and time consuming tasks, done by network and security experts using poorly automatized tools, and are consequently slow and costly. In this paper, we present an unsupervised algorithm - called UNADA for Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detection Algorithm - for identification and characterization of security related anomalies and attacks occurring in honeypots. This automatized method does not need any attack signature database, learning phase, or labeled traffic. This corresponds to a major step towards autonomous security systems. This paper also shows how it is possible from anomalies characterization results to infer filtering rules that could serve for automatically configuring network routers, switches or firewalls. The performances of UNADA in terms of attacks identification accuracy are evaluated using honeypot traffic traces gathered on the honeypot network of the University of Maryland. The time latency for producing such accurate results are also presented, especially showing how the parallelization capabilities of the algorithm help reducing this latency.",2015,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:56,531–542,,,,,,,ASIA CCS '15,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,computational_time; custom_test_data; false_positive_rate; true_positive_rate,anomaly characterization; autonomous security systems; big traffic data; honeypot attack identification; unsupervised machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, techniques optimized for detection of fast scanning worms fail to detect slow scanning worms, and vice versa. In practice, there is interest in developing an integrated approach to detecting both classes of worms. In this paper, we propose and analyze a unique integrated detection approach capable of detecting and identifying traffic flow(s) responsible for simultaneous fast and slow scanning malicious worm attacks. The approach uses a combination of evidence from distributed host-based anomaly detectors, a self-adapting profiler and Bayesian inference from network heuristics to detect intrusion activity due to both fast and slow scanning worms. We assume that the extreme nature of fast scanning worm epidemics make them well suited for extreme value theory and use sample mean excess function to determine appropriate thresholds for detection of such worms. Random scanning worm behavior is considered in analyzing the stochastic time intervals that affect behavior of the detection technique. Based on the analysis, a probability model for worm detection interval using the detection scheme was developed.

Extending these tools to monitor parallel programs is challenging because the tools must account for inter-thread dependences and relaxed memory consistency models. Existing tools assume sequential consistency and often slow down the monitored program by orders of magnitude. In this paper, we present a novel approach that avoids these pitfalls by not relying on strong consistency models or detailed inter-thread dependence tracking. Instead, we only assume that events in the distant past on all threads have become visible; we make no assumptions on (and avoid the overheads of tracking) the relative ordering of more recent events on other threads. To overcome the potential state explosion of considering all the possible orderings among recent events, we adapt two techniques from static dataflow analysis, reaching definitions and reaching expressions, to this new domain of dynamic parallel monitoring. Significant modifications to these techniques are proposed to ensure the correctness and efficiency of our approach. We show how our adapted analysis can be used in two popular memory and security tools. We prove that our approach does not miss errors, and sacrifices precision only due to the lack of a relative ordering among recent events. Moreover, our simulation study on a collection of Splash-2 and Parsec 2.0 benchmarks running a memory-checking tool on a hardware-assisted logging platform demonstrates the potential benefits in trading off a very low false positive rate for (i) reduced overhead and (ii) the ability to run on relaxed consistency models.",2010,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:08,257–270,,,,,,Butterfly Analysis,ASPLOS XV,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,computational_time; custom_test_data; precision,data flow analysis; dynamic program monitoring; parallel programming; static analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the need of tailored Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for the smart grid, very limited progress has been made in this area. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its own unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, that restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. We show that smart grid exhibits deterministic and predictable behavior that can be accurately modeled to develop intrusion detection system. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. Event logs are modeled using fourth order Markov Chain and specifications are written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The approach provides robustness against evasion and mimicry attacks, however, we discuss that it still can be evaded to a certain extent.

For these cases, it is necessary to use some mechanism of intrusion detection. Besides preventing the intruder from causing damages to the network, the intrusion detection system (IDS) can acquire information related to the attack techniques, helping in the development of prevention systems.

The analysis is performed using a number of attack models (or signatures) that are matched against a specific event stream. Intrusion detection systems may operate in heterogeneous environments, analyzing different types of event streams. Currently, intrusion detection systems and the corresponding attack modeling languages are developed following an ad hoc approach to match the characteristics of specific target environments. As the number of systems that have to be protected increases, this approach results in increased development effort. To overcome this limitation, we developed a framework, called STAT, that supports the development of new intrusion detection functionality in a modular fashion. The STAT framework can be extended following a well-defined process to implement intrusion detection systems tailored to specific environments, platforms, and event streams. The STAT framework is novel in the fact that the extension process also includes the extension of the attack modeling language. The resulting intrusion detection systems represent a software family whose members share common attack modeling features and the ability to reconfigure their behavior dynamically.",2003,7/25/2014 19:29,7/25/2014 19:29,7/25/2014 19:29,88–97,,,,,,,ESEC/FSE-11,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,C:\Users\Ryan\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\hn6tel97.default\zotero\storage\SNHXGJ5D\Vigna et al. - 2003 - Designing and Implementing a Family of Intrusion D.pdf,,loc; MIT_LL,intrusion detection; object-oriented frameworks; program families; security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These features limit the feasibility of the deployment of contemporary Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): centralized systems fail because there is no strict network boundary, and distributed and/or cooperative systems challenge the limited resources of the nodes. As a result, practical IDSs for WMNs are scarce, and existing systems are limited with respect to detection capabilities. In this paper we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of ""DogoIDS"": an open source, mobile, active-probing-based intrusion detection system. Exploiting mobility allows to mitigate the limitations of distributed, node-dependent systems. The active nature of the system achieves detection capabilities beyond that of a purely passive system.

In contrast, the dynamic analysis of JavaScript code at run-time has proven to be effective in identifying malicious behavior. During the execution of the code, however, damage may already take place and thus an early detection is critical for effective protection. In this paper, we introduce EarlyBird: a detection method optimized for early identification of malicious behavior in JavaScript code.

While being highly efficient, they tend to suffer from a high false-positive rate. We develop the concept of contextual signatures as an improvement of string-based signature-matching. Rather than matching fixed strings in isolation, we augment the matching process with additional context. When designing an efficient signature engine for the NIDS bro, we provide low-level context by using regular expressions for matching, and high-level context by taking advantage of the semantic information made available by bro's protocol analysis and scripting language. Therewith, we greatly enhance the signature's expressiveness and hence the ability to reduce false positives. We present several examples such as matching requests with replies, using knowledge of the environment, defining dependencies between signatures to model step-wise attacks, and recognizing exploit scans.To leverage existing efforts, we convert the comprehensive signature set of the popular freeware NIDS snort into bro's language. While this does not provide us with improved signatures by itself, we reap an established base to build upon.

Cisco's NetFlow is a widely deployed flow measurement solution that uses a configurable static sampling rate to control processor and memory usage on the router and the amount of reporting flow records generated. But during flooding attacks the memory and network bandwidth consumed by flow records can increase beyond what is available. Currently available countermeasures have their own problems: 1) reject new flows when the cache is full--some legitimate new flows will not be counted; 2) export not-terminated flows to make room for new ones--this will exhaust the export bandwidth; and 3) adapt the sampling rate to traffic rate--this will reduce the overall accuracy of accounting, including legitimate flows. In this paper, we propose an entropy based adaptive flow aggregation algorithm. Relying on information-theoretic techniques, the algorithm efficiently identifies the clusters of attack flows in real time and aggregates those large number of short attack flows into a few metaflows. Compared to currently available solutions, our solution not only alleviates the problem in memory and export bandwidth, but also significantly improves the accuracy of legitimate flows.

Previous hardware proposals either focus on mechanisms that target specific bugs or address only the cost of binary instrumentation. In this paper, we propose a flexible hardware solution for accelerating a wide range of instruction-grain monitoring tools. By examining a number of diverse tools (for memory checking, security tracking, and data race detection), we identify three significant common sources of overheads and then propose three novel hardware techniques for addressing these overheads: Inheritance Tracking, Idempotent Filters, and Metadata-TLBs.

However as the network grows, secured information communication has become more vulnerable due to threats from unknown sources and hence the need for secured information sharing assumes greater importance in the present scenario. Various types of threats can be monitored by designing effective intrusion detection systems for providing security to the network. In this paper we have proposed a new frame work based on a hybrid intrusion detection system for known and unknown attacks in an efficient way. This frame work has the ability to detect intrusion in real time environment from the link layer. This has been achieved by combining rule base with appropriate clustering techniques for both supervised and unsupervised data. The known attack patterns are identified, with misuse detection system, using the rule base and, with anomaly detection, new attacks are identified by deploying clustering techniques. The new attacks have been updated in the rule base with the knowledge from an expert database that improved the efficiency of the system. The detection rate of the hybrid system has been found to increase as the unknown attack percentage increases whereas in misuse, detection rate is found to decrease and in anomaly detection rate remains constant.",2012,7/25/2014 19:39,7/25/2014 19:39,7/25/2014 19:39,47–51,,,,,,,CCSEIT '12,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,C:\Users\Ryan\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\hn6tel97.default\zotero\storage\M4J2KS5H\Aneetha et al. - 2012 - Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System Using Ex.pdf,,KDD99; true_positive_rate,anomaly detection; clustering techniques; expert rule base; hybrid intrusion detection system; misuse detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, more advanced malware has introduced mechanisms to avoid detection in these views by using obfuscation techniques to avoid static detection and execution-stalling techniques to avoid dynamic detection. In this paper we construct a classification framework that is able to incorporate both static and dynamic views into a unified framework in the hopes that, while a malicious executable can disguise itself in some views, disguising itself in every view while maintaining malicious intent will prove to be substantially more difficult. Our method uses kernels to place a similarity metric on each distinct view and then employs multiple kernel learning to find a weighted combination of the data sources which yields the best classification accuracy in a support vector machine classifier. Our approach opens up new avenues of malware research which will allow the research community to elegantly look at multiple facets of malware simultaneously, and which can easily be extended to integrate any new data sources that may become popular in the future.",2012,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:58,3–14,,,,,,Improving Malware Classification,AISec '12,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2381900&type=pdf,accuracy; auc; computational_time; false_positive_rate,computer security; machine learning; malware; multiple kernel learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This impedes the detection ability of the system and leads to missed attacks. In this work we present selective packet discarding, a best effort approach that enables the NIDS to anticipate overload conditions and minimize their impact on attack detection. Instead of letting the packet capturing subsystem randomly drop arriving packets, the NIDS proactively discards packets that are less likely to affect its detection accuracy, and focuses on the traffic at the early stages of each network flow. We present the design of selective packet discarding and its implementation in Snort NIDS. Our experiments show that selective packet discarding significantly improves the detection accuracy of Snort under increased traffic load, allowing it to detect attacks that would have otherwise been missed.",2010,7/25/2014 19:56,7/25/2014 19:56,7/25/2014 19:56,15–21,,,,,,,EUROSEC '10,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,C:\Users\Ryan\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\hn6tel97.default\zotero\storage\NBVXIS8I\Papadogiannakis et al. - 2010 - Improving the Accuracy of Network Intrusion Detect.pdf,,CPU_usage; packets_dropped; processing_bandwidth; throughput; true_positive_rate,intrusion detection; overload control; selective packet discarding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests that in a network, intrusion attempts may be detected by looking for communication that does not respect community boundaries. In this paper, we examine the utility of this concept for identifying malicious network sources. In particular, our goal is to explore whether this concept allows a core-network operator using flow data to augment signature-based systems located at network edges. We show that simple measures of communities can be defined for flow data that allow a remarkably effective level of intrusion detection simply by looking for flows that do not respect those communities. We validate our approach using labeled intrusion attempt data collected at a large number of edge networks.

Network Intrusion Detection Systems are used to detect the intrusions in the network. For efficient Network Intrusion Detection System the preprocessing is most essential. In order to preprocess the dataset Support Vector Machine algorithm is used and that gives the new data model which has been used for creating rules for misuse detection. The dataset can be classified into two datasets; namely positive kernel and negative kernel. Positive Kernel is used for creating the rules. After classifying the dataset, fuzzification is applied to that datset and then the rules has been created by Genetic Network Programming which based on direct graph structure. In the testing phase the system has been used to detect the misuse activities.
