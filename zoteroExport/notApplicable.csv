However, wireless ad hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to extern and insider attacks due to their very intrinsic nature such as shared wireless medium and decentralized architecture. In this paper, we present a distributed intrusion detection approach, which is based on exchange of events and cooperation between the participating nodes. The proposed mechanism relies on non-intrusive traffic monitoring at each node, which generates network events. These events are processed by the intrusion detection system that is able to instantly signalize malicious activities, for instance, a node disseminating fake routing information through the network. We demonstrate the approach efficiency for detecting misbehaving nodes through a virtualized network environment that consists of virtual nodes interconnected which represent the network topology.",2012,7/25/2014 19:55,7/25/2014 19:55,7/25/2014 19:55,556–562,,,,,,,SAC '12,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,C:\Users\Ryan\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\hn6tel97.default\zotero\storage\XM57N4XK\Morais and Cavalli - 2012 - A Distributed Intrusion Detection Scheme for Wirel.pdf,,network,intrusion detection; routing misbehavior; wireless ad hoc network,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data,,1556-4681,10.1145/2700394,http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2700394,"A cyber-physical system (CPS) integrates physical (i.e., sensor) devices with cyber (i.e., informational) components to form a context-sensitive system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in real-world situations. The CPS has wide applications in scenarios such as environment monitoring, battlefield surveillance, and traffic control. One key research problem of CPS is called mining lines in the sand. With a large number of sensors (sand) deployed in a designated area, the CPS is required to discover all trajectories (lines) of passing intruders in real time. There are two crucial challenges that need to be addressed: (1) the collected sensor data are not trustworthy, and (2) the intruders do not send out any identification information. The system needs to distinguish multiple intruders and track their movements. This study proposes a method called LiSM (Line-in-the-Sand Miner) to discover trajectories from untrustworthy sensor data. LiSM constructs a watching network from sensor data and computes the locations of intruder appearances based on the link information of the network. The system retrieves a cone model from the historical trajectories to track multiple intruders. Finally, the system validates the mining results and updates sensors’ reliability scores in a feedback process. In addition, LoRM (Line-on-the-Road Miner) is proposed for trajectory discovery on road networks—mining lines on the roads. LoRM employs a filtering-and-refinement framework to reduce the distance computational overhead on road networks and uses a shortest-path-measure to track intruders. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on big datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in trajectory mining tasks.",Feb-15,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:11,16:1–16:35,,3,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,Cyber-physical system; sensor network; trajectory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, such websites are either developed separately from their associated desktop-oriented version, or both versions are created simultaneously by employing methodologies that support multi-platform context-aware websites, requiring an extensive engineering effort. While these approaches provide a solution for developing new websites, they go past the plethora of existing websites. To address this issue, we present an approach for enhancing existing websites on-the-fly with context-aware features. We first discuss the requirements for such an adaptation process, and identify applicable adaptation methods to realize context-aware features.

We view a time series as observed data from an underlying dynamical system. In this way, analyzing multimodal time series can be viewed as finding latent structures from dynamical systems. In light this, our approach is based on the concept of generating partition which is the theoretically best symbolization of time series maximizing the information of the underlying original continuous dynamical system. However, generating partition is difficult to achieve for time series without explicit dynamical equations. Different from most previous approaches that attempt to approximate generating partition through various deterministic symbolization processes, our algorithm maintains and estimates a probabilistic distribution over a symbol set for each data point in a time series. To do so, we develop a Bayesian framework for probabilistic symbolization and demonstrate that the approach can be successfully applied to both simulated data and empirical data from multimodal agent-agent interactions. We suggest this unsupervised learning algorithm has a potential to be used in various multimodal datasets as first steps to identify underlying structures between temporal variables.",2010,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:02,53:1–53:8,,,,,,,ICMI-MLMI '10,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,generating partition; multi-agent communication; multi-stream time series; symbol dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAF uses simple time series forecasting models to predict sensor readings. The idea is to build these local models at each node, transmit them to the root of the network (the ""sink""), and use them to approximately answer user queries. Our approach dramatically reduces communication relative to previous approaches for querying sensor networks by exploiting properties of these local models, since each sensor communicates with the sink only when its local model varies due to changes in the underlying data distribution. In our experimental results performed on a trace of real data, we observed on average about 150 message transmissions from each sensor over a week (including the learning phase) to correctly predict temperatures to within +/- 0.5°C.SAF also provides a mechanism to detect data similarities between nodes and organize nodes into clusters at the sink at no additional communication cost. This is again achieved by exploiting properties of our local time series models, and by means of a novel definition of data similarity between nodes that is based not on raw data but on the prediction values. Our clustering algorithm is both very efficient and provably optimal in the number of clusters. Our clusters have several interesting features: first, they can capture similarity between far away nodes that are not geographically adjacent; second, cluster membership to variations in sensors' local models; third, nodes within a cluster are not required to track the membership of other nodes in the cluster. We present a number of simulation-based experimental results that demonstrate these properties of SAF.",2006,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:53,191–300,,,,,,,MSWiM '06,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,data collection; data stream; energy; models; query; sensor networks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we have proposed a model for analyzing and detecting anomalous events based on user behavior analysis through usage patterns, user profiles and session management. After monitoring the events in the system, if any intrusion activity occurs, then alerts are issued to system administrators. Since a user profile is not necessarily fixed but rather it evolves with changing time, so a dynamic user behavior modeling is represented as a sequence of events and combination of fact and dimension tables accessed by the users.

Even if the location and nature of hard errors are known a priori, either at manufacture-time or in the field, cores with such errors must be disabled in the absence of hard-error tolerance. While caches, with their regular and repetitive structures, are easily covered against hard errors by providing spare arrays or spare lines, structures within a core are neither as regular nor as repetitive. Previous work has proposed microarchitectural core salvaging to exploit structural redundancy within a core and maintain functionality in the presence of hard errors. Unfortunately microarchitectural salvaging introduces complexity and may provide only limited coverage of core area against hard errors due to a lack of natural redundancy in the core. This paper makes a case for architectural core salvaging. We observe that even if some individual cores cannot execute certain operations, a CPU die can be instruction-set-architecture (ISA) compliant, that is execute all of the instructions required by its ISA, by exploiting natural cross-core redundancy. We propose using hardware to migrate offending threads to another core that can execute the operation. Architectural core salvaging can cover a large core area against faults, and be implemented by leveraging known techniques that minimize changes to the microarchitecture. We show it is possible to optimize architectural core salvaging such that the performance on a faulty die approaches that of a fault-free die--assuring significantly better performance than core disabling for many workloads and no worse performance than core disabling for the remainder.",2009,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:15,93–104,,,,,,,ISCA '09,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,core salvaging; hard errors; redundancy; reliability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we investigate ways to analyze collections of malicious probing traffic in order to understand the significance of large-scale ""botnet probes"". In such events, an entire collection of remote hosts together probes the address space monitored by a sensor in some sort of coordinated fashion. Our goal is to develop methodologies by which sites receiving such probes can infer---using purely local observation---information about the probing activity: What scanning strategies does the probing employ? Is this an attack that specifically targets the site, or is the site only incidentally probed as part of a larger, indiscriminant attack? Our analysis draws upon extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including properties such as trend, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. In addition, we design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) as inferred from the limited local view of a honeynet. Cross-validating with data from DShield shows that our inferences exhibit promising accuracy.",2009,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:06,11–22,,,,,,,ASIACCS '09,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,botnet; global property extrapolation; honeynet; scan strategy inference; situational awareness; statistical inference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their aim is to detect misbehaving or faulty nodes in order to take appropriate countermeasures, thus limiting the damage caused by adversaries as well as by hard or software faults. So far, however, once detected, misbehaving nodes have just been isolated from the rest of the sensor network and hence are no longer usable by running applications. In the presence of an adversary or software faults, this proceeding will inevitably lead to an early and complete loss of the whole network.For this reason, we propose to no longer expel misbehaving nodes, but to recover them into normal operation. In this paper, we address this problem and present a formal specification of what is considered a secure and correct node recovery algorithm together with a distributed algorithm that meets these properties. We discuss its requirements on the soft- and hardware of a node and show how they can be fulfilled with current and upcoming technologies. The algorithm is evaluated analytically as well as by means of extensive simulations, and the findings are compared to the outcome of a real implementation for the BTnode sensor platform. The results show that recovering sensor nodes is an expensive, though feasible and worthwhile task. Moreover, the proposed program code update algorithm is not only secure but also fair and robust.",2006,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:06,113–122,,,,,,,SASN '06,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,intrusion detection; node recovery; sensor networks; wireless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, phish detection methods either use human-verified URL blacklists or exploit Web page features via machine learning techniques. However, the former is frail in terms of new phish, and the latter suffers from the scarcity of effective features and the high false positive rate (FP). To alleviate those problems, we propose a layered anti-phishing solution that aims at (1) exploiting the expressiveness of a rich set of features with machine learning to achieve a high true positive rate (TP) on novel phish, and (2) limiting the FP to a low level via filtering algorithms. Specifically, we proposed CANTINA+, the most comprehensive feature-based approach in the literature including eight novel features, which exploits the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), search engines and third party services with machine learning techniques to detect phish. Moreover, we designed two filters to help reduce FP and achieve runtime speedup. The first is a near-duplicate phish detector that uses hashing to catch highly similar phish. The second is a login form filter, which directly classifies Web pages with no identified login form as legitimate. We extensively evaluated CANTINA+ with two methods on a diverse spectrum of corpora with 8118 phish and 4883 legitimate Web pages. In the randomized evaluation, CANTINA+ achieved over 92% TP on unique testing phish and over 99% TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 0.4% FP with 10% training phish. In the time-based evaluation, CANTINA+ also achieved over 92% TP on unique testing phish, over 99% TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 1.4% FP under 20% training phish with a two-week sliding window. Capable of achieving 0.4% FP and over 92% TP, our CANTINA+ has been demonstrated to be a competitive anti-phishing solution.",Sep-11,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:09,21:1–21:28,,2,14,,,CANTINA+,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,Anti-phishing; information retrieval; machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These attacks are based on the blind source separation algorithms widely used to recover individual signals from mixtures of signals in statistical signal processing. Since the philosophy behind the design of current anonymity networks is to mix traffic or to hide in crowds, the proposed anonymity attacks are very effective. The flow separation attack proposed for wired anonymity networks can separate the traffic in a mix network. Our experiments show that this attack is effective and scalable. By combining the flow separation method with frequency spectrum matching, a passive attacker can derive the traffic map of the mix network. We use a nontrivial network to show that the combined attack works. The proposed anonymity attacks for wireless networks can identify nodes in fully anonymized wireless networks using collections of very simple sensors. Based on a time series of counts of anonymous packets provided by the sensors, we estimate the number of nodes with the use of principal component analysis. We then proceed to separate the collected packet data into traffic flows that, with help of the spatial diversity in the available sensors, can be used to estimate the location of the wireless nodes. Our simulation experiments indicate that the estimators show high accuracy and high confidence for anonymized TCP traffic. Additional experiments indicate that the estimators perform very well in anonymous wireless networks that use traffic padding.",Nov-09,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:10,8:1–8:31,,1,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,Anonymous communication; blind source separation; location privacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we analyze Conficker infections at a large scale, including about 25 millions victims, and study various interesting aspects about this state-of-the-art malware. By analyzing Conficker, we intend to understand current and new trends in malware propagation, which could be very helpful in predicting future malware trends and providing insights for future malware defense. We observe that Conficker has some very different victim distribution patterns compared to many previous generation worms/botnets, suggesting that new malware spreading models and defense strategies are likely needed. Furthermore, we intend to determine how well a reputation-based blacklisting approach can perform when faced with new malware threats such as Conficker. We cross-check several DNS blacklists and IP/AS reputation data from Dshield [6] and FIRE [7], and our evaluation shows that unlike a previous study [18] which shows that a blacklist-based approach can detect most bots, these reputation-based approaches did relatively poorly for Conficker. This raised the question, how can we improve and complement existing reputation-based techniques to prepare for future malware defense? Finally, we look into some insights for defenders. We show that neighborhood watch is a surprisingly effective approach in the Conficker case. This suggests that security alert sharing/correlation (particularly among neighborhood networks) could be a promising approach and play a more important role for future malware defense.",2010,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:59,151–160,,,,,,Conficker and Beyond,ACSAC '10,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its main purpose is to identify potentially intrusive events and alert the security personnel to the danger. A typical intrusion detection system, however, is known to be imperfect in detection of intrusive events, resulting in high false-alarm rates. Nevertheless, current intrusion detection models unreasonably assume that upon alerts raised by a system, an information security officer responds to all alarms without any delay and avoids damages of hostile activities. This assumption of responding to all alarms with no time lag is often impracticable. As a result, the benefit of an intrusion detection system can be overestimated by current intrusion detection models. In this article, we extend previous models by including an information security officer's alarm inspection under a constraint as a part of the process in determining the optimal intrusion detection policy. Given a potentially hostile environment for a firm, in which the intrusion rates and costs associated with intrusion and security officers' inspection can be estimated, we outline a framework to establish the optimal operating points for intrusion detection systems under security officers' inspection constraint. The optimal solution to the model will provide not only a basis of better evaluation of intrusion detection systems but also useful insights into operations of intrusion detection systems.

It takes user-written, potentially system-specific checkers and uses them to drive a storage system into tricky corner cases, including crash recovery errors. EXPLODE uses a novel adaptation of ideas from model checking, a comprehensive, heavy-weight formal verification technique, that makes its checking more systematic (and hopefully more effective) than a pure testing approach while being just as lightweight.

Our results include: The number of copies of an H with an independent set of size s can be computed exactly in O*(2s nk-s+3) time. A minimum weight copy of such an H (with arbitrary real weights on nodes and edges) can be found in O(4s+o(s) nk-s+3) time. (The O* notation omits (k) factors.) These algorithms rely on fast algorithms for computing the permanent of a k x n matrix, over rings and semirings. The number of copies of any H having minimum (or maximum) node-weight (with arbitrary real weights on nodes) can be found in O(n? k/3 + n2k/3+o(1)) time, where ? < 2.4 is the matrix multiplication exponent and k is divisible by 3. Similar results hold for other values of k. Also, the number of copies having exactly a prescribed weight can be found within this time. These algorithms extend the technique of Czumaj and Lingas (SODA 2007) and give a new (algorithmic) application of multiparty communication complexity. Finding an edge-weighted triangle of weight exactly 0 in general graphs requires ?(n2.5-?) time for all ? > 0, unless the 3SUM problem on N numbers can be solved in O(N2 - ?) time.

Yet for a variety of reasons, specialized hardware functions for high assurance processing are seldom (i.e., a couple of features per vendor over twenty years) integrated into these commodity processors, despite a small flurry of late (e.g., ARM TrustZone, Intel VT-x/VT-d and AMD-V/AMD-Vi, Intel TXT and AMD SVM, and Intel AES-NI). Furthermore, as chips increase in complexity, trustworthy processing of sensitive information can become increasingly difficult to achieve due to extensive on-chip resource sharing and the lack of corresponding protection mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce a method to enhance the security of commodity integrated circuits, using minor modifications, in conjunction with a separate integrated circuit that can provide monitoring, access control, and other useful security functions. We introduce a new architecture using a separate control plane, stacked using 3D integration, that allows for the function and economics of specialized security mechanisms, not available from a co-processor alone, to be integrated with the underlying commodity computing hardware. We first describe a general methodology to modify the host computation plane by attaching an optional control plane using 3-D integration. In a developed example we show how this approach can increase system trustworthiness, through mitigating the cache-based side channel problem by routing signals from the computation plane through a cache monitor in the 3-D control plane. We show that the overhead of our example application, in terms of area, delay and performance impact, is negligible.",2010,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:17,199–210,,,,,,,ACSAC '10,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially in cloud computing, where virtual servers with various pre-installed software packages are leased, selecting optimized security settings is very difficult. In particular, optimized security settings are not identical in every setup. They depend on characteristics of the setup, on the ways an application is used or on other applications running on the same system. Configuring optimized settings given these interdependencies is a complex and time-consuming task. In this work, we present an autonomous agent which improves security settings of applications which run in virtual servers. The agent retrieves custom-made security settings for a target application by investigating its specific setup, it tests and transparently changes settings via introspection techniques unbeknownst from the perspective of the virtual server. During setting selection, the application's operation is not disturbed nor any user interaction is needed. Since optimal settings can change over time or they can change depending on different tasks the application handles, the agent can continuously adapt settings as well as improve them periodically.

Most extensions are benign and represent a convenient approach for extending the kernel functionality and allowing a system to communicate with an increasing number of I/O devices. A small fraction of them are malicious and, as they run in kernel space, pose a threat to kernel integrity. From a security viewpoint this situation is paradoxical: modern OSes depend and must co-live with untrustworthy but needed extensions. Our immune system faces the same challenge: our body is made of a large number of bacteria, which are mostly benign and also carry out critical functions for our physiology. However, a small fraction of them pose a threat to our body as they can cause pathologies. The immune system maintains an homeostatic relationship with its microbiota by minimizing contact between bacteria and cell surfaces and confining bacteria to certain sites. Challenging the current trend that advocates leveraging only a hypervisor to defend the kernel (for considering it too vulnerable to defend itself), this paper advocates that modern OSes, like our immune system, should play an active role in maintaining healthy and safe interactions with their extensions. This work presents Ianus, a proof-of-concept prototype for this paradigm using Linux and the Bochs x86 emulator, which successfully minimized kernel extensions interactions with original kernel. Its security was evaluated with real rootkits and benign modules. Ianus' performance was analyzed with system and CPU benchmarks and it caused an small overhead to the system (approximately 12%).",2014,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:11,1672–1679,,,,,,Ianus,SAC '14,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,Collaboration; Immune system; introspection; semantic gap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim is to prevent or modify inappropriate behaviour caused by e.g. malicious injected scripts or poorly designed third-party code. The approach is based on modifying the code so as to make it self-protecting: the protection mechanism (security policy) is embedded into the code itself and intercepts security relevant API calls. The challenges come from the nature of the JavaScript language: any variables in the scope of the program can be redefined, and code can be created and run on-the-fly. This creates potential problems, respectively, for tamper-proofing the protection mechanism, and for ensuring that no security relevant events bypass the protection. Unlike previous approaches to instrument and monitor JavaScript to enforce or adjust behaviour, the solution we propose is lightweight in that (i) it does not require a modified browser, and (ii) it does not require any run-time parsing and transformation of code (including dynamically generated code). As a result, the method has low run-time overhead compared to other methods satisfying (i), and the lack of need for browser modifications means that the policy can even be applied on the server to mitigate some effects of cross-site scripting bugs.",2009,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:08,47–60,,,,,,,ASIACCS '09,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1533067&type=pdf,,inlined reference monitors; javascript; language based security; Programming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Merlin compiler maps these policies into a constraint problem that determines bandwidth allocations using parameterizable heuristics. It then generates code that can be executed on the network elements to enforce the policies. To allow network tenants to dynamically adapt policies to their needs, Merlin provides mechanisms for delegating control of sub-policies and for verifying that modifications made to sub-policies do not violate global constraints.

To process stream-based data in an application-independent manner, distributed stream processing systems emerged. They typically translate a query to an operator graph, place the operators to stream processing nodes, and execute them to process the streamed data. The operator placement is crucial in such systems, as it deeply influences query execution. Often, different stream-based applications require dedicated placement of query graphs according to their specific objectives, e.g. bandwidth not less than 500 MBit/s and costs not more that 1 cost unit. This fact constraints operator placement. Existing approaches do not take into account application-specific objectives, thus not reflecting application-specific placement decisions. As objectives might conflict among each other, operator placement is subject to delicate trade-offs, such as bandwidth maximization is more important than cost reduction. Thus, the challenge is to find a solution which considers the application-specific objectives and their trade-offs. We present M-TOP, an QoS-aware multi-target operator placement framework for data stream systems. Particularly, we propose an operator placement strategy considering application-specific targets consisting of objectives, their respective trade-offs specifications, bottleneck conditions, and ranking schemes to compute a suitable placement.

We implement object views with a JavaScript library that wraps shared objects and interposes on all access attempts. The security challenge is to fully mediate access to objects shared through a view and prevent privilege escalation. We discuss how object views can be deployed in two settings: same-origin sharing with rewriting-based JavaScript isolation systems like Google Caja, and inter-origin sharing between browser frames over a message-passing channel. To facilitate simple document sharing, we build a policy system for declaratively defining policies for document object views. Notably, our document policy system makes it possible to hide elements without breaking document structure invariants.

We have recently undertaken an approach to obtaining extensive intra-subnet visibility based on tapping sets of Ethernet switch ports simultaneously. However, doing so leads to a number of measurement calibration issues that require careful consideration to address. First, one must correctly account for redundant copies of packets that appear due to switch flooding, which if not accurately identified can greatly skew subsequent analysis results. We show that a simple, natural rule one might use for doing so in fact introduces systematic errors, but an altered version of the rule performs significantly better. We then employ this revised rule to aid with calibration issues concerning the fidelity of packet timestamps and the amount of measurement loss that our collection apparatus incurred. Additionally, we develop techniques to ""map"" the monitored network in terms of identifying key topological components, such as subnet boundaries, which hosts were directly monitored, and the presence of ""hidden"" switches and hubs. Finally, we present initial analyses demonstrating that the magnitude and diversity of traffic at the subnet level is in fact striking, highlighting the importance of obtaining and correctly calibrating switch-level enterprise traces.",2009,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:12,143–155,,,,,,,IMC '09,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1644910&type=pdf,,enterprise networks; network traces; switch-based packet capture; trace calibration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, the MITM who is in the VoIP signaling and/or media path can easily wiretap, divert and even hijack selected VoIP calls by tempering with the VoIP signaling and/or media traffic. Since all previously identified MITM attacks on VoIP require the adversary initially in the VoIP signaling and/or media path, there is a common belief that it is infeasible for a remote attacker, who is not initially in the VoIP path, to launch any MITM attack on VoIP. This makes people think that securing all the nodes along the normal path of VoIP traffic is sufficient to prevent MITM attacks on VoIP. In this paper, we demonstrate that a remote attacker who is not initially in the path of VoIP traffic can indeed launch all kinds of MITM attacks on VoIP by exploiting DNS and VoIP implementation vulnerabilities. Our case study of Vonage VoIP, the No. 1 residential VoIP service in the U.S. market, shows that a remote attacker from anywhere on the Internet can stealthily become a remote MITM through DNS spoofing attack on a Vonage phone, as long as the remote attacker knows the phone number and the IP address of the Vonage phone. We further show that the remote attacker can effectively wiretap and hijack targeted Vonage VoIP calls after becoming the remote MITM. Our results demonstrate that (1) the MITM attack on VoIP is much more realistic than previously thought; (2) securing all nodes along the path of VoIP traffic is not adequate to prevent MITM attack on VoIP; (3) vulnerabilities of non-VoIP-specific protocols (e.g., DNS) can indeed lead to compromise of VoIP.",2009,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 14:37,8/11/2015 13:09,61–69,,,,,,,ASIACCS '09,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1533069&type=pdf,,DNS spoofing; MITM attacks; SIP; VoIP security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
