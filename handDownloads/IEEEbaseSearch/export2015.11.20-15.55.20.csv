This aids in identifying violations of network policy such as network attacks and misconfigurations. This approach has been verified in several environments. Example responses from network attacks simulated in the laboratory including those contained in the DARPA Lincoln Lab IDS test data as well as from operational network traffic are presented.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).","1550-6002","978-1-4244-8078-4","978-0-7695-4131-0","10.1109/QSIC.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949","Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing","computer network security;program testing","IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing","","3","","21","","","14-15 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed. The major findings from the game models used for these different access schemes are highlighted.

This distributed mechanism enables our system to effectively operate within large scale and high traffic rate networks. We developed a grouping mechanism which divides computers in the network into subsets of computers with a leader and a few members. Subsequently, using a data sharing mechanism we were able to detect distributed attacks. Our data sharing mechanism added an overhead on the network traffic which is negligible compared to the overall network traffic. We simulated our method in NS2 simulation environment. Then we compared our proposed system with a centralized IDS in terms of detection rate, memory usage and packet loss rate. Results showed that our system's performance was better despite of some extra load imposed by distribution of data processing.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767356","Centralized IDS;DARPA 1999;Distributed IDS;Intrusion detection system;NS2 simulator;Nmap;Scan attack","Computer architecture;Computers;Data processing;Distributed databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","NS2 simulation environment;centralized IDS;computer networks;data capturie;data sharing mechanism;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion detection system;grouping mechanism;high traffic rate networks;large scale networks;network attacks;network traffic;packet loss rate","","0","","15","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The solution is more robust in terms of fault-tolerance and resists to denial of service attacks since the solutions carries out all the control locally. Two levels of intrusion detection are proposed to guaranty the integrity and the consistency of the distributed policy. The first level (meta-level, or administration level) guarantees that each local policy evolves according to the global security properties. This level detects attacks trying inadequate alterations of the local security policies. The second level corresponds to a classical intrusion detection system. But, it can take advantages of the local policy to detect attacks that violate the security objectives. That second level enables to integrate and to adjust various classical IDS.

However, the goal of recent hacking attacks has changed from leaking information and destruction of services to attacking large-scale systems such as critical infrastructures and state agencies. In the other words, existing defence technologies to counter these attacks are based on pattern matching methods which are very limited. Because of this fact, in the event of new and previously unknown attacks, detection rate becomes very low and false negative increases. To defend against these unknown attacks, which cannot be detected with existing technology, we propose a new model based on big data analysis techniques that can extract information from a variety of sources to detect future attacks. We expect our model to be the basis of the future Advanced Persistent Threat(APT) detection and prevention system implementations.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778962","Alarm systems;Computer crime;Data mining;Intrusion detection","Data handling;Data mining;Data models;Data storage systems;Information management;Monitoring;Security","Big Data;computer crime;data mining","APT detection;Big Data analysis system;Big Data analysis techniques;advanced persistent threat detection;computer crime;critical infrastructures;cyber-attacks;data mining;defence technologies;detection rate;future attack detection;hacking attacks;information extraction;large-scale system attacks;pattern matching methods;personal information leakage;prevention system;security systems;service destruction;state agencies;unknown attack detection","","0","","7","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One mechanism for blocking malicious traffic is filtering: access control lists (ACLs) can selectively block traffic based on fields of the IP header. Filters (ACLs) are already available in the routers today but are a scarce resource because they are stored in expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). In this paper, we develop, for the first time, a framework for studying filter selection as a resource allocation problem. Within this framework, we study four practical cases of source address/prefix filtering, which correspond to different attack scenarios and operator's policies. We show that filter selection optimization leads to novel variations of the multidimensional knapsack problem and we design optimal, yet computationally efficient, algorithms to solve them. We also evaluate our approach using data from Dshield.org and demonstrate that it brings significant benefits in practice. Our set of algorithms is a building block that can be immediately used by operators and manufacturers to block malicious traffic in a cost-efficient way.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062172","","Access control;Associative memory;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Design optimization;Filtering algorithms;Filters;Protection;Resource management;Traffic control","IP networks;content-addressable storage;knapsack problems;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","IP header;access control lists;distributed denial-of-service attacks;filter selection optimization;malicious code propagation attacks;malicious traffic;multidimensional knapsack problem;network infrastructure protection;optimal filtering;resource allocation problem;routers;scanning attacks;source address prefixes;ternary content addressable memory","","7","","21","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.","1521-9097","978-1-4577-1875-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266","Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization","Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving","Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing","Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method creates data clusters at different levels of granulation and selects the best clustering results based on some measures. The proposed method involves merging clusters into new clusters that have a coarser granulation. To evaluate performance of the proposed method, three different datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed method to other classifiers: SVM classifier, FCM fuzzy classifier, subtractive clustering fuzzy classifier.

The conventional algorithms of snorts mostly are evaluated as low-powered detection tools. In contrast, recent algorithms are able to detect intrusion properly. The major weakness in modern detection methods is that the power of IDS is restricted only to the network on which these intelligent algorithms are applied. This paper presents a new method to solve issues considering locality. We have classified any attacks to networks in the form of a protocol in the application layer which could be saved later in any and/or all of verified servers as rules. Thus all snorts across the inter-networks would be aware of the attack with enough details to immune itself. The major advantage of this method is that the old snorts strategies can also use possibilities of the new snorts dispersed over the network. We will evaluate this method and show that the resulted traffic is balanced across the Internet without imposing considerable overheads.","","978-0-7695-3930-0","978-1-4244-5423-5","10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5385146","Classification;IDS;Rule;Snort","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer network management;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Network servers;Power engineering computing;Protection;Protocols","computer network security;pattern classification","application layer protocol;attacks classification;computer network;low powered detection tool;snort intrusion detection systems","","1","","11","","","25-27 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both problems can be addressed in two different ways, either by misuse detection or anomaly-based detection. In this paper, we propose a weighted-dissimilarity-based anomaly detection method that can effectively identify abnormal behavior such as mobility patterns of mobile wireless networks. In the proposed algorithm, a normal profile is constructed from normal mobility patterns of mobile nodes in mobile wireless networks. From the constructed normal profile, the dissimilarity is computed by a weighted dissimilarity measure. If the computed dissimilarity value is greater than the dissimilarity threshold that is a system parameter, an alert message is occurred. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation. From the result of the simulation, we know that the proposed method is superior to the performance of anomaly detection methods using other dissimilarity measures.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283011","Anomaly Detection;Dissimilarity Measures;Mobile Wireless Networks;Mobility Pattern","Authentication;Cellular networks;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Pollution measurement;Weight measurement;Wireless networks","mobile radio;telecommunication security","mobile wireless network;mobility pattern;network identity theft;network intrusion;weighted-dissimilarity-based anomaly detection","","0","","8","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although many cryptographic techniques have been proposed to mitigate outside attacks, the securing of networks against inside attacks has not been addressed effectively. In this paper, a novel security system has been proposed to address the overall security requirement for Wireless Sensor Networks. Defense against outside attacks is provided using a cluster-based authentication and key management scheme using Elliptic Curve Cryptography, while inside attacks are taken care by a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System using Bayesian probabilistic model for decision making.

We propose the notion of database response policies to support our intrusion response system tailored for a DBMS. Our interactive response policy language makes it very easy for the database administrators to specify appropriate response actions for different circumstances depending upon the nature of the anomalous request. The two main issues that we address in context of such response policies are that of policy matching, and policy administration. For the policy matching problem, we propose two algorithms that efficiently search the policy database for policies that match an anomalous request. We also extend the PostgreSQL DBMS with our policy matching mechanism, and report experimental results. The experimental evaluation shows that our techniques are very efficient. The other issue that we address is that of administration of response policies to prevent malicious modifications to policy objects from legitimate users. We propose a novel Joint Threshold Administration Model (JTAM) that is based on the principle of separation of duty. The key idea in JTAM is that a policy object is jointly administered by at least k database administrator (DBAs), that is, any modification made to a policy object will be invalid unless it has been authorized by at least k DBAs. We present design details of JTAM which is based on a cryptographic threshold signature scheme, and show how JTAM prevents malicious modifications to policy objects from authorized users. We also implement JTAM in the PostgreSQL DBMS, and report experimental results on the efficiency of our techniques.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560655","Databases;intrusion detection;policies;prevention;response;threshold signatures.","Authentication;Context;Databases;Engines;Organizations;Protocols","SQL;cryptography;digital signatures;relational databases","DBMS;PostgreSQL DBMS;cryptographic threshold signature scheme;database response policies;interactive response policy language;intrusion detection response system;joint threshold administration model;policy administration;policy matching problem;relational databases","","6","","26","","2010-09-02","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We also present sC4.5 as a decision tree classification algorithm by complimenting existing C4.5 algorithm. sC4.5 preserves classification accuracy like C4.5 and makes the decision tree smaller than C4.5.","","978-0-7695-3006-2","","10.1109/IPC.2007.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438428","","Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Data security;Decision trees;IP networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Pervasive computing;Support vector machines","Internet;data mining;decision trees;security of data","Internet worms;architecture-centric network behavior model generation;data mining techniques;decision tree classification algorithm;intrusion detections;sC4.5;system architectures","","0","","10","","","11-13 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has been demonstrated by a growing number of new encryption algorithms, more intelligent firewall and intrusion detection techniques, new developments in multifactor authentication, advances in malware protection and many more. During a similar period of time the industry has seen the need for network infrastructure which provides a greater degree of trust which has resulted in the development of forensic analysis tools which meet the requirements of law enforcement agencies. Such tools must provide for commercial intelligence and national security. This paper proposes that application of the common ground between security and forensics has great potential to provide for improvements in the effort to achieve real-time adaptive security. This implies an architecture which can detect security breaches and in real-time record and analyse traffic logs in a forensically sound manner, provide corrective feedback to security devices and attempt to trace back to the source of the attack. In addressing computer security and forensic analysis from a real-time perspective, this paper recognises that some of these processes already exist, but proposes methods whereby the ongoing damage and potential risk to critical infrastructure can be reduced. This requires the implementation of a highly integrated approach to security and forensics such that they can inter-work in real-time in order to address the significant security issues which currently face the industry.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","978-0-7695-4159-4","10.1109/NSS.2010.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635616","critical infrastructure;network forensics;real-time adaptive security","Adaptive systems;Computer architecture;Fires;Forensics;Real time systems;Security;Servers","authorisation;computer forensics;real-time systems","firewall;forensic analysis tools;intrusion detection techniques;multifactor authentication;network security design;real-time adaptive security","","1","","11","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, network attacks have become more sophisticated and increasingly complex: many of current attacks are coordinated and originated in multiple networks. To detect these attacks, IDSs need to obtain information on network events from multiple networks or administrative domains. This work demonstrates that a Distributed IDS (DIDS) can be composed of existing IDSs, improving the detection of misuses in a multiple network environment. We use a grid middleware for creating a service-based intrusion detection grid. We demonstrate through experimental results that the proposed DIDS allows the integration of heterogeneous existing IDSs and improves the detection of attacks by exploring the synergy between existing IDSs.","","978-1-4244-1042-2","978-1-4244-1043-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4410980","","Computer architecture;Computer network management;Computer science;Electronic mail;Engineering management;Grid computing;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Middleware;Resource management","grid computing;middleware;security of data","IDS;grid computing based architecture;grid middleware;intrusion detection system;service-based intrusion detection grid","","0","","14","","","26-30 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, authentication mechanisms are the only barrier to prevent those attacks. Traditional password-based authentication is efficient (especially from the user point of view), but not effective -- the lack of continuous verification is a severe access control vulnerability. To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials. Therefore, extending the IDS concept to the user authentication level appears as a promising security control. The need to distinguish human users (user-centric anomaly-based detection) leads to the use of biometric features. In this paper we present a secure, reliable, inexpensive and non-intrusive technique for complementing traditional static authentication mechanisms with continuous identity verification, based on keystroke dynamics biometrics.","","978-1-4673-2624-7","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384970","access control;authentication;biometrics;identity theft;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;security","Access control;Authentication;Databases;Humans;Intrusion detection;Keyboards","authorisation;message authentication","access control vulnerability;continuous access control enforcement;continuous identity monitoring;digital identities;host-based IDS concept;human users;information systems;keystroke dynamics biometrics;legitimate user credentials;malicious activity;non-intrusive technique;password-based authentication;security control;static authentication mechanisms;user-centric anomaly-based detection","","2","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This working lets the security manager more comfy. The state machine based attack scenario reconstruction technology processes security events using clustering analysis and causal analysis concurrently, it builds a correlation state machine in memory for every attack scenario tree which is predefined by the security manager, when security events are coming, the current state set of the correlation state machine will process them, if the condition is satisfied, the current states of the state machine will transfer, it corresponds to the developing of the multi-step attack. If one of the leaf nodes of the state machine is in its current state set, an attack scenario description information will be generated and then sent to the security manager.

Thus, meta-alerts can be generated for the clusters that contain all the relevant information whereas the amount of data (i.e., alerts) can be reduced substantially. Meta-alerts may then be the basis for reporting to security experts or for communication within a distributed intrusion detection system. We propose a novel technique for online alert aggregation which is based on a dynamic, probabilistic model of the current attack situation. Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low. In addition, meta-alerts are generated with a delay of typically only a few seconds after observing the first alert belonging to a new attack instance.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5210116","Intrusion detection;alert aggregation;data stream algorithm.;generative modeling","","maximum likelihood estimation;security of data","distributed intrusion detection system;firewalls;generative data stream modeling;maximum likelihood approach;meta-alerts;online intrusion alert aggregation;probabilistic model","","12","","44","","2009-08-21","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced. This string matching algorithm can be implemented in FPGA, which can provide very fast and efficient scanning with less memory space occupied. They are designed and simulated in VHDL using Modelsim tool.","","978-1-4244-4789-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204400","Field programmable gate array;Hash;Network intrusion detection System;payload scanning","Communication system traffic control;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer networks;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;string matching;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;Modelsim tool;VHDL;Word Split Hash algorithm;content-based security threats;hardware based pattern matching;hash based algorithm;high speed network;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet header;packet inspection;packet payload;payload scanning;string matching algorithm;virus detection","","0","","10","","","4-6 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users who are connected to the internet are able to access various internet services provided by critical information infrastructure. However, some organisations have not effectively secured their critical information infrastructure and hackers, disgruntled employees and other entities have taken advantage of this by launching cyberattacks on their critical information infrastructure. They do this by using cyberthreats to exploit vulnerabilities in critical information infrastructure which organisations fail to secure. As a result, cyberthreats are able to steal or damage confidential information stored on systems or take down websites, preventing access to information. Despite this, risk strategies can be used to implement a number of security controls: preventive, detective and corrective controls, which together form a system of controls. This will ensure that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is preserved, thus reducing risks to information. This system of controls is based on the General Systems Theory, which states that the elements of a system are interdependent and contribute to the operation of the whole system. Finally, a model is proposed to address insecure critical information infrastructure.","","","","10.1109/WorldCIS.2014.7028160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028160","Critical Information Infrastructure;Cyberattacks;Cyberthreats;Security Controls;Vulnerabilities","Availability;Computer crime;Malware;Personnel;Planning","Internet;business data processing;computer crime;data integrity;data privacy;risk management","Internet service access;confidential information stealing;corrective control;critical information infrastructure protection;cyberattacks;cyberthreats;detective control;disgruntled employees;general systems theory;hackers;information access;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;organisational information;preventive control;risk reduction;security controls;vulnerability exploitation","","0","","20","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, security modules in conventional kernel-level reference monitors are usually not portable to other kernels and require detailed knowledge about kernel internals. Furthermore, different security modules are often not composable and conflict with each other. This paper describes a reference monitor called SysGuard that addresses these problems. SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability. The guard scoping on a per-process basis improves composability of individual guards, and it is implemented efficiently by using a per-process jump table of system calls. This paper describes the implementation of restricted execution environments for networks by composing simple and portable guards, and shows the advantages of the SysGuard security framework.","","0-7695-1852-4","","10.1109/PRDC.2002.1185635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185635","","Access control;Computer bugs;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Guidelines;Kernel;Monitoring;Operating systems;Portable computers;Security","authorisation;operating system kernels;software portability;system monitoring","SysGuard;access control;guards;networks;operating system kernels;per-process jump table;portable composable kernel module;reference monitors;restricted execution environments;security modules;system calls","","2","","19","","","16-18 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","","978-1-4244-0973-0","978-1-4244-0973-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems include pattern analysis techniques to discover useful patterns of system features. These patterns describe user behavior. Anomalies are computed using the set of relevant system features. The derived patterns comprise inputs of classification systems, which are based on statistical and machine learning pattern recognition techniques. Clustering methods are useful in detection of unknown attack patterns. Elimination of insignificant features is essential for a simplified, faster and more accurate detection of attacks. Genetic algorithm based clustering offers identification of significant reduced input features. We present a conceptual framework for identifying attacks for intrusion detection by applying genetic K-means algorithm.","","978-1-4799-3913-8","","10.1109/ICACCCT.2014.7019418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019418","Intrusion;attack signature;clustering;fitness value;routing algorithm","Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Protocols","computer crime;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IDS;attack identification;attack prevention;clustering method;communication system security;feature identification;genetic K-means algorithm;intrusion detection system;machine learning pattern recognition technique;pattern analysis technique;statistical technique;unknown attack pattern detection;wireless sensor network security","","0","","10","","","8-10 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other side firewalls have optimized several times and different types have been introduced. Today by integrating NIDS and firewall a new product comes to the market, which is called IPS. IPSs protect information systems from unauthorized access, damage or disruption. They are installed on network primary point and perform deep packet inspection (6 layers) so the hardware should be fast enough to sit almost invisibly within the network. This policy requires expensive hardware which is based on multiple server processor technology. It also needs appropriate changes in network design and policies. The cost may not be so reasonable for medium and small size companies. In this paper we are going to implement some kind of integration between signature-based NIDS and packet filtering firewalls which would increase the overall security by a reasonable cost in compare with modern IPSs. We try to conclude this by optimizing snort as a famous open source NIDS with a sample firewall program in Linux which is implemented by means of IPTABLES commands. The data is transferred in standard XML format. We also test the model by standard DARPA99 data sets and the results are satisfied.","","978-0-7695-3615-6","","10.1109/JCAI.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159015","Firewall;IPS;NIDS;Security;Snort","Computer security;Costs;Data security;Filtering;Hardware;Information systems;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection","Internet;Linux;XML;authorisation;digital signatures;telecommunication security;transport protocols","IPS;IPTABLES command;IPV4;Linux;XML format;intrusion prevention system;multiple server processor technology;network intrusion detection system;network primary point;network security;signature-based NIDS with packet filtering firewall;snort-open source NIDS","","0","","17","","","25-26 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because WSNs in general and in nature are unattended and physically reachable from the outside world, they could be vulnerable to physical attacks in the form of node capture or node destruction. These forms of attacks are hard to protect against and require intelligent prevention methods. It is necessary for WSNs to have security measures in place as to prevent an intruder from inserting compromised nodes in order to decimate or disturb the network performance. In this paper we present an intrusion detection algorithm for wireless sensor networks which does not require prior knowledge of network behavior or a learning period in order to establish this knowledge. We have taken a more practical approach and constructed this algorithm with small to middle-size networks in mind, like home or office networks. The proposed algorithm is also dynamic in nature as to cope with new and unknown attack types. This algorithm is intended to protect the network and ensure reliable and accurate aggregated sensor readings. Theoretical simulation results indicate that compromised nodes can be detected with high accuracy and low false alarm probability.","","978-1-4577-0786-5","","10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2011.5940938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5940938","Intrusion Detection;Security;Wireless Sensor Network","Base stations;Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","WSN;intelligent prevention method;intrusion detection algorithm;network protection;node destruction;wireless sensor network","","0","","12","","","Feb. 28 2011-March 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many problems are still not well resolved in most of IDS, such as detection evasion, intrusion containment. In order to resolve these problems, we propose a novel flexible architecture VNIDA which is based on virtual machine monitor (VMM) and has no-intrusive behavior to target system after studying popular IDS architectures. In this architecture, a separate intrusion detection domain (IDD) is added to provide intrusion detection services for all virtual machines. Specially, an IDD helper is introduced to take response to the intrusions according to the security policies. Moreover, event sensors and IDS stub, as the core components of IDS, are separately isolated from target systems, so strong reliability is also achieved in this architecture. To show the feasibility of the VNIDA, we implement a prototype based on the proposed architecture. Based on the prototype, we employed some rootkits to evaluate our VNIDA, and the results shows that VNIDA has the ability to detect them efficiently, even some potential intrusions. In addition, system performance evaluation also shows that VNIDA only introduce less than 1.25% extra overhead.","","978-0-7695-3090-1","","10.1109/WKDD.2008.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470467","","Buildings;Computer architecture;Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Open source software;Prototypes;Software engineering","authorisation;software architecture;virtual machines","detection evasion;intrusion containment;intrusion detection domain;intrusion detection system;security policies;system resource;unauthorized access prevention;virtual machine monitor","","2","","22","","","23-24 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, these features should highly characterize the behavior of the signaling traffic so that the evidence of the intrusion is not lost when only these attributes are considered for the attack detection goal.

Remote access to IEDs or user interfaces in a substation for maintenance purposes is a common practice. However, there are potential cyber-physical system vulnerabilities in a substation, e.g., unsecured standard protocols, remote controllable IEDs, and unauthorized remote access to substation IEDs. In addition, some substation IEDs and user interfaces have a web server and hence it may provide a remote configuration change and control with default passwords. Even if firewalls and cryptography schemes are used for cyber security, weak security key management cryptography and mis-configured firewalls are still exposed to intruders. From IT point of view, cyber security issues are well known and new security technologies are available. However, security research on the integration of IT and physical power systems for critical infrastructures is still an emerging area. Intruders behaviors will generate logs across all substation-level networks, e.g., IEDs, firewalls and user interfaces. For instance, the steps of Stuxnet attack are based on: (1) intrusion attempts, (2) change of the file system, (3) change of target systems setting, and (4) change of target systems status. Therefore, anomaly detection is performed based on logs of intruders foot prints. Temporal anomaly can be determined from discrepancies between event logs from two different time periods. In the proposed anomaly index, a value of 0 implies no difference, whereas 1 indicates the maximal discrepancy [1]. In order to identify the impact of substation cyber intrusion to the power grid, cyber intrusion scenarios have been conducted on the substation IT network using a SCADA testbed at University College Dublin (UCD). The first intrusion scenario involves compromised substation gateway. A false signal is generated and - n open circuit breaker (CB) command is sent to substation CBs. The second scenario is to generate forged CB status at the gateway. As a result of this attack, control center operators will observe fake data about the CB status. However, the actual substation CBs status has not changed. The third scenario is to generate fabricated analogue values to a control center using a man-in-the-middle attack. Once an intruder successfully compromises the substation LAN, (s)he is able to monitor and capture all measured data which comes from power grids. If attackers send fabricated data to the control center and the data travel through the state estimation filter, control center operators will observe an operational emergency. As a result, the operators may take emergency control actions such as reducing the generation voltage or reactive power while the power system is actually in a normal condition. There is a possibility these (logical) actions based on fabricated data will drive the system into a sequence of cascading events, leading to a power outage. Mitigation actions are conducted on substation IT and power grid. For IT mitigation, intrusion detection system (IDS) which uses anomaly detection algorithm based on temporal event construction has been used in a substation network. An Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm with an objective function that minimizes load shedding in the grid is used for power system mitigation. The proposed collaboration scheme between IDS and the firewall is able to disconnect intruders in the substation network. Emergency control actions are taken to mitigate the effects of cyber intrusions as an attempt to restore a system back to a normal condition.","1944-9925","978-1-4673-2727-5","978-1-4673-2728-2","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345766","","Circuit breakers;Computer security;Educational institutions;Substations;User interfaces","Internet;SCADA systems;cryptography;firewalls;load shedding;microprocessor chips;power grids;power system security;substations;transport protocols;user interfaces;wide area networks","IT mitigation;SCADA;Stuxnet attack;TCP/IP;Web server;anomaly detection;control center operators;cyberphysical security;emergency control;firewalls;intruders foot prints;intrusion attempts;intrusion detection system;key management cryptography;load shedding;man-in-the-middle attack;microprocessor based intelligent electronic devices;objective function;open circuit breaker command;optimal power flow algorithm;power grids;power system mitigation;remote access;remote configuration;standardized protocol;state estimation filter;substation cyber intrusion;substation gateway;user interfaces;wide area networks","","0","","1","","","22-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques such as SOM (self-organizing map) are more appropriate for an auto-mated network management such as configuration, performance and anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an auto-mated network management based on hierarchical SOM that groups similar data and visualize their clusters.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Design of an efficient and reliable node authentication protocol for such networks is a particularly challenging task since the nodes are battery-driven and resource constrained. This paper presents a robust and efficient key exchange protocol for nodes authentication in a MANET based on multi-path communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the protocol is effective even in presence of large fraction of malicious nodes in the network. Moreover, it has a minimal computation and communication overhead that makes it ideally suitable for MANETs.","","978-1-4244-8652-6","978-0-7695-4262-1","10.1109/CIMSiM.2010.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5701892","Certificate;Dynamic source routing (DSR);Mobile ad hoc network (MANET);Multi-path communication;Security;Trust","","authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;key exchange protocol;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multi-hop radio network;node authentication protocol","","1","","21","","","28-30 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless networks are becoming ubiquitous and widely used to transfer critical information such as banking accounts, credit cards, e-mails and social network credentials. The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. The current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, but failed to address other important security attributes such as availability and integrity (e.g. denial of service, session hijacking and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper we describe an anomaly-based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, based on tempo-spatial data analysis technique to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocol is based on n-gram pattern analysis.

Due to their possible deployment in remote locations for civil, educational, scientific, military purposes and security which includes intrusion detection and intrusion prevention are of utmost importance. Distributed wireless sensor networks have problems on detecting and preventing malicious nodes which always bring destructive threats and compromise multiple sensor nodes. Therefore, sensor networks need to support an authentication service for sensor identity and message transmission. Furthermore, intrusion detection and prevention schemes are always integrated in sensor security appliances so that they can enhance network security by discovering malicious or compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware protocol for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Detection system is implemented based on learning automata concept.

In an intrusion detection context, none of the main detection approaches (signature-based and anomaly-based) are fully satisfactory. False positives (detected non-attacks) and false negatives (non-detected attacks) are the major limitations of such systems. The generated alerts are elementary and in huge numbers. Hence, alert correlation techniques are used to provide a complementary analysis to link elementary alerts and provide a more global intrusion view. We propose an alert correlation and aggregation framework based on requires/provides model. The objective is to discover the logical relationships between atomic alerts potentially incorporated in multi-stage attacks.

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060942","Security;smart distirbution grid;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Communication system security;Network security;Physical layer;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","power distribution;power system security;safety systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks","SDG;WMN;backbone power network;intrusion detection;low cost high speed links;power transmission;response scheme;security framework;smart power distribution grid;smart tracking firewall;wireless communication network;wireless mesh networks;wireless networks","","30","","24","","2011-10-25","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To collect useful samples, PMCU uses P2P software actively search suspicious samples, such as software crack tools. During a 3-year period, PMCU has collected 42300 samples. To automatically classify useful samples, AMCU uploads suspicious samples to VirusTotal, a free online virus scanner. Based on VirusTotal scanning results, 11600 suspicious samples have been alerted at least once by AntiVirusWare (AVW) and 70% of these samples are Trojans and Virus tools, which are usually threatening malwares. Moreover, these suspicious 11600 samples are classified into: Blacklist with high suspiciousness; Ambitious list with moderate suspiciousness; Whitelist with low suspiciousness. Blacklist can be used to evaluate the performance of AVW based on False Negative (FN). On the other hand, Whitelist can be used to evaluate the performance of AVW based on False Positive (FP).

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications.

Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a higher and more accurate rate of detection and lower false positive rates than do the current important intrusion detection schemes of WSN.","","978-1-4244-7279-6","978-1-4244-7280-2","10.1109/ICICTA.2010.522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522793","CUSUM Algorithm;anomaly detection;multi-class CUSUM algorithm","Change detection algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","NS2 tool;WSN security;anomaly detection;cumulative sum algorithm;intrusion detection schemes;multiclass CUSUM algorithm;network traffic sequences;wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","11-12 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such locality is intuitive and is very well studied over the years. In this work we study temporal locality in the packet payload. Temporal locality can also be viewed as redundancy and we observe significant redundancy in the packet payload. We investigate mechanisms to exploit temporal locality in a networking application and choose Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) as a case study. An IDS like the popular Snort [4] operates by scanning packet payload for known attack strings. It first builds a Finite State Machine (FSM) from a database of attack strings, and traverses this FSM using bytes from the packet payload. So we propose a redundancy-aware FSM traversal that skips the processing of redundant bytes. We have deployed our redundancy-aware FSM traversal in Snort, and we observe important performance benefits.","","978-1-4673-1143-4","978-1-4673-1145-8","10.1109/ISPASS.2012.6189211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189211","","Acceleration;Automata;Clocks;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Redundancy","computer network security;finite state machines;string matching","Snort;attack string;commodity multicore;finite state machine;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;networking application;packet header field;packet payload redundancy;packet payload scanning;pattern matching;redundancy-aware FSM traversal;redundant bytes;temporal locality","","0","","4","","","1-3 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption. Finally, we show that our approach is easy to install and configure across all Android platforms including mobile phones, tablets, and small notebooks without any user perceivable delay for most of the regular Android applications.","","978-1-4673-1796-2","978-0-7695-4713-8","10.1109/MDM.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341374","Encrypted filesystem;Full disk encryption;I/O performance;Smart handheld devices","Databases;Encryption;Kernel;Libraries;Smart phones","cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;input-output programs;smart phones;telecommunication security","Android;FUSE;I/O-intensive program;NIST certified cryptographic algorithm;PII data;SMS;data-at-rest;database transaction performance;email;encrypted operation;encryption filesystem;end user privacy;file system in user space;heterogeneous smart gadget device;location-based service;mobile device;personal identifiable information;read operation;security;smart handheld device;smart phone;social media;tablet;write operation","","5","","33","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As email service usage is increasing day by day, hackers or attackers are also playing a vital role to destruct email service and even to crash the email server. Due to this, it is a challenging task today to the system administrators to provide secure email service. In this paper, security policy is defined at operating system level, mail application level and network infrastructure level. A policy at system level specifies mandatory usage profile, usages of system sensitive resources such as file system objects, processes, system memory and inter process communication objects. Policies for mail application are defined with sensitive files/directories and parameters, which have impact in delivering a service. Policies for network are defined for controlling inbound and outbound traffic, specifying demilitarized zone, denying misuse of public IP and detecting suspicious network activity. The proposed system architecture supports the layered approach in policy enforcement, proactive defensive mechanism against security violations and scope for new policy discovery. The approach is prototyped on Linux-2.4.21-4 and have built rules for squirrel mail version 1.4.5 to detect security violations in a mail service at run-time.","","0-7695-2635-7","","10.1109/ICIT.2006.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273182","","Communication system security;Communication system traffic control;Computer crashes;Computer hacking;File systems;Network servers;Operating systems;Postal services;Prototypes;Runtime","IP networks;computer crime;electronic mail","demilitarized zone;file system objects;inter process communication objects;mail application level;mandatory usage profile;network infrastructure;operating system;policy enforcement;policy specification;public IP;secure email service;security policy;security violations;squirrel mail version 1.4.5;suspicious network activity;system memory","","0","1","15","","","18-21 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Image search algorithm is described to enable distributed image processing and search within each sensor. Then energy model is presented to calculate energy efficiency for various cases of imaging to determine trade off between network traffic and sensor life time. The simulations are carried out based on consideration of continuous monitoring or event driven activity on the perimeter and gateway initiated query for image search. Simulation results show that energy saving is significant if camera is active during motion only, and uses distributed local image search resulting in reduced network traffic.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945312","Image identification in sensor network;Image sensor networks;camera sensor networks;distributed image search","Cameras;Energy efficiency;Image sensors;Logic gates;Monitoring;Robot sensing systems;Security","distributed memory systems;distributed sensors;energy conservation;image processing;image retrieval;image sensors;telecommunication traffic;visual communication","computational power;distributed image processing;distributed memory;energy saving;energy-efficient image search algorithm;gateway initiated query;hybrid delivery model;image acquisition;image sensor networks;image transmission;network traffic","","0","","21","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

XXII International Symposium on","20091204","2009","","","1","5","Identifying and detecting Trojans (malicious software installed and run on a host, without the acquiescence of the host's owner) is a major element in delivering computer security. As with any computer application, installation of a Trojan leaves a ldquofootprintrdquo on the systems resources. However, detection is non-trivial: the detector must be able to recognize the symptoms against a background of a range of other (ldquosaferdquo) activities, which also consume system resources. Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection). Therefore, we wished to explore the potential of an economical approach that explicitly takes into account resources used. In order to achieve our aim, we explore the possibility of making use of the existing widely deployed management information database (the MIB) as the basis for detecting attempts to install Trojan software on networked systems. We identify the characteristics of typical attacks in respect of the impact they have on particular MIB objects, and propose a decision-tree based algorithm which can detect Trojan activity. We identify the likely effectiveness of this system, with particular reference to the need for such information to be gathered in a timely manner.","","978-1-4244-4220-1","978-1-4244-4221-8","10.1109/ICAT.2009.5348410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5348410","Anomaly detection;Management Information Base;Network security;Trojan attacks","Application software;Costs;Data processing;Data security;Gain control;Information management;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Resource management;Technological innovation","database management systems;decision trees;invasive software","MIB-based IDS-IPS system;Trojan detection;computer security;decision-tree based algorithm;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;management information database","","1","","6","","","29-31 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on the angle detection accuracy of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme, which is one of primary factors for rapid establishment of FSO links. The positioning process is composed of two parts. One is the spot location, which acquires the position of the imaging spot of the incident beam. The other is the mapping from spot location to incident angle, with which the position of imaging spot can be turned into the angles of the incident beam. For the first part, an improved centroid locating algorithm is present to realize the subpixel accuracy of spot location, and theory and simulation are carried out to demonstrate the improved accuracy of this algorithm. For the second part, we propose the fisheye lens calibration algorithm, which integrates the fisheye lens projection model and natural neighbor interpolation algorithm. In addition, by combining with the measured data, the angle detection accuracy of this method can be improved gradually with the increased number of the measured data. The simulation results indicate that this new method can provide high-precision positioning of the laser beams, and the maximum angle detection error of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme can be less than 0.054° (0.94 mrad).","0733-8724","","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2360313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915668","Fisheye lens calibration;fisheye lens calibration;free space optical link;high-accuracy angle detection;spot location;ultra-wide field-of-view acquisition;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition","Accuracy;Imaging;Interpolation;Laser beams;Lenses;Measurement by laser beam;Optical fiber communication","calibration;laser beams;lenses;optical communication equipment;optical images;optical links;optical projectors;photodetectors","Voigt anomalous dispersion optical filter;centroid locating algorithm;fisheye lens calibration algorithm;fisheye lens projection model;free-space optical links;high-accuracy angle detection;high-precision laser beam positioning;incident angle;incident beam imaging spot;integrated optics;natural neighbor interpolation algorithm;ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition scheme","","0","","21","","2014-10-02","Dec.1, 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept of virtualization has been introduced into many popular IDS implementations due to the advantage on isolation and fast recovery in case of being compromised. Advanced capability for combining these newly emerged virtual machine (VM) based IDS approaches is another requirement for IDS management. This paper proposes an extensible IDS management architecture based on a new design of event gatherer component.
