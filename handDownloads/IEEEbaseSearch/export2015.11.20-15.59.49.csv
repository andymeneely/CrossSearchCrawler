Wireless medium is accessible to malicious and legitimate users which makes the network much vulnerable to different internal and external attacks. Routing protocols for MANET are responsible for mobility of wireless networks and these are the common target of these threats. Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) is commonly employed and an efficient routing protocol. Black hole attack is a common active and internal attack which can misdirects the routing in reactive protocols. In this paper, a solution is proposed to avoid Black hole attack in AODV. Proposed solution uses a route legitimacy value attached with RREP which ensures that the route is free from black hole node.","","978-1-4799-2053-2","","10.1109/ICOSST.2014.7029341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029341","Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector;Black hole Attack;MANET;Routing Table;Sequence number;TTL","Ad hoc networks;Maintenance engineering;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Vectors","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV-based MANET;RREP;ad hoc on-demand distance vector;black hole attack;internal attack;mobile ad hoc networks;route legitimacy value;routing protocols;wireless networks","","0","","23","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the numerous smart meters being connected through mesh networks open new opportunities for attackers to interfere with communications and compromise utilities' assets or steal customers' private information. The goal of this paper is to survey the various threats facing AMIs and the common attack techniques used to realize them in order to identify and understand the requirements for a comprehensive intrusion detection solution. The threat analysis leads to an extensive “attack tree” that captures the attackers' key objectives (e.g., energy theft) and the individual attack steps (e.g., eavesdropping on the network) that would be involved in achieving them. With reference to the attack tree, we show the type of information that would be required to effectively detect attacks. We also suggest that the widest coverage in monitoring the attacks can be provided by a hybrid sensing infrastructure that uses both a centralized intrusion detection system and embedded meter sensors.","","978-1-4673-0910-3","978-1-4673-0909-7","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486016","","Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mesh networks;Monitoring;Routing;Sensors","metering;power system security;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","AMI threat analysis;advanced metering infrastructures;attack detection;attack tree;centralized intrusion detection system;common attack techniques;comprehensive intrusion detection solution;embedded meter sensors;hybrid sensing infrastructure;mesh networks;smart meters","","11","","14","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated. Furt- ermore, superior configurations can be identified and assessed without endangerment of the productive network.","2325-5366","978-1-4799-0450-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568386","comparative evaluation;intrusion detection;intrusion detection correlation;optimization;real-world evaluation;test environment","Charge coupled devices;Correlation;Databases;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sensors","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IT security;IT systems;NIDS;detection capability;false alarm rates;intrusion detection systems;knowledge based systems;network traffic;periodic performance evaluation studies;real - world networks;real-productive systems;system performance;unaltered live record","","2","","29","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

String searching is at the core of the tools we use to curb this explosion, such as search engines, network intrusion detection systems, spam filters, and anti-virus programs. But as communication speed grows, our capability to perform string searching in real-time seems to fall behind. Multi-core architectures promise enough computational power to cope with the incoming challenge, but it is still unclear which algorithms and programming models to use to unleash this power. We have parallelized a popular string searching algorithm, Aho-Corasick, on the IBM Cell/B.E. processor, with the goal of performing exact string matching against large dictionaries. In this article we propose a novel approach to fully exploit the DMA-based communication mechanisms of the Cell/B.E. to provide an unprecedented level of aggregate performance with irregular access patterns. We have discovered that memory congestion plays a crucial role in determining the performance of this algorithm. We discuss three aspects of congestion: memory pressure, layout issues and hot spots, and we present a collection of algorithmic solutions to alleviate these problems and achieve quasi-optimal performance. The implementation of our algorithm provides a worst- case throughput of 2.5 Gbps, and a typical throughput between 3.3 and 4.4 Gbps, measured on realistic scenarios with a two-processor Cell/B.E. system.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-1693-6","978-1-4244-1694-3","10.1109/IPDPS.2008.4536300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4536300","","Aggregates;Computer architecture;Dictionaries;Digital filters;Explosions;Intrusion detection;Power system modeling;Protection;Search engines;Throughput","multiprocessing systems;string matching;text analysis","Aho-Corasick;Cell/B.E. processor;exact string matching;high-speed string searching;hot spots;irregular access patterns;large dictionaries;layout issues;memory congestion;memory pressure;multicore architecture","","8","","19","","","14-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The audit data is partitioned into segments with a fixed length. Program and user behaviors are, in turn, measured by the frequencies of individual system calls or commands embedded in each segment of the data, and NMF is applied to extract the features from the blocks of audit data associated with the normal behaviors. The model describing the normal program and user behaviors are built based on these features and deviation from the normal program and user behaviors above a predetermined threshold is considered as anomalous.

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences. Robustness against smart attacks is also proved with respect to a comprehensive set of attack patterns and under different network load conditions.

Therefore and in this paper, remove correlated attributes algorithm has been proposed to select the most effective features on used in network traffic classification. Since that removing related features in a classification model minimizes the detection model error rate, It is a high likelihood that proposed model implementation increase flooding attack classification accuracy rate.

Classic SSO systems re-authenticate a user to different applications based on a fixed set of attributes (e.g. Username-password combinations). However, the use of a fixed set of attributes fail to account for mobility and contextual variations of user activities. Thus, in a SSO based system, robust persistent authentications and secure session termination management are vital for ensuring secure operations. In this paper we propose a novel persistent authentication technique using multiplicative attribute graph model. We use multiple attribute based persistent authentication model using facial biometrics, location and activity specific information. We propose a novel membership (or group affiliations) based session management technique for user initiated SSO global logout management. Significance and viability of these methods are demonstrated by security, complexity and numerical analyses. In conclusion, our model provides meaningful insights and more pragmatic approaches for persistent authentication and session termination management in implementing SSO based mobile collaborative applications.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011254","mobile systems;multiplicative attribute graph;persistent authentication;single sign on","Authentication;Biological system modeling;Biometrics (access control);Collaboration;Face;Mobile communication","authorisation;biometrics (access control);graph theory;mobile computing","SSO based mobile collaborative applications;SSO global logout management;activity specific information;contextual variations;facial biometrics;location information;membership based session management technique;mobility variations;multiple attribute based persistent authentication model;multiplicative attribute graph approach;robust persistent authentications;secure session termination management;single-sign-on mobile systems","","0","","33","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the huge hardware requirement, it was difficult to implement an NFA-based string matching circuit with the whole Snort 2.3.3 rule (35461 characters) that processes at 10 Gbps on a single FPGA. To reduce the circuit area, we eliminate redundant states of the NFA with the Aho-Corasick approach and redundant AND-gates in the NFA. Consequently, our method reduces the resource requirements by over 50% as compared with previous NFA-based circuits, and the synthesis result shows that a matching circuit that includes the whole Snort 2.3.3 rule can be implemented onto a single Xilinx Virtex-II pro xc2vp-100 with throughput over 10 Gbps","","1-4244-0312-X","","10.1109/FPL.2006.311317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101079","","Circuit synthesis;Clocks;Data processing;Electronics industry;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Industrial electronics;Intrusion detection;Network synthesis;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;security of data","10 Gbit/s;Aho-Corasick approach;FPGA;Snort 2.3.3 rule;Xilinx Virtex-II pro xc2vp-100;field programmable gate arrays;intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automation;redundant AND-gates;scalable NFA-based string matching circuit","","0","1","8","","","28-30 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To perform this checking different pattern matching methods are used by NIDS. The most popular method to implement pattern matching is to use of Finite Automata (FA). Generally, regular expressions are used to represent most of the attack signatures defined by NIDS. They are implemented using finite automata, which takes the payload of packet as input string. However, existing approaches of Finite Automata (FA), both deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) for pattern matching are having their own advantages and some drawbacks. The DFA based pattern matching methods are fast enough but require more memory. However, NFA based pattern matching methods are comparatively takes less memory but the speed of matching is very slow, to overcome these drawbacks of finite automata there are many approaches have been proposed.

The system trains a normal model using data that contains no attacks and then checks each access to the registry to determine whether or not the behavior is abnormal and corresponds to an attack. A new approach to register anomaly detection (RAD) is proposed in the meaning of model generator and anomaly detector. A self organizing map (SOM), a type of artificial neural network model, is used as an anomaly detection algorithm. The system is trained on a set of normal registry accesses using SOM algorithm and then it is used to detect the behavior of malicious software.

Benefits of achieving a high level of digital forensic investigation readiness include, but are not limited to, higher admissibility of digital evidence in a court of law, better utilisation of resources (including time and financial resources) and higher awareness of forensic investigation readiness. The problem that this paper addresses is that there is no harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model with appropriate implementation guidelines and, thus, there is a lack of an effective and standardised implementation of digital forensic investigation readiness measures within organisations. Valjarevic and Venter have, in their previous work, proposed a harmonised digital forensic investigation readiness process model. This paper proposes implementation guidelines for such a harmonised digital forensic investigation process model in order to help practitioners and researchers to successfully implement the proposed model.

The construction of traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that use manually created rules based upon expert knowledge is knowledge-intensive and is not suitable in the context of this big data problem. This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks.

In this paper, we report our progress in the development of an agent-based cooperative anomaly detection scheme for wireless ad hoc networks. The approach addresses the underlying distributed and cooperative nature of wireless ad hoc networks and adds one more dimension of cooperation to the intrusion detection process. That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors. Without the requirements of pre-labeled attack data, the approach eliminates the time-consuming labeling process and the impacts of imbalanced dataset.

There are many defensive options available to these policies, but current mechanically-enforced security policies are limited to traditional admission-based access control. There are defensive capabilities available that include logging, firewalls, honeypots, rollback/recovery, and intrusion detection systems, but policy enforcement is essentially limited to allow/deny semantics. Furthermore, access-control mechanisms operate independently on each service, which often leads to inconsistent or incorrect application of the intended system-wide policy. To begin to solve these problems, we propose a new system for defense-in-depth using global security policies. Under a global security policy, every policy decision is made with near-global knowledge, and re-evaluated as global knowledge changes, given an initial configuration provided by the administrator. Using a variety of actuators, we make the full array of defensive capabilities available to the global policy.

This approach leverages the DRAMA policy based network management system and the Smart Firewall system to meet the above requirement. It allows administrators to specify low-level network access control policies for each INFOCON level using high-level policies (adapted from the Smart Firewalls approach). The high-level policies are securely distributed to all the policy decision points in the network, which evaluate and enforce policies in a distributed manner. As a consequence of enforcing policies in response to INFOCON level changes, appropriate access control policies will be derived and applied to local firewall devices without human intervention.

As the data traffic generation is based on control traffic, the behavior of the two planes is expected to be similar during normal behavior. Therefore, detecting dissimilarity (via cross-correlation) between the traffic of the two planes can indicate an abnormal behavior.

Proceedings","20030225","2002","1","","395","399 vol.1","High-speed, switched networks present scalability challenges to a network intrusion detection system, both in terms of the volume of data that must be analyzed, and the extent to which sensors must be inserted into the switched network to achieve comprehensive visibility. An architecture that uses a single point for intrusion assessment would quickly become overwhelmed with incoming event data from intrusion sensors that are deployed on even a moderate number of high-speed links. This is particularly true if an earnest attack (generating many events in a short period of time) is underway. The authors propose a novel architecture that hierarchically distributes the assessment function into two assessment categories - tactical assessment, and strategic assessment. The tactical assessment function provides low-level event correlation and decision making for a small sub-network (e.g., a department LAN, an ATM switch peer group, etc.), and is capable of providing fast, real-time response when millisecond response times are required due to network attacks. The strategic assessment function, on the other hand, implements high-level event correlation, which is useful when a larger view of the network is required (e.g., for low intensity or distributed attacks). The tactical assessment engines interface to the strategic assessment engine by, filtering and summarizing low-level events, ensuring that the strategic assessment engine's workload remains manageable. This paper describes the distributed intrusion assessment architecture in more detail, presents a few application scenarios that benefit from hierarchical attack assessment, and summarizes ongoing work in developing prototype components for this architecture.","","0-7803-7625-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1180474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180474","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Decision making;Delay;Engines;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Scalability;Sensor systems;Switches","asynchronous transfer mode;correlation methods;local area networks;packet switching;security of data;telecommunication security","ATM networks;ATM switch peer group;decision making;department LAN;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion assessment architecture;event data;filtering;high-level event correlation;high-speed links;high-speed switched networks;intrusion mitigation;intrusion sensors;low intensity attacks;low-level event correlation;network architecture;network attacks;network intrusion detection system;real-time response;scaleable architecture;strategic assessment engine;sub-network;tactical assessment engines","","3","","6","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes people put forward higher requirements for the speed and real-time of network traffic anomaly detection. How to quickly perceive the traffic anomaly is a new demand in the network anomaly detection. Due to the shortage of the conventional detection methods in terms of speed, a fast anomaly detection scheme is proposed in this paper, which is based on the iterative estimation of Hurst parameter. The anomaly can be determined through the value of estimation. Meanwhile, by on-line we can estimate continuously and refresh the value of Hurst according to the latest network traffic, and then we can get the latest traffic data and speed up the process of anomaly detection.

Does ldquono alarmrdquo mean no intruder is present or non-detection of an intruder? The consequence is ambiguity in interpreting the alarm status of an intrusion detection system. Two formulations, consistent with Dempster-Shafer theory, are presented that assist the security operator in distinguishing detections from nuisance alarms each time an alarm occurs, and distinguishing no activity from non-detection in the absence of any alarm. The first representation fuses multiple values of probability of detection or nuisance alarm likelihood, while retaining the dependence on factors (e.g., weather, terrain, intruder activity) that influence detection capability and nuisance alarm occurrence. The second representation associates a level of belief for an alarm occurrence being a detection, a nuisance alarm, or a false alarm, or for the absence of an alarm indicating no intruder present versus non-detection of an intruder.","","978-1-4244-1816-9","978-1-4244-1817-6","10.1109/CCST.2008.4751282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751282","Alarm interpretation;Dempster-Shafer Theory;Intrusion detection;Nuisance alarm;Probability of detection;Sensors;Terrain;Weather","Cameras;Force sensors;Fuses;Humans;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Personnel;Research and development;Security;Sensor systems","inference mechanisms;security of data","Dempster-Shafer theory;alarm status;exterior intrusion detection;false alarm;intrusion detection system;nuisance alarm detections;nuisance alarm likelihood;security operator","","0","","8","","","13-16 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modern intrusion detection applications face complex requirements - they need to be reliable, extensible, easy to manage, and have low maintenance cost. In recent years, data mining - based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have demonstrated high accuracy, good generalization to novel types of intrusion, and robust behaviour in a changing environment. Still, significant challenges exist in design and implementation of production quality IDSs. Instrumenting components such as data transformations, model deployment, and cooperative distributed detection remain a labour intensive and complex engineering endeavour. This paper describes a database centric architecture that leverages data mining with .NET to address these challenges. It also offers numerous advantages in terms of alert infrastructure, security, scalability, reliability and also has data analysis tools.

Due to the effective data analysis method, data mining is introduced into IDS. This paper brings an idea of applying data mining algorithms to intrusion detection database. Performance of various rule and function based classifiers like Part, Ridor, NNge, DTNB, JRip, Conjunctive Rule, One R, Zero R, Decision Table, RBF, Multi Layer Perception and SMO algorithms are compared and result shows that SMO classification algorithm performs well in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity.

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.","","978-1-4673-4527-9","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428","Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency","","0","","10","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as “good” or “bad” depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM “learns” the structure of the “good” and “bad” SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also “real” SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution. The preliminary results of such classification look very promising and are presented in the final section of this paper.","1930-529X","978-1-4673-0920-2","978-1-4673-0919-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503527","","","pattern classification;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","SVM;communication network;machine learning approach;malicious SIP message classification;protocol standard;session initiation protocol;sessions-based applications;straightforward lexical analyzer;support vector machine;syntax filter;two-stage filter","","0","","15","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the main objective of this paper is to reduce the Multilevel Channel Conflicts in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks .Channel allowance is an elementary affair of resource activity that aggregates the comprehension and extent of attendants. As dormant channel apportionment misses the heuristic applications to allot the channels to the cages. headed channel assignment behaves beneficially inferior leaden traffic. assiduous channel allowance apprise behaves inferior brightness as well as alleviated traffic. To advance the benefit of the channel chunk we try an alloyed application for channel allowance in which FCA and DCA apprises coupled will work concomitantly.

Security and other content based networking devices are required to decompress the traffic of tens of thousands concurrent connections in order to inspect the content for different signatures. The overhead imposed by the decompression inhibits most devices from handling compressed traffic, which in turn either limits traffic compression or introduces security holes and other dysfunctionalities. The ACCH algorithm was the first to present a unified approach to pattern matching and decompression, by taking advantage of information gathered in the decompression phase to accelerate the pattern matching. ACCH accelerated the DFA-based Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SPC (Shift-based Pattern matching for Compressed traffic) that accelerates the commonly used Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. SPC is simpler and has higher throughput and lower storage overhead than ACCH. Analysis of real web traffic and real security devices signatures shows that we can skip scanning up to 87.5% of the data and gain performance boost of more than 51% as compared to ACCH. Moreover, the additional storage requirement of the technique requires only 4KB additional information per connection as compared to 8KB of ACCH.","","978-1-4244-8454-6","978-1-4244-8455-3","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5986030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5986030","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Huffman coding;Inspection;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;cellular radio;data compression;hypermedia;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH algorithm;DFA- based Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;SPC;Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm;compressed Web traffic;concurrent connection;content based networking device;real security device signature;shift-based pattern matching;standard GZIP;storage requirement;wireless Web device","","2","","25","","","4-6 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are a lot of clustering algorithms proposed for anomaly detection on IDS, but most of them find clusters in the highest dimension of data. CLIQUE Partitioning (CP) is one of the clustering algorithm that can find clusters from the subspace of data. Testing is done to analyze system's performance based on computational time, completeness, and false alarm rate.

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack. In this paper, to detect such nodes effectively, we propose a Permutation based Acknowledgement for most widely used reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing AODV. This mechanism is enhancement of Adaptive Acknowledgement (AACK) and TWO-ACK, here we have tried to show the efficiency increment by decreasing number of messages routed in the network.","","978-1-4799-3078-4","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968417","Ad-hoc network;Black Hole;MANET;Permutation;Security","Bandwidth;Decision support systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV;MANET;TWO-ACK;adaptive acknowledgement;black hole attack detection mechanism;mobile ad-hoc network;permutation based acknowledgement;reactive protocol ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;wireless links","","0","","15","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, the network security policy is defined as the collection of service access rules between various network zones. The specification of the security policy is often incomplete since all possible service access paths may not be explicitly covered. This policy is implemented in the network interfaces in a distributed fashion through sets of access control (ACL) rules. Formally verifying whether the distributed ACL implementation conforms to the security policy is a major requirement. The complexity of the problem is compounded as some combination of network services may lead to inconsistent hidden access paths. Further, failure of network link(s) may result in the formation of alternative routing paths and thus the existing security implementation may defy the policy. In this study, an integrated formal verification and fault analysis framework has been proposed which derives a correct ACL implementation with respect to given policy specification and also ensures that the implementation is fault tolerant to certain number of link failures. The verification incorporates boolean modelling of the security policies and ACL implementations and then formulates a satisfiability checking problem.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2009.0174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672444","","","Boolean functions;authorisation;business communication;computer network security;fault tolerant computing;formal verification;network routing;telecommunication network topology","access control rules;alternative routing paths;boolean modelling;enterprise network;fault analysis;fault tolerant;formal approach;formal verification;hidden access paths;integrated security analysis;network interfaces;network link failure;network security policy;network topology;service access rules","","3","","","","","December 2010","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Recently, two approaches have arisen to address this threat: ubiquitous deployment of end system monitors and custom hardware to replace switching infrastructure. This paper presents a third way: exploiting the VLAN capabilities of modern switches to enforce that all LAN communications must traverse and meet the approval of an intrusion detection monitor that operates separately from the switches. This architecture can realize two key benefits: (1) deployment and operation in today's enterprise networks without requiring replacement of existing network infrastructure, and (2) the use of highly flexible, commodity PCs for LAN monitoring, rather than algorithms embedded in difficult-to-reprogram custom hardware","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198828","","Communication switching;Communication system traffic control;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Monitoring;Personal communication networks;Protection;Switches","local area networks;security of data;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;telecommunication switching","Bro-LAN pervasive network inspection;LAN traffic control;VLAN capabilities;external access links;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system","","0","","3","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A recently developed hypothesis in immunology, the Danger Theory, states that our immune system responds to the presence of intruders through sensing molecules belonging to those invaders, plus signals generated by the host indicating danger and damage. Integrating the ldquoDanger Theoryrdquo, negative selection and immune memory, the paper proposes a novel artificial immune model for intrusion detection. The paper considers the coordination of DCs in the innate immune system and T cells in the adaptive immune system. At the same time the paper focuses on how to define ldquodanger signalsrdquo and considers whether to have a danger to the protected system as the basis of defining ldquoself-nonselfrdquo, in which the self is dynamically updated. The theory analysis shows that the dynamic self can improve the problem of error detection rate increasing sharply, and the dual detection method of DCs detecting the behaviors of antigens and T cells detecting the antigens can also significantly decrease error detection rate.","","978-0-7695-3490-9","","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756899","","Application software;Change detection algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer industry;Conferences;Distributed control;Immune system;Industrial training;Intrusion detection;Protection","artificial immune systems;artificial intelligence;genetic algorithms;security of data","adaptive immune system;artificial immune model;danger theory;error detection rate problem;intrusion detection model","","2","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The interesting alerts are always mixed with irrelevant, duplicate and non interesting alerts. Huge volumes of poorly sorted and unclustered alerts frustrate the efforts of analysts when identifying the interesting alerts. Therefore, the unmanageable amount of poorly sorted alerts is a critical issue affecting the performance of IDSs. This paper proposes a better mechanism to compute the similarities of the verified alerts using the distance among the new alert features. Our approach uses the both clustering technique and Supporting Evidence (Vulnerability data) to build a robust Alert Cluster. Our goal was to reduce the unnecessary alert load and improve the quality of alerts sent to the analysts. We can confidently state that our approach significantly reduced the unnecessary alert loads and improved the quality of alerts.","","978-1-4244-5537-9","","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563925","Alert Clustering;Alert Reduction;Data Mining;Supporting Evidence;Vulnerability data","Computers;Logic gates","pattern clustering;security of data","IDS alert;alert cluster;intrusion detection system;supporting evidence","","1","","16","","","9-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system consists of base-station with laser source and sensor nodes with MEMS CCR as a reflector. As a method to position the sensor node, Time of Flight and direction angle between base-station and sensor node are used. The problem in this system is that the intensity of the laser decreases as it propagates forward because of divergence angle and that the reflect area of MEMS CCR is too small to reflect enough power. This makes it hard to measure the TOF and direction angle and as a result the measured distance is very short. To resolve this problem, convergent beam is introduced. The convergent beam has a characteristic that there exists focal point on the optical axis so the beam can be focused on that point. If the focal length is adjusted far away from the base-station, the cross sectional area of the beam decreases as the beam propagates and the intensity of the beam increases enough to use TOF. After this point, the laser beam propagates as like divergent beam. This has the effect that using more powerful laser at nearer to the sensor node. Also by the theoretical analysis of the convergent beam, the offset from the optical axis which can detect MEMS CCR is obtained. To analyze the effect of convergent beam, the beam propagation function is introduced and by this, simulation is conducted.","2093-7121","978-8-9932-1506-9","","10.1109/ICCAS.2014.6987902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987902","Convergent beam;Localization;MEMS CCR;Positioning;Sensor Node;WSN","Optical sensors;Wireless sensor networks","laser beams;micromechanical devices;optical elements;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks","MEMS CCR;TOF measurement;base-station;convergent beam analysis;corner cube reflector;direction angle;divergence angle;divergent beam;focal length;focal point;laser beam propagation;laser source;microelectromechanical system;optical axis;optics-based WSN;sensor node positioning performance;time of flight;wireless sensor network system","","0","","7","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, peer-to-peer traffic may compromise the performance of enterprise critical networked applications or network-based tasks or may overload the network infrastructure of Internet service providers, being desirable that this traffic be blocked in some situations. However, this task may be difficult to achieve, namely for networks operating at very high-speed bit rates and low latency and/or when the traffic is encrypted. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and blocking encrypted traffic generated by eMule, which is one of the most difficult to detect among popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The proposed method is based on eMule signatures, which are coded as SNORT rules, this system being used to detect and block eMule traffic. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate the proposed method. The contribution of the paper falls within peer-to-peer security or within legal and regulatory issues.","","978-1-4244-5084-8","978-0-7695-3831-0","10.1109/AP2PS.2009.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358988","deep packet inspection;eDonkey Network;legal and regulatory issues;peer-to-peer file sharing applications;peer-to-peer security;traffic identification and classification","Application software;Cryptography;Inspection;Law;Legal factors;Multimedia systems;Payloads;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;cryptography;digital signatures;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","Internet service providers;SNORT rules;application signatures;eDonkey network;eMule signatures;eMule traffic;encrypted traffic detection;network-based tasks;peer-to-peer file sharing applications;peer-to-peer traffic","","0","","25","","","11-16 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems have traditionally been based on the characterization of a user and tracking of activity of the user to see if it matches that characterization. Artificial neural networks provide a feasible approach to model complex engineering systems such as intrusion detection. Applications of artificial neural networks to characterize the behavior of users have been well studied in the recent past, without considering the enormous time they take to get modeled. In this paper we present an implementation of a parallel version of the back propagation training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks that are used for detecting intruders based on the MPI standard on Linux PC clusters. The experiments show a considerable increase in speedup during training and testing of the neural network, which in turn increases the speed of detecting intruders","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635453","","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;Intrusion detection;Linux;Neural networks;Systems engineering and theory","backpropagation;computer networks;feedforward neural nets;security of data;telecommunication security","Linux PC clusters;anomaly detection;artificial neural network;backpropagation training algorithm;cluster computing;complex engineering systems;feedforward neural networks;multilayered security architecture;network intrusion-detection systems","","0","","29","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To ensure a good level of security, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been widely deployed and many techniques to detect, identify and classify attacks have been proposed, developed and tested either offline or online. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based detection technique using a genetic algorithm named Genetic Clustering for Anomaly-based Detection (GC-AD). GC-AD uses a dissimilarity measure to form k clusters. It, then, applies a genetic process where each chromosome represents the centroids of the k clusters. A two-stage fitness function is proposed. i) We introduce a confidence interval to refine the clusters in order to obtain partitions that are more homogeneous. ii) We compute and maximize the inter-cluster variance over the generations. The accuracy of our technique is tested on different subset from KDD99 dataset. The results are discussed and compared to k-means clustering algorithm.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176182","Anomaly-based IDS;KDD 99;clustering;false negative rate;false positive rate;genetic algorithm","Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Statistics","genetic algorithms;pattern clustering;security of data","GC-AD;IDS;KDD99 dataset;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;clustering-based detection technique;computer systems;dissimilarity measure;genetic algorithm;genetic clustering technique;k-means clustering algorithm;network resources security;two-stage fitness function","","0","","19","","","1-3 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present four models to describe stepping-stone intrusion. We also propose the idea applying signal processing technology to stepping-stone intrusion detection. We present the preliminary results of applying correlation coefficients to detecting stepping-stone intrusion. The contribution of this paper is that we are the first to apply correlation coefficient to stepping-stone detection, and more importantly, it does not have to monitor a session for a long time to conclude if there is a stepping-stone intrusion.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","187","194","This paper describes the architecture and provides early test results of the reconnaissance intrusion detection system (RIDS) prototype. RIDS is a session oriented, statistical tool, that relies on training to mold the parameters of its algorithms, capable of detecting even distributed stealthy reconnaissance attacks. It consists of two main functional modules or stages: the reconnaissance activity profiler (RAP), followed by the reconnaissance alert correlation (RAC), along with a security console. RAP is a session-oriented module capable of detecting stealthy scanning and probing attacks, while RAC is an alert-correlation module that fuses the RAP alerts into attack scenarios and discovers the distributed stealthy attack scenarios, RIDS has been evaluated against two data sets: (a) the DARPA'98 data, and (b) 3 weeks of experimental data generated using the CONEX testbed, running at average Ethernet speeds. RIDS has demonstrably achieved remarkable success; the false positive, false negative and misclassification rates found are low, less than 0.1%, for most reconnaissance attacks; they rise to about 6% for distributed highly stealthy attacks; the latter is a most challenging type of attack, which has been difficult to detect effectively until now. Thus, the RIDS system promises to provide an early warning by detecting the reconnaissance first phase of an impending attack, even if it is very stealthy and distributed.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437816","","Data security;Ethernet networks;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Prototypes;Reconnaissance;Senior members;Student members;System testing","security of data;system monitoring","alert correlation;anomaly detection;distributed stealthy reconnaissance attack;reconnaissance intrusion detection system;session oriented statistical tool","","0","","13","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
