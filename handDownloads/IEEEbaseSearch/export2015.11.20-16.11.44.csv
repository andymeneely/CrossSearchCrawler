We propose a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) which detects intrusion from outside the network segment as well as from inside using mobile agents. The proposed model consists of three major components: Intrusion Detection Component, Mobile Agent Environment, Data Analysis Component and distributed sensors residing on every device in the network segment. Compared with traditional central sniffing IDS techniques, the system shows superior performances and saves network resources.","","978-1-4244-4132-7","978-1-4244-4134-1","10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305477","","Application software;Computer vision;Data analysis;Data security;Educational technology;Intelligent agent;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Network servers","data analysis;distributed sensors;mobile agents;security of data","IDS;data analysis component;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed sensor;mobile agent;sniffer tool","","0","","19","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Decompression-free inspection: DPI for shared dictionary compression over HTTP","Bremler-Barr, A.; David, S.T.; Hay, D.; Koral, Y.","Interdiscipl. Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE","20120510","2012","","","1987","1995","Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576","","Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers","Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols","Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression","","2","","25","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4577-1704-8","978-1-4577-1702-4","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","11","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NextGen will greatly increase the NAS capacity, efficiency, safety, flexibility, and environmental protection. Aviation Security is one of the core components in NextGen. Without security protection, all NextGen functions will be vulnerable to various attacks and cannot work robustly. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Aviation Security (IAS) framework for defense-in-depth of various aspects of NextGen security such as cyber security and aircraft anti-hijacking. IAS uses a multi-layered, cross-component, and multi-planed (data plane and control plane) structure. Multiple components in NextGen such as communication, navigation, surveillance, air traffic management, aircraft anti-hijacking, access control, biometrics, risk analysis and management, etc, are processed integratedly through information fusion to enhance the security performance of each module. We will present a detailed implementation approach of IAS including the AlertEnterprise based Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Model, defense-in-depth of communication, navigation, surveillance, and aircraft anti-hijacking.

To this end, summarized network connections from the DARPA 98 Lincoln Labs dataset are employed for training and testing a data driven learning architecture. The learning architecture is composed from a hierarchy of self-organizing feature maps. Such a scheme is entirely unsupervised, thus the quality of the intrusion detection system is directly influenced by the quality of the dataset. Dataset biases are investigated through three different dataset partitions: 10% KDD (default training dataset); normal connections alone; 50/50 mix of attack and normal.

By several binary-class hyper-planes, the zones of the inhomogeneous samples are divided, and the multi-category incremental learning is realized. Using this algorithm, the quantity of training samples is reduced while high detection rate is ensured at the same time. The test of the algorithm is based on the KDDCUP99 dataset.

In many ways outdoor security sensor technology can be described as “Slow-Tech” in a “High-Tech” world. In “High-Tech” we can expect a new product every few months with product lifetimes of one to two years. In the “Slow-Tech” world of outdoor security it typically takes two to three years to develop a new product and another two to three years to get the product approved by the user community. Fortunately once approved these products have a lifetime of ten to twenty years. The Carnahan Conference has provided an important venue for the introduction of new sensor technologies as they emerge from R&D, are tested by various agencies, and are introduced into the “real world” of outdoor security. The harsh realities of the outdoor environment and the wide range of threats faced by these sensors provide many challenges that have been the topic of many of the learned papers. The Carnahan conference provides an opportunity for the users of the technology to relate their experience to those who wish to introduce new technologies. Through the sponsorship of the IEEE these papers form a unique point of reference for the development of new sensors. Forty years ago most of the important players were large aerospace companies. Many of the sensor technologies used in perimeter security evolved from military developments. As one of the dominant users of perimeter security equipment, the US military sponsored much of this early development. This “mil-spec” environment had a profound effect on these developments which in many cases has survived to this day and is part of the heritage of the present world on outdoor perimeter security. These companies gave way to a number of small “spin-off” one product co- panies where the technologies were exploited. More recently most of one product companies have merged into larger “one-stop-shopping” companies. This paper describes the many changes in technology, the business models and the user community over the past 40 years and concludes with a prediction as to what the next 10 years will bring.","1071-6572","978-1-4673-2450-2","978-1-4673-2449-6","10.1109/CCST.2012.6393530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393530","","Companies;Government;Industries;Military aircraft;Security;Sensor systems","military equipment;national security;sensors","Carnahan Conference;IEEE sponsorship;US military;VIP residents;aerospace companies;business models;critical assets;forty year perspective;high-tech world;mil-spec environment;military developments;one-stop-shopping companies;outdoor environment;outdoor perimeter security sensors;perimeter security equipment;sensor technology;slow-tech world;threats;user community","","0","","13","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While techniques such as cryptographic methods, intrusion detection, and traditional fault tolerance are currently being used to improve the survivability of such systems, new approaches are needed to help reach the levels that will be required in the near future. This paper proposes the use of fine-grain customization and dynamic adaptation as key enabling technologies in a new approach designed to achieve this goal. Customization not only supports software diversity, but also allows customized tradeoffs to be made between different QoS attributes including performance, security, reliability and survivability. Dynamic adaptation allows survivable services to change their behavior at runtime as a reaction to anticipated or detected intrusions or failures. The Cactus system provides support for both fine-grain customization and dynamic adaptation, thereby offering a potential solution for building survivable software in networked systems","","0-7695-0490-6","","10.1109/DISCEX.2000.825033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=825033","","Accidents;Computer errors;Computer science;Cryptography;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Runtime;Safety;Web and internet services","security of data;software fault tolerance;system recovery","Cactus approach;adaptability;cryptographic methods;dynamic adaptation;fine-grain customization;intrusion detection;networked systems;performance;security;software diversity;software fault tolerance;software reliability;survivability;system failure","","11","","62","","","2000","25 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, AID techniques suffer from higher false alarm rate compared to signature-based intrusion detection techniques. In this paper, the concept of intrusion context identification is introduced to address the problem. The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis. Finally, based on the identified intrusion context and the efficiency comparison, several findings are made which can offer useful insights and benefit future research on AID techniques.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377216","","Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Filters;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sensor fusion;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data","anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques;false alarm rate;intrusion context identification;intrusive datasets;system calls trace;visualized anomalies","","1","","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proper scheduling policies can improve system capability without requiring additional resources. LAS, a size-based scheduling policy which can achieve optimal mean response time by giving preferential analysis to short flows, is widely used in various aspects of network field. Due to the high variability property of Internet traffic, LAS favors short flows without penalizing large flows very much. Unfortunately, the inspection of large flows can not be guaranteed in those network intrusion detection systems on 10Gbps links, which are usually heavily loaded, or even overloaded. Although tiny in percentage, large flows comprise more than 50% of the total load, and therefore can not be ignored, especially when specified by users as critical. How to avoid starving large flows while still giving higher priority to short flows is a dilemma we have to face in practice. In this paper, we propose a QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy (QTL), which can remedy LAS' defect. The experimental results show that our QTL scheduling policy has approximately the same performance as LAS for short flows, and meanwhile exhibits greatly enhanced processing capability for large flows.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7754-8","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546727","LAS;QoS-supported three-level scheduling (QTL);marked large flows;threat detection latency;threat loss rate","Inspection;Intrusion detection;Quality of service;Queueing analysis;Scheduling;Time factors","Internet;quality of service;queueing theory;scheduling;security of data","Internet traffic;LAS;QTL;QoS-supported three-level scheduling policy;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;network intrusion detection system;network security monitoring","","0","","21","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, a multi-layer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system is designed and developed to achieve high efficiency and improve the detection and classification rate accuracy inspired by immune systems with negative selection approach. In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers. The obtained results demonstrated that naive bayes classifier has better classification accuracy in the case of lower presented attacks such as U2R and R2L, while the J48 decision tree classifier gives high accuracy up to 82% for DoS attacks and 65.4% for probe attacks in the anomaly traffic.","","978-1-4799-2438-7","","10.1109/HIS.2013.6920485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920485","Artificial Immune System;Intrusion Classification;Machine Learning;Network Intrusion Detection","Niobium;Probes","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;principal component analysis;telecommunication traffic","DoS attacks;IDS;J48 decision tree classifier;NSL-KDD benchmark data set;PCA algorithm;R2L;U2R;anomalies detection;anomalous traffic;anomaly detectors;classification approach;feature selection;genetic algorithm;immune systems;multilayer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron neural network;naive Bayes classifier;negative selection approach;normal traffic;principal component analysis algorithm;probe attacks","","1","","25","","","4-6 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The AIIDA-SQL agent incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) engine which is equipped with learning and adaptation capabilities for the classification of SQL queries and detection of malicious user requests. To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle. This strategy enables to classify the received SQL queries in a reliable way. Finally, a projection neural technique is incorporated, which notably eases the revision stage carried out by human experts in the case of suspicious queries. The experimental results obtained on a real-traffic case study show that AIIDA-SQL performs remarkably well in practice.","","978-1-4244-7363-2","","10.1109/HIS.2010.5600026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5600026","Agent;Artificial Neural Network;Case-Based Reasoning;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection;Support Vector Machine","Artificial neural networks;Book reviews;Classification algorithms;Cognition;Databases;Humans;Support vector machines","SQL;case-based reasoning;neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","AIIDA-SQL agent;CBR engine;SQL injection attack detecting;SQL queries classification;adaptive intelligent intrusion detector agent;artificial neuronal network;case-based reasoning engine;information security;malicious user requests detection;projection neural technique;support vector machine;web applications","","1","","18","","","23-25 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Single sign on (SSO) provides a convenient facility for managing user authentication such that a user only logs into a system once in order to gain access to many protected applications. For this reason it becomes vitally important to secure the SSO server. If an SSO server is compromised, it could potentially put many applications at risk at the same time. The current Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems have proven to be inadequate because the “bad guys” are always one step ahead. In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to SSO server security called “Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance SSO” (SCIT). SCIT shifts the focus from detection and prevention to containing losses, by reducing the exposure time of the servers. Specifically, we present the results of an evaluation of the performance of a SCIT-ized SSO server. In this way we increase the dependability of the server and provide a new way to balance the trade-off between security and availability. We will show that SCIT provides increased security with little degradation in overall response time of the system.","","978-1-4244-7530-8","","10.1109/DEPEND.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562840","SCIT;central authentication service;exposure time;persistence;pro-active;response time;single sign on;virtualization;vmware","Authentication;Browsers;Degradation;Servers;Time factors;Virtual machining","message authentication","IT systems;SSO server;distributed systems;intrusion detection;prevention systems;self cleansing intrusion tolerance SSO;server dependability;single sign on server protection;user authentication","","1","","16","","","18-25 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect and reduce those misbehaviors, numerous trust management schemes have been proposed for MANETs. To effectively set up MANET, security is one of the main challenges that must be undertaken. The weight based clustering approach is based on combined weight metric that takes into account of several system parameters like the mobility, degree difference, transmission range and battery power of the node. One way to support efficient communication between nodes is to partition ad hoc networks into clusters. Various clustering schemes have been proposed to form clusters. Proposed IWCA algorithm can enhance the trust of cluster formation followed by malicious node removal from cluster head or member selection.","2151-7681","978-1-4673-5997-9","","10.1109/WOCN.2013.6616243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616243","malicious node;packet drop ratio;packet misroute rate;packet modified rate","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Wireless communication","fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern clustering;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology","IWCA;MANET;dynamic network topology;fault tolerance;improved weighted clustering algorithm;malicious node removal;mobile ad-hoc network;network resource lifetime;numerous trust management scheme;radio transmitter","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We believe that a case-based reasoning approach can provide a framework in which to incorporate more sophisticated artificial intelligence techniques that will help overcome some of these limitations. In addition, the present system is intended to apply more generally to other aspects of network security, as well as other domains related to protecting the nation's critical infrastructure.

Consequently, it is difficult for administrators to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. Several alert correlation methods have been proposed. However, these methods don't consider the differences in reliability among alerts reported from multiple IDSs. This paper presents a novel alert correlation approach based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which regards the alerts as evidence of network attack and combines all the evidence according to the Dempster's combination rule, inferring whether the attack has taken place. The main advantage of the approach is that it can eliminate the ambiguity and confliction in alerts and reduce the number of alerts. With the DARPA 2000 test dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the approach can reduce more than 69% of reported alerts and decrease the false positive rate efficiently.","","978-1-4244-1009-5","978-1-4244-1009-5","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469406","D-S evidence theory;alert correlation;intrsion detection system;network security","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Correlation;Data security;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protection;Testing","computer networks;correlation methods;security of data;telecommunication security","Dempste combination rule;Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;intrusion alert correlation method;intrusion detection systems;network attack","","3","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the features selection is an important issue in intrusion detection. Reducing the features set improves the system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing phases considerably. In this paper, we improve the Enhancing Support Vector Decision Function (ESVDF) approach by integrate it with a fuzzy inferencing model. The fuzzy inferencing model is used to accommodate the learning approximation and the small differences in the decision making steps of the ESVDF approach. It simplifies the design complexity and reduces the execution time of the ESVDF, which speeds up the features selection processing and facilitates any modification or changes in the features selection process that may happen later. In addition, it improves the overall performance of the ESVDF. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can deliver a satisfactory performance in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing time.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-4000-9","978-0-7695-3638-5","10.1109/AINA.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076245","","Computer networks;Computer vision;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","approximation theory;decision making;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","decision making;enhancing support vector decision function;feature set reduction;features selection;fuzzy ESVDF approach;fuzzy inference model;intrusion detection system;machine learning approximation;testing phase;training phase","","3","","28","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first vital step in dealing with this problem is the network's ability to detect such attacks. To that end, it is important that an intrusion detection mechanism be able to differentiate between real DDoS traffic and Flash Crowds traffic, the latter of which constitutes sudden bursts of legitimate network activity. To train and analyze detection mechanisms, researchers typically simulate the DDoS traffic in the testbed; while for Flash Crowds, most researchers replay the web server captures obtained from third parties. This paper proposes the design of a special testbed-based simulation method with Spirent Test Center hardware platform, to simulate both DDoS traffic and Flash Crowds traffic.

In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations.

Due to resource constraints, the IDS can only choose K (K <; N) components to probe at each time. An abnormal component incurs a cost per unit time (depending on the criticality of the component) until it is probed and fixed.

The key concept of our redundancy management is to exploit the tradeoff between energy consumption vs. the gain in reliability, timeliness, and security to maximize the system useful lifetime. We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized. We then apply the analysis results obtained to the design of a dynamic redundancy management algorithm to identify and apply the best design parameter settings at runtime in response to environment changes, to maximize the HWSN lifetime.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.043013.120282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514999","Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;intrusion detection;multipath routing;reliability;security","Energy conservation;Intrusion detection;Multipath channels;Network sensors;Routing protocls;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor management","energy consumption;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","HWSN;dynamic redundancy management algorithm;energy consumption;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intrusion tolerance;multipath routing;optimization problem;query response success probability;security;voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm","","4","","40","","2013-05-13","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There is a growing need for systems that allow not only the detection of complex attacks, but after the fact understanding of what happened. This could be used in a forensic sense or simply as a managerial tool to recover and repair damaged systems. There are few network systems that support forensic evidence collection and the current systems also lack effective attack attribution.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient IDS by selecting relevant futures from NSL-KDD dataset and using Logistic Regression (LR) based classifier. To decrease memory space and learning time, a feature selection method is required. In this paper we have selected a number of feature sets, using the approach of Genetic Algorithm (GA), with our proposed fitness score based on Mutual Correlation. From the number of feature sets, we have selected the fittest set of features using our proposed Best Feature Set Selection (BFSS) method. After selecting the most relevant features from NSL-KDD data set, we used LR based classification. Thus, an efficient IDS is created by applying the concept of GA with BFSS for feature selection and LR for classification to detect network intrusions.","","978-1-4799-4446-0","","10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060117","BFSS;GA;Gradient Descent;IDS;LR;Mutual Correlation;NSL-KDD","Biological cells;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Sociology;Statistics;Training","feature selection;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;regression analysis;security of data","BFSS;GA;IDS;LR classifier;best feature set selection method;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system;logistic regression;mutual correlation","","0","","19","","","7-8 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, traffic is getting more concentrated to points such as data centers, and demand for protecting such high-speed networks from attack traffic is increasing. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) with Regular Expression (RegEx) detection is the de facto defense mechanism agains network intrusions. However, current RegEx detection systems cannot keep up with the upcoming high-speed line rate. The RegExes consist of three types of components, exact strings, character classes (CC), and repetitions. Exact string and repetition matching have been widely studied by RegEx research community for better performance. Yet, although more than 55% of RegExes in Snort signature set contain at least one CC, hardware based solutions that focus on CC detection is limited. In this paper we propose a new CC detection architecture called Range Hash that is suitable for high-speed, compact CC detection. Additionally, we propose a practical application of the Range Hash architecture where it can be used as a pre-filter for a Regular Expression detection system to increase overall RegEx detection performance. Based on our hardware prototype design which runs at 250MHz, Range Hash can reach to 100-Gbps CC detection throughput with today's FPGA chips.","","978-1-4244-9127-8","978-1-4503-0379-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623834","Deep Packet Inspection;FPGA;Network Intrusion Detection System;Pre-Filter;Range Hash;Range Matching;Regular Expressions","Complexity theory;Computer aided manufacturing;Data structures;Detectors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Throughput","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","FPGA chips;Internet carriers;Internet traffic demands;Snort signature;character classes;data centers;deep packet inspection;exact strings;high-speed backbone network testing;network intrusions;range hash architecture;regular expression detection;regular expression prefiltering;repetition matching","","2","","45","","","25-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By the abilities of classification and clustering analysis of the above methods, IIDS can be adapted to both anomaly and misuse detections for intrusive outsiders. The training stage is a mixture of supervised manner and unsupervised one. Furthermore, IIDS uses the buffering and spoofing principles of address resolution protocol (ARP) to capture and refuse the insider intruders trying to log on a local area network (LAN). Therefore, IIDS is able to detect the intrusions/attacks both from the outer Internet and an inner LAN.

Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities. We define criteria and analyse these variations with complexity (time and space) and output to the original DBSCAN algorithm. We also compare these variations with one another to select the efficient algorithm. In most of the variations partitioning and hybrid methodologies are originated to deal DBSCAN problems.

We present a mechanism to split traffic to different intrusion detection sensors (e.g., SNORT based sensors) to make the task manageable. This splitting of traffic to each sensor is managed by policies enforced on the splitter by the management console. The system is adaptive in the sense that it can adjust the splitting policies for keeping load disparity among sensors reduced. This mechanism of policy-reloading also take into account the similarity between all possible pairs of policies and tries to minimize the packet duplication rate during the operation of the system. Our mechanism is based on the observation that minimizing the percentage of traffic being duplicated can enhance system performance. We also discuss the effects of the reloading of splitting policies on packet duplication rate and on the load on the sensors.","","0-7803-8325-7","","10.1109/INCC.2004.1366575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1366575","","Adaptive systems;Educational institutions;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Scalability;Sensor systems;Statistics;System performance;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;SNORT intrusion detection system;adaptive load balancing architecture;load disparity;management console;multi sensor intrusion detection systems;packet duplication rate minimization;traffic splitting policies","","0","","8","","","11-13 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VMSoar can understand users' activities because it is capable of performing these activities itself. It knows how to perform both legal and illegal activities, and uses this knowledge to explore simulations of the activity on a network. It can also probe information stored on a machine to assess the legality of past activity. Research in cybersecurity is difficult is due to the extremely large amount of data that must be analyzed to detect illegal activities. In addition, new exploits are developed frequently. Most current projects in this area are attempting to build some level of intelligence into their systems; however, those projects are focusing primarily on statistical data mining approaches. The VMSoar project is unique in its approach to building an intelligent security agent.

Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4","","10.1109/IPSN.2006.244130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network. From the experiments with an open-source MapReduce system, Hadoop, we have verified that the MapReduce-based flow analysis method improves the flow statistics computation time by 72%, when compared with the popular flow data processing tool, flow-tools, on a single host. In addition, we showed that MapReduce-based programs complete the flow analysis job against a single node failure.","","978-1-4244-6037-3","","10.1109/NOMSW.2010.5486551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486551","Hadoop;MapReduce;NetFlow;cloud computing;traffic monitoring","Cloud computing;Fluid flow measurement;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Statistical distributions;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;network servers;parallel processing;public domain software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Hadoop;Internet flow analysis method;Internet traffic measurement;MapReduce software framework;cloud computing platform;cluster filesystem;coarse traffic statistics;distributed parallel processing schemes;flow aggregation;flow statistics;flow traces;high performance server;open-source MapReduce system;packet sampling;packet traces;traffic data monitoring","","23","","15","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the industry wide adaptation of service-oriented architecture (SOA), web services have become an integral component of enterprise software eco-system, resulting in new security challenges. Web services are strategic components used by wide variety of organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. The public deployments of mission critical APIs opens up possibility of software bugs to be maliciously exploited. Therefore, vulnerability identification in web services through static as well as dynamic analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia, national security and industry. Using OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) web services guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards, and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by detecting vulnerabilities. Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant. In this paper we provide an overview of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for web services, and discuss the potential static code analysis techniques to discover these vulnerabilities.

In this network, the sensors are associated with different groups, based on their functional types and after deployment they collaborate with one another in the same group for doing any assigned task for that particular group. We term this sort of DSN as a heterogeneous distributed sensor network (HDSN). Considering this scenario, we propose a secure membership verification mechanism using one-way accumulator (OWA) which ensures that, before collaborating for a particular task, any pair of nodes in the same deployment group can verify each other's legitimacy of membership. Our scheme also supports addition and deletion of members (nodes) in a particular group in the HDSN. Our analysis shows that, the proposed scheme could work well in conjunction with other security mechanisms for sensor networks and is very effective to resist any adversary's attempt to be included in a legitimate group in the network.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455133","Group;One Way Accumulator;Security;Sensor","Computer networks;Data security;Electronic mail;Mission critical systems;Monitoring;Object detection;Open wireless architecture;Surveillance;Target tracking;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections. Finally, we compare the alerts produced by different malware families and highlight key differences in their volume, aliveness, fanout, and severity.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901257","Intrusion detection;alert correlation;malware;malware measurements;snort","Grippers;Image edge detection;Monitoring;Servers;Trojan horses","invasive software","EDGe;ETH Zurich campus network;IDS alert correlation;Snort IDS;extrusion detection guard;intrusion detection systems;malware","","0","","36","","2014-09-17","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we illustrate our progress with a Software-defined Cloud-Gateway automation system using OpenFlow. In addition, based on our deployment experience, we highlight two technical challenges when using OpenFlow. First, with the standardization being an evolving effort, we highlight some of the programming challenges and missing features within the OpenFlow protocol. Secondly, existing OpenFlow-based network stack lacks some architectural components that reduces the level of flexibility we achieve when programming the network. Most SDN controllers expose limited abstractions to build network applications thereby primarily functioning as an OpenFlow driver. This imposes an application programmer to work with several OpenFlow primitives. To address this problem, we elaborate our current work in extending the SDN stack to improve our overall network programmability experience.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2013.6710582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6710582","Cloud Networking;Network Programmability;OpenFlow;Service Provider;Software-defined Networks;VPN","Libraries;Logic gates;Programming;Quality of service;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;internetworking;protocols","OpenFlow driver;OpenFlow protocol;SDN controllers;network visibility;overall network programmability experience;software defined cloud-gateway automation system;software-defined networks;vendor dependency","","1","","27","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main cause for false alert generation is either, technique fails to differentiate an outlier from a genuine cluster point or the features extracted fail to separate the two classes.

What are the steps that should be taken to increase the level of security? What can be done to better protect against incident or malicious activity? How can attacks, or incidents, be more easily discovered? What actions should be taken in the event of an attack? How can information systems be returned to normal operating activity following a disaster? To arrive at simple answers adapted to the context of the organisation, it is recommended that a rigorous approach be adopted. One can respond to these questions by developing a model.

In this paper, we proposed an approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune system (AIS), called GAAIS, for dynamic intrusion detection in AODV-based MANETs. GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic. The performance of GAAIS is evaluated for detecting several types of routing attacks simulated using the NS2 simulator, such as Flooding, Blackhole, Neighbor, Rushing, and Wormhole.

Organization cannot afford any kinds of attacks on their confidential information and resources either from insiders or out-siders. The damage done by insiders is more severe than that of external attackers due to their knowledge about the system and potential targets. It has been observed by studying previous case studies of insider attacks that insiders usually get involve in some unusual or suspicious activities prior to launching actual attacks. So observing these kinds of activities and taking proper actions in time may help to avoid such kinds of attacks. In this paper a risk assessment methodology has been presented to compute the threat levels of insiders. Appropriate actions may be taken by knowing about the threat level of each user in order to avoid actual attacks. The methodology not only incorporates technical measures but also some psychological indicators to detect insiders. The difference of this methodology from the previous ones is that it provides a practical way of quantization of risks for insider threats. The methodology is simulated in a test network against different scenarios and results showed that it efficiently categorized users according to their threat level. So it provides a base to deploy non uniform security policies among the users thus reducing overall processing overheads.","","978-1-4799-7504-4","","10.1109/FIT.2014.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118395","Insider;Organization;Risk;psychological;threat","Computers;Distance measurement;Monitoring;Organizations;Psychology;Security;Software","psychology;security of data","information misuse;insider threat;nonuniform security policy;psychological indicator;risk assessment","","0","","13","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Comparative study of Principal Component Analysis based Intrusion Detection approach using machine learning algorithms","Chabathula, K.J.; Jaidhar, C.D.; Ajay Kumara, M.A.","Dept. of IT, NITK Surathkal, Mangalore, India","Signal Processing, Communication and Networking (ICSCN), 2015 3rd International Conference on","20150827","2015","","","1","6","This paper induces the prominence of variegated machine learning techniques adapted so far for the identifying different network attacks and suggests a preferable Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the available system resources while optimizing the speed and accuracy. With booming number of intruders and hackers in todays vast and sophisticated computerized world, it is unceasingly challenging to identify unknown attacks in promising time with no false positive and no false negative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm. Obtained results demonstrates detection accuracy, computational efficiency with minimal false alarms, less system resources utilization. Experimental results are compared with respect to detection rate and detection time and found that TREE classification algorithms achieved superior results over other algorithms. The whole experiment is conducted by using KDD99 data set.","","978-1-4673-6822-3","","10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219853","Intrusion Detection Systems;Machine Learning Algorithms;Principal Component Analysis","Accuracy;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Support vector machines;Vegetation","computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis","Adaboost algorihm;IDS;J48 tree algorithm;KNN;PCA;SVM;hackers;higher dimension dataset;intruders;intrusion detection approach;intrusion detection system;k-nearest neighbors;lower dimension dataset;machine learning algorithms;naive Bayes probabilistic classifier;nearest neighbors generalized exemplars algorithm;network attacks;network packet header;principal component analysis;random forest tree classification algorithm;support vector machines;system resources;voting features interval classification algorithm","","0","","19","","","26-28 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such, packets with low causal relations to attacks can be dropped or ignored and/or packets with high causal relations to attacks are to be highlighted.

The focus of this paper is to generate the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) detection dataset and detect them using the Enhanced Support Vector Machines. The DDoS dataset with various direct and derived attributes is generated in an experimental testbed which has 14 attributes and 10 types of latest DDoS attack classes. Using the generated DDoS dataset the Enhanced Multi Class Support Vector Machines (EMCSVM) is used for detection of the attacks into various classes. The performance of the EMCSVM is evaluated over SVM with various parameter values and kernel functions. It is inferred that EMCSVM produces better classification rate for the DDoS dataset with ten types of latest DDoS attacks when compared with the kddcup 99 dataset which has six types of DoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-0670-6","","10.1109/ICoAC.2011.6165212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165212","Classification rate;DDoS dataset;Enhanced Multi Class Support Vector Machines (EMCSVM);Intrusion Detection Dataset","Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Servers;Support vector machines;Training","computer network security;data mining;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence)","DDoS attack detection;data mining techniques;detection rate;distributed denial of service detection dataset;enhanced multiclass support vector machines;kddcup 99 dataset;kernel functions;machine learning;network intrusion detection system;parameter values;real time generated dataset","","1","","16","","","14-16 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper propose an agent-based multicast routing scheme like On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) which can be more suitable for Ad Hoc network but D-ODMRP Destination driven On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol is used to reduce the number of nodes to be added in the forwarding group. D-ODMRP introduces the features into the existing on demand process of multicast forwarding structure in MANET that builds a backbone in the form of a reliable mesh and finds multicast routes. Mobile autonomous agent technique for intrusion detection system in MANET has been proposed where agents are fired from a source node which traverses each node randomly and detect the malicious node. The link failure are detected and repaired by nearby nodes. This paper illustrate three types of performance analysis they are packet delivery ratio against number of multicast group, power consumption of nodes verses number of nodes & network area verses no of nodes and found that proposed system is better.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950182","D-ODMRP;IDS;MA;MANET;ODMRP","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Protocols;Reliability;Routing","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication links","D-ODMRP;MANET;agent-based multicast routing scheme;destination driven on-demand multicast routing protocol;intrusion detection system;link failures;malicious node detection;mobile ad hoc network;mobile autonomous agent technique;mobility conditions;multicast forwarding structure;multicast routes;node failures","","0","","8","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our study shows that, given adequate management, the core virtualization technology has a clear positive effect on availability, but that the effect on confidentiality and integrity is less positive.Virtualized systems tend to lose the properties of location-boundedness, uniqueness and monotonicity.In order to ensure corporate and private data security, we propose to either remove or tightly manage non-essential features such as introspection, rollback and transfer.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283352","security;security properties;virtualization","Application software;Computer architecture;Data security;Hardware;Information security;Information systems;Load management;Platform virtualization;Virtual machine monitors;Voice mail","data privacy;security of data","adequate management;core virtualization technology;private data security;server virtualization","","6","1","31","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
