Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (""invariants""). These invariants are associated with conditions (the ""observed variables"") of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network. We construct a prototype to demonstrate the benefit of run-time detection and correction","","0-7695-2553-9","","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636206","","Aggregates;Application software;Bandwidth;Error correction;Face detection;Fault detection;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Runtime;Wireless sensor networks","computer debugging;error correction;error detection;fault diagnosis;protocols;system recovery;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","H-SEND;fault diagnosis;hierarchical sensor network debugging;observation channel;protocol;semiautomatic approach;software error detection;wireless network","","3","","31","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the basic SIP specifications do not require the proxy servers to track the states of established sessions, an extension header field ""Session-Expires"" has been proposed for SIP to allow the proxy server to hold resources for established sessions just within the specified periods. In this paper, we identify a novel denial of service (DoS) attack utilizing this SIP extension to drain resources of the proxy servers in wireless VoIP. In particular, by deliberately setting a large value of the ""Session-Expires'' header and then physically disconnecting from the wireless network, attackers can repeatedly hold resources of the proxy server as long as they want. Also, the low-volume nature of the attack allows it to avoid being detected by existing volume-based intrusion detection systems. As a counter-measure, we propose a robust detection scheme based on the statistical Anderson-Darling test. The key insight that leads to the scheme is the changed statistical property of the header values induced by the attack. We validate the performance through computer simulation. The scheme shows its ability to detect the attack and is even more effective when applied against the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684028","","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Robustness;Servers;Wireless networks","Internet telephony;signalling protocols;statistical testing;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;SIP-based wireless VoIP network;Session Initiation Protocol;attack detection;distributed denial of service attack;proxy server;resource-drained attack;session control;session management;session-expires;statistical Anderson-Darling test;statistical property;volume-based intrusion detection system","","2","","12","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a technique of applying artificial immune system along with genetic algorithm to develop an intrusion detection system. Far from developing primary immune response, as most of the related works do, it attempts to evolve this primary immune response to a secondary immune response using the concept of memory cells prevalent in natural immune systems. A genetic algorithm using genetic operators- selection, cloning, crossover and mutation- facilitates this. Memory cells formed enable faster detection of already encountered attacks. These memory cells, being highly random in nature, are dependent on the evolution of the detectors and guarantee greater immunity from anomalies and attacks. The fact that the whole procedure is enveloped in the concepts of approximate binding and memory cells of lightweight of natural immune systems makes this system reliable, robust and quick responding.","","978-0-7695-3184-7","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557836","artificial immune system;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system","Artificial immune systems;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer science;Detectors;Gene expression;Genetic algorithms;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Phase detection","genetic algorithms;security of data","anomaly detection;artificial immune system;computer networks;evolution induced secondary immunity;genetic algorithm;genetic operators;intrusion detection system;memory cells;natural immune systems;primary immune response;secondary immune response","","5","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The advent of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) and autonomous aircraft represents a unique opportunity to allow for rapid response, while minimizing the cost of deployment and increasing reliability and operator safety. This paper describes the key challenges to implement fault-tolerant and efficient deployments of collaborative autonomous aircraft to increase operational reliability and performance when performing aerial sensing and assessment. Some challenges are introduced by mobility, such as wireless communication, group navigation, and data collection. Security also represents a challenge during the operation of the MANET. We consider the effects of limited resources (e.g., real-time processing power, battery packs) available on the aircraft. By understanding both the application context and the resource availability, networked aircraft can reorganize to ensure resiliency for the mission if a resource failure occurs within the network.","","978-1-4673-5287-1","978-1-4673-5286-4","10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504199","Energy efficiency;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad-hoc networks;Robust and secure wireless communication;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","Aircraft;Aircraft navigation;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Routing;Security","aircraft communication;cost reduction;disasters;fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","MANET aerial communication;aerial assessment performance;aerial sensing performance;autonomous aircraft deployment;cost minimization;data collection;fault-tolerant;group navigation;mobile ad-hoc network;natural disaster;operational reliability;operator safety;radio receiver;real-time processing power;resource availability;resource failure network;search-rescue application;security;transportation infrastructure;wireless communication","","2","","23","","","28-31 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this problem, we propose a system whereby the system can detect whether the current user is the authorized user, a substitute user or an intruder pretending to be a valid user. Therefore the system checks the identity of the user by their behaviour pattern using keystrokes dynamics to authenticate user. A number of samples of login and password attempts of each user is gathered and stored in a database. From the samples collected, keystroke patterns are derived called feature sets and signatures are formed for each user using Fuzzy Logic algorithms. Once signatures are formed, users are authenticated by comparing their typing pattern to the respective signatures formed. We study the performance of such a system based on features like False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR), thus evaluating the efficiency of the system.","","","","10.1109/ICTSD.2015.7095873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095873","Keystroke dynamics;biometrics;computer security;continuous authentication system;continuous biometric authentication;feature selection;intrusion detection;user typing behaviour;user-independent threshold","Computers;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Standards;Sustainable development;Timing","authorisation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;message authentication","FAR;FRR;false acceptance rate;false rejection rate;feature sets;fuzzy logic membership function;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;typing pattern;user authentication","","0","","6","","","4-6 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cyber attacks could block the connection between SCADA Control Centre and its remote devices or insert fake commands and/or measurements in the equipment communications. With reference to an actual case study, constituted by a SCADA system controlling a portion of a medium voltage electrical grid and a corporate network, we investigate the use of modeling versus a hybrid test bed to conduct actual cyber attacks on SCADA and to analyze their consequences on SCADA and on the electrical grid. Modeling is in charge of predicting consequences of cyber attacks on SCADA and the electrical grid, while the test bed is in charge to reproduce cyber attacks and their propagation more realistically then modeling. The hybrid test bed is constituted by the coexistence of actual and simulated systems and devices of SCADA, corporate network and the electrical grid. The final hybrid test bed will include the most adequate models essentially to reproduce missing components such as the electrical grid and parts of corporate network and SCADA system.","","978-1-4799-3530-7","","10.1109/CCST.2014.6986997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986997","critical infrastructure protection;cyber attacks;electrical grid;interdependency analysis;scada","Circuit breakers;IP networks;Monitoring;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers;Substations","SCADA systems;computer network security;critical infrastructures;power engineering computing;power grids","ICT pervasiveness;SCADA control centre;catastrophic failures;corporate network;critical infrastructures;cyber attackers;cyber attacks;cyber security;equipment communications;information and communication technologies;medium voltage electrical grid;nervous system;remote devices;supervision control and data acquisition","","0","","13","","","13-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overhead network packets can greatly reduce the effectiveness of such detection systems and heavily consume computer resources. To mitigate this issue, a more efficient signature matching algorithm is desirable. In this paper, we therefore develop an adaptive character frequency-based exclusive signature matching scheme that can be implemented in a signature-based NIDS to help improve the performance of signature matching. In the experiment, we implemented our scheme in a distributed network environment and evaluated the performance of our scheme compared with Snort.

Both misuse (protocol analysis) and anomaly (statistical based) approaches are implemented as detection mechanisms in order to handle both known and unknown attacks. Four OSPF attacks (i.e., MaxSeq, MaxAge, Seq++, and LSID attacks) have been developed for evaluating JiNao's detecting capability. Furthermore, an SNMP based network management interface has been designed and implemented such that the JiNao IDS can be easily integrated with existing network management systems","","0-7695-0490-6","","10.1109/DISCEX.2000.821510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=821510","","Intrusion detection;Protection","Internet;computer network management;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","Internet;JiNao;anomaly approach;attack prevention;firewall;integrated network management;misuse approach;network infrastructure protection;open shortest path first routing protocol;scalable intrusion detection system;system architecture","","10","13","11","","","2000","25 Jan 2000-27 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the special infrastructure and communication mode, intrusion detection in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) is especially challenging and requires particular design considerations. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-1997-5","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489491","","Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Radar detection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless mesh networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anomalous mesh node detection;intrusion detection system;reactive routing protocol;reputation-based scheme;wireless mesh network","","6","","19","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of them have difficulties such as high dependency to predefined correlation rule definitions and domain knowledge, huge volume of computing workload in some cases and limited capability in discovering new attack scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a new alert correlation method to automatically extract multi-step attack scenarios. This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets. Our experiments show our approach can effectively construct multi-step attack scenarios and give high level view of intruder intentions.","","978-1-4244-9494-1","","10.1109/SYSCON.2011.5929072","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929072","Alert correlation;attack graph;multi-step attack","Correlation;Data mining;Humans;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Sensors","security of data","IDS generated alerts;alert correlation method;alert winnowing phase;automatic attack scenario;correlation rule definitions;domain knowledge;meta alerts;multiphase process;multistep attack graph;multistep attack scenarios","","1","1","26","","","4-7 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose in this work a new signal fingerprinting approach based on discrete wavelet transformer. Instead of being extracted from the transient part, the signal fingerprint is computed on a part of the signal related to the transmission of a definite sequence of bits. This sequence is expected to be transmitted by every base station antenna in the network.

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

A composite event involves multiple properties requiring different types of sensors to monitor. Considering the costs of different deployment of heterogeneous sensors and the total budget for a monitored region, this paper investigates the composite event coverage problem with the purpose of optimizing coverage quality subjecting to the constraint of not exceeding the total budget. This is a novel coverage problem which is different from the traditional ones where deployment costs of sensors, total budget and composite events are not considered. Two exact algorithms are proposed whose time complexities are O(n<sup>k</sup>) and O(n<sup>k-1</sup>) respectively in the worst case, and a (1 - e<sup>-1</sup>)-approximate algorithm are designed.

Even the cryptographic protocols, which are used to provide secure communication, are often targeted by diverse attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often employed to monitor network traffic and host activities that may lead to unauthorized accesses and attacks against vulnerable services. Most of the conventional misuse-based and anomaly-based IDSs are ineffective against attacks targeted at encrypted protocols since they heavily rely on inspecting the payload contents. To combat against attacks on encrypted protocols, we propose an anomaly-based detection system by using strategically distributed monitoring stubs (MSs). We have categorized various attacks against cryptographic protocols. The MSs, by sniffing the encrypted traffic, extract features for detecting these attacks and construct normal usage behavior profiles. Upon detecting suspicious activities due to the deviations from these normal profiles, the MSs notify the victim servers, which may then take necessary actions. In addition to detecting attacks, the MSs can also trace back the originating network of the attack. We call our unique approach DTRAB since it focuses on both Detection and TRAceBack in the MS level. The effectiveness of the proposed detection and traceback methods are verified through extensive simulations and Internet datasets.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2039492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392994","Computer security;encrypted protocol (cryptographic protocol);intrusion detection system (IDS)","","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","DTRAB approach;Internet;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based detection system;cryptographic protocols;detection-and-traceback approach;distributed monitoring stubs;encrypted protocols;intrusion detection systems;misuse-based IDS;network traffic;network-based applications;secure communication;traffic-feature analysis","","15","","42","","2010-01-19","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection algorithms and approaches are well-known. However, it is uncertain if these approaches are effective in a mobile ad-hoc environment where resources such as bandwidth are limited. To address this problem the Tactical Environment Assurance Laboratory (TEALab) was established to provide an environment for characterizing tactical battlefield ad-hoc networks experiencing intrusive behaviors.

These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms can deliver satisfactory results in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and testing time.","","978-1-4244-2308-8","978-1-4244-2309-5","10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784780","","Bit error rate;Computer crime;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines","ESVDF;backward elimination ranking;classification accuracy;enhanced support vector decision function;features ranking;features selection;forward selection ranking;intrusion detection systems;support vector machines;testing time;training time","","6","","40","","","10-13 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using results from published studies, we compare these four solutions against different requirements highlighting trade-offs in performance, space, attack resistance, and cost. We also present a case study of applying these solutions based on design work at NCSA.

Software functionality and security are tightly related to each other, vulnerabilities due to design errors, inconsistencies, incompleteness, and missing constraints in system specifications can be wrongly exploited by security attacks. These two concerns, however, are often handled separately. In this paper we present a threat driven approach that improves on the quality of software through the realization of a more secure functional model. The approach introduces systematic transformation rules and integration steps for mapping attack tree representations into lower level dynamic behavior, then integrates this behavior into state chart-based functional models. Through the focus on both the functional and threat behavior, software engineers can introduce, clearly define and understand security concerns as software is designed. To identify vulnerabilities, our approach then applies security analysis and threat identification to the integrated model.","","978-1-4577-0780-3","978-0-7695-4453-3","10.1109/SSIRI.2011.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5991998","Software security;attack trees;software design;statecharts;system modeling;threat modeling","Analytical models;HTML;Logic gates;Security;Semantics;Software;Unified modeling language","Internet;formal specification;safety-critical software;security of data;software quality","Internet;mapping attack tree representations;software functionality;software quality;software security;statechart-based functional models;system specifications;systematic transformation rules;threat driven approach;threat identification;untrustworthy computing;vulnerabilities","","2","","27","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events. IDSs with active probing are now being proposed for such attacks which involve sending of probe packets that cause difference in sequence of events under attack condition and can be then detected using passive monitoring.

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well.

Currently, packet analysis is provided by almost each ISP but it has a high impact in term of performance and energy consumption; this makes the choice of the optimal IDS strategy both a key and non-trivial issue. To this aim, IDS strategies have been deeply investigated in term of performance, while the assessment of the energy consumption is quite unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first attempt towards the assessment of the energy impact of security solutions.

A trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes while a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing to inner attacks. The previous work proposed two simple models along with trust computation methods to filter out black hole nodes using the benevolent ones and achieved better performance against pure black hole attacks. In this study, a method to prevent gray hole attack, one kind of black hole attack, which is more cunning and clandestine attack is proposed. The neighbour observing model based on watchdog concept is focused on the direct trust value (DTV) to detect single black hole attack. Historical evidence is also taken into consideration against gray hole attacks. Moreover, the neighbour recommendation model that companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to detect the cooperative black hole attacks. On the other hand, the proposed method tries to balance the trust values from different neighbour nodes to mitigate the damage by their deceiving. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attack.","1738-9445","978-1-4673-0150-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174693","Black hole attack;Direct trust value;Grey hole attack;Historical evidence;Indirect trust value;MANET;Trust management strategy","Bismuth;Cryptography;Digital TV;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nickel;Relays","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;trusted computing","MANET;cooperative black hole attack;gray hole attack;historical evidence based trust management strategy;indirect trust value;inner attack;neighbour observing model;neighbour recommendation model;watchdog concept","","4","","13","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RECLAMO is proposing a novel approach: diverting the attack to a specific honey net that has been dynamically built based on the attack information. Among all components forming the RECLAMO's architecture, this paper is mainly focused on defining a trust and reputation management model, essential to recognize if IDSs are exposing an honest behavior in order to accept their alerts as true.

In this paper, we propose a novel system placed at the network egress point that aims to efficiently and effectively detect APT malware infections based on malicious DNS and traffic analysis. The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together. Our experiment was performed at a large local institute network for two months, and all the features were studied with big data, which includes ~400 million DNS queries. Our security approach cannot only substantially reduce the volume of network traffic that needs to be recorded and analyzed but also improve the sustainability of the system.","2169-3536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2458581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163279","APT;DNS;intrusion detection;malware infections","Command and control systems;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Malware;Web servers","Big Data;Internet;digital signatures;invasive software;query processing","APT malware infection detection;Big Data;C&C servers;DNS query;IP address;Internet;advanced persistent threat;anomaly based detection technology;command and control server;feature vector;large local institute network;malicious DNS analysis techniques;network egress point;network traffic features;security approach;signature-based based detection technology;traffic analysis","","0","","28","","2015-07-20","2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It directly filters out IBR traffic from collected Net Flow data without specific configurations or building extra collection system. The key assumption of our approach is that the traffic source of normal users is relatively certain rather than random. The IBR traffic filtered by our approach also includes the part that sent to normal user hosts besides the traffic to unsigned IP, which is more valuable and practical to network security.","","978-1-4799-2140-9","","10.1109/EIDWT.2013.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6631648","Internet background radiation traffic;network measurement;relative uncertainty;traffic analysis","Educational institutions;Filtering theory;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring;Random variables;Uncertainty","Internet;computer network security;filtering theory;telecommunication traffic","IBR traffic detecting method;IBR traffic filtering method;Internet background radiation traffic;net flow data;network security;relative uncertainty theory","","0","","16","","","9-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although network devices in open flow can also be targeted by attackers and so required a prevention mechanism in order to avoid problems in smooth packet forwarding. In this research task we compose an Infrastructure based DoS attacking scenario over the software defined network and address the vulnerabilities in flow table, and afterward we developed a prevention mechanism to avoid such kind of attack in its initial stage before harming our network.

A mining engine discovers emergent threat profiles and delivers them to the fusion engine for processing. We describe the distributed nature of botnets and how they are created and managed. We then describe a combined fusion and mining model that builds on recent work in the cybersecurity domain. The framework we present employs an adaptive fusion system driven by a mining system focused on the discovery of new threats.

Existing network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has drawbacks in many aspects, among of which the two outstanding problems are the high ratio of false alarms and the lack of self-adaptation. The powerful information processing capabilities of the biological immune system, such as feature extraction, pattern recognition, learning, memory, and its distributive multi-layer defence mechanisms provide rich metaphors for designing a computer immune defence system. In this approach, the authors propose a novel multi-layer defence mechanisms based on immunity, which is capable of detecting and identifying both known and unknown intrusions, elaborating a specialized response measure. Besides that, the proposed defence mechanisms have the same learning and adaptive capability of the biological immune system, and so it is able to monitor networked computer's activities at different levels, and to improve its response under subsequent exposures to the same attack. This on-going research effort is not to mimic simply the immunology characteristics but to explore and learn valuable lessons useful for self-adaptive immune intrusion prevention systems.","","978-0-7695-3334-6","","10.1109/WGEC.2008.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4637445","Biological immune system;Computer immune system;Immunology;Intrusion detection system;Multi-layer defence mechanism;Network security","Biology computing;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Pathogens;Pattern recognition;Protection","adaptive systems;computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;monitoring;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","adaptive learning system;biological immune system;computer immune defence mechanism;computer network activity monitoring;multilayer network intrusion detection system;self-adaptive immune intrusion prevention system","","0","","13","","","25-26 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional security engineering approach attempts to secure the infrastructure: the hardware, the network and operating system, with the goal of preventing such attacks getting through to any application running on these platforms. We propose a. complementary approach that aims to ensure the applications' continued ability to provide useful service despite the ongoing attack(s). This approach, called defense-enabling, uses an adaptive middleware to coordinate services of multiple mechanisms that are not normally part of the application's functional objectives. Defense-enabling an application involves focusing on a set of attacks, developing a strategy to defend against these attacks and systematically incorporating the strategy in the application. The topic of this paper is the technology underlying the concept. We show how services of various mechanisms, organized and coordinated by an adaptive middleware, support the implementation of an application's defense strategy. We believe that the increased resilience obtained by defense-enabling would be significant for critical military applications.","","0-7803-7225-5","","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985770","","Application software;Contracts;Filtering;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Middleware;Operating systems;Resilience;Security;Technology management","adaptive systems;distributed object management;military communication;military computing;network operating systems;security of data;telecommunication security","CORBA;adaptive middleware;attacks;computer systems intrusion;defense-enabling concept;distributed applications;distributed object computing;hardware security;military applications;network security;operating system;security engineering","","7","","31","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
