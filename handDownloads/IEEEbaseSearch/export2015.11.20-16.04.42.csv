These causes an authorized services deny from user. Thus poses a major security threat in network. The mitigation of denial of service become hard when it comes to distributed environment. Denial of service can be of any form either ping of death or clone attack. In existing system these can be overcome using filtering technique namely blackhole and sinkhole. Filtering malicious traffic can be integrated with firewall hardware or software. Firecol act as an intrusion prevention system which prevent the network attack using IPS rules. This form a virtual mitigation shield around the network by clusters of IPS system. The above mentioned attack can be detected using honeypot, an IDS(intrusion detection system). So we propose an approach called “IHoneycol” which effectively mitigates distributed denial of service in an efficient manner.","","978-1-4673-5786-9","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508281","DDoS;Honey pot;IPS rule;Ping of death;clone attack","Cloning;Collaboration;Computer crime;Filtering;IP networks;Servers","authorisation;filtering theory;firewalls;pattern clustering","DDoS attack mitigation;Firecol;IDS;IHoneycol;IPS rules;IPS system clusters;authorized services;blackhole;denial of service;distributed collaborative approach;distributed environment;filtering technique;firewall hardware;firewall software;honeypot;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;malicious node;malicious traffic filtering;network attack;security threat;sinkhole;virtual mitigation shield","","0","","10","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attacker usually upgrades itself to root privilege in vicious way using declared or covert holes on the compromised system. In this paper, we proposed a method to detect and resist vicious privilege upgrade based on integrity checking of trusted computing. At first, we calculated the secure hash values of the special executable code which upgrade privilege in legal way at relative safe status, and stored them in trusted platform model (TPM). Secondly, we embedded the anti-attack module in the scheduler of OS and kept pace with the scheduler. Once having detected privilege upgrade, we checked the integrity of current executable code with the pre-calculated secure hash values stored in TPM. Comparison mismatch explicated that object system was under attack. Object system terminated the current executable code immediately to resist vicious privilege upgrade. We realized this method based on Linux system and suggested an enhanced Linux kernel (ELK). Experiment result showed that this method can tolerate the existence of holes to a certain degree and safeguard system security from vicious privilege upgrade with acceptable cost.","","978-1-4244-5272-9","","10.1109/CNMT.2009.5374771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374771","","Computer bugs;Computer science;Kernel;Law;Legal factors;Linux;Operating systems;Processor scheduling;Resists;Security","Linux;security of data","OS scheduler;antiattack module;enhanced Linux kernel;integrity checking;object system;operating system;system security;trusted computing;trusted platform model;vicious privilege upgrade detection method","","0","","10","","","18-20 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main security concern for e-business is Web application security. Web applications have many vulnerabilities such as Injection, Broken Authentication and Session Management, and Cross-site scripting (XSS). Subsequently, web applications have become targets of hackers, and a lot of cyber attack began to emerge in order to block the services of these Web applications (Denial of Service Attach). Developers are not aware of these vulnerabilities and have no enough time to secure their applications. Therefore, there is a significant need to study and improve attack detection for web applications through determining the most significant factors for detection. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any research that summarizes the influent factors of detection web attacks. In this paper, the author studies state-of-the-art techniques and research related to web attack detection: the author analyses and compares different methods of web attack detections and summarizes the most important factors for Web attack detection independent of the type of vulnerabilities.

We extend this limitation of OpenFlow and propose User-Defined Actions (UDAs) for SDN. We discuss usecases of UDAs and propose an architecture to realize UDAs. Using our architecture we conduct a series of tests. We indicate that our UDAs can elevate millisecond-scale running time of current proposals to nanosecond-scale (including proposals from northbound applications of SDN community and virtual appliances of Network Function Virtualization or NFV community). Also, regarding ease of programmability, we show that our proposal decrease the lines of code of by 72.9% and 79.3% compared to implementing the same functionality as a northbound application and as a standalone middlebox, respectively.

It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study. Our successful experience confirms that the platform can greatly facilitate the development of security solutions on MANET.","","0-7695-2369-2","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607590","","Atomic layer deposition;Automatic testing;Emulation;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;System testing;Wireless networks","","","","2","","16","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an alternative hybrid-NIDS that couples an FPGA with a network adapter to provide hardware support for pattern matching and software support for post processing. The proposed system, SFAOENIDS, offers an extensible open-source NIDS for Solarflare AOE devices. The pattern matching engine-the primary component of the hardware architecture was designed based on the requirements of typical NIDS implementations.

There are two ways to model the system call sequences, one as full sequences and the other as lookahead pairs. Recently it has been shown that lookahead pairs perform better than full sequences. In this paper we propose an impurity tolerant model of anomaly detection using system calls called as Pairgram. Pairgram exploits the frequency information of lookahed pairs and build a model of normal behavior. As it is generally assumed that there is a skewed distribution of normal and abnormal sequences, more frequently occurring system call sequences are considered as normal and other way for less frequent sequences. A series of experiments on the University of New Mexico system call dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of Pairgram on impure dataset. Further the model is highly space efficient i.e., it has a constant space complexity of square of alphabet size of the program sequence.","","978-1-4673-0296-8","978-1-4673-0297-5","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151337","Impurity tolerant models;Intrusion detection system;Lookahead pairs;Program based anomaly detection","Approximation algorithms;Complexity theory;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","application program interfaces;computational complexity;security of data;software fault tolerance","Pairgram;abnormal sequence skewed distribution;constant space complexity;impurity tolerant model;lookahead pair frequency information modeling;normal sequence skewed distribution;program sequence;system call dataset;system call sequence based anomaly detection","","0","","42","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to explore the next step in rootkit evolution and to build strong defenses, we look at this issue from the point of view of an attacker. We construct Cloaker, a proof-of-concept rootkit for the ARM platform that is non- persistent and only relies on hardware state modifications for concealment and operation. A primary goal in the design of Cloaker is to not alter any part of the host operating system (OS) code or data, thereby achieving immunity to all existing rootkit detection techniques which perform integrity, behavior and signature checks of the host OS. Cloaker also demonstrates that a self-contained execution environment for malicious code can be provided without relying on the host OS for any services. Integrity checks of hardware state in each of the machine's devices are required in order to detect rootkits such as Cloaker. We present a framework for the Linux kernel that incorporates integrity checks of hardware state performed by device drivers in order to counter the threat posed by rootkits such as Cloaker.","1081-6011","978-0-7695-3168-7","","10.1109/SP.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531160","ARM;operating system;rootkit;security","Computer science;Computer security;Counting circuits;Hardware;Immune system;Kernel;Mobile handsets;Operating systems;Privacy;Virtual machining","Linux;security of data","Cloaker;Linux kernel;device drivers;hardware state modifications;hardware supported rootkit concealment;malicious attackers;rootkit detection techniques;system defenders","","5","","57","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IAC has two components, an operational computer emergency response team that monitors a major Department of Defense research network on a 27 × 7 basis, and a research component. Unlike many similar activities, the ARL computer emergency response team employs multiple network intrusion detection system tools to accomplish its mission, and serves as a testbed for IDS tools transitioning from universities and industry into the government and commercial sectors. The IAC's in-house research component is focused on architecture improvements to promote data fusion across sensors and time. Issues which the new architecture address include timeliness, archiving issues, and the incorporation of both signature and anomaly IDS tools into the architecture and the fusion of the information resulting from these different approaches. The IAC has a number of collaborations with industry and academia to promote IDS tools/methodologies focused on network surveillance, intrusion detection systems focused on advanced networking (OC12 and above), and the ""insider threat"".","1095-2055","0-7803-7553-X","","10.1109/ICCCN.2002.1206523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206523","","Communication standards;Computer crime;Computer displays;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Protection;Standards development;System testing","computer networks;emergency services;military communication;military computing;military standards;safety systems;security of data;sensor fusion;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards","ARL computer emergency response team;Army standard;Department of Defense research network;DoD standard;IAC;IDS tools;IDS tools/methodologies;Information Assurance Center;OC12;US Army Research Laboratory;advanced networking;archiving;commercial sector;communications infrastructure;component damage;computer emergency response team;computing infrastructure;data fusion;denial of service;government sector;illicit exploitation;industry;insider threat;intrusion detection systems;network intrusion detection system tools;network surveillance;sensors;testbed;timeliness;unauthorized access protection;universities","","1","","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a compiler-based solution to the notorious buffer overflow attack problem. Using this solution, users can prevent attackers from compromising their systems by changing the return address to execute injected code, which is the most common method used in buffer overflow attacks. Return address defender (RAD) is a simple compiler patch that automatically creates a safe area to store a copy of return addresses and automatically adds protection code into applications that it compiles to defend programs against buffer overflow attacks. Using it to protect a program does not need to modify the source code of the protected programs. Moreover, RAD does not change the layout of stack frames, so binary code it generated is compatible with existing libraries and other object files. Empirical performance measurements on a fully operational RAD prototype show that programs protected by RAD only experience a factor of between 1.01 to 1.31 slow-down. In this paper we present the principle of buffer overflow attacks, a taxonomy of defense methods, the implementation details of RAD, and the performance analysis of the RAD prototype","","0-7695-1077-9","","10.1109/ICDSC.2001.918971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918971","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Computer networks;Computer security;Libraries;Measurement;Program processors;Protection;Prototypes;Taxonomy","program compilers;security of data","RAD;arbitrary programs;binary code;buffer overflow attacks;compile-time solution;compiler patch;network-attached computer system;return address defender;security;stack frames","","37","6","26","","","Apr 2001","16 Apr 2001-19 Apr 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SPRT has been proven to be an optimal detection test when the probability distributions of both normal and abnormal behaviors are given. Furthermore, we introduce non-parametric methods, which require no training and are more adaptive to mobile scenarios. The proposed detection schemes are implemented and evaluated using a 48-node testbed and a mobile ad-hoc network emulator at the Army Research Lab.

Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources. In this paper, we provide evidence through simulation experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET intrusion detection system (IDS). We also discuss on how the similar friendship concept could be used to address several challenges faced in MANET environment.","","978-0-7695-3324-7","","10.1109/IAS.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627093","Friend Mechanisms;MANET;Small World","Ad hoc networks;Centralized control;Communication system control;Data communication;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Quality of service;Waste materials","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;quality of service;telecommunication network routing","MANET;QoS;autoconfiguration methods;autonomous environment;battery power;data transmission process;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;resource degradation;resource management","","4","","15","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a novel FPGA-based pattern matching architecture using a recent hashing algorithm called Cuckoo Hashing. The proposed architecture features on-the-fly pattern updates without reconfiguration, more efficient hardware utilization, and higher performance. Through various algorithmic changes of Cuckoo Hashing, we can implement parallel pattern matching on SRAM-based FPGA. Our system can accommodate the latest Snort rule-set, an open source network intrusion detection/prevention system, and achieve the highest utilization in terms of SRAM per character and logic cells per character at 17 bits/character and 0.043 logic cells/character, respectively on major Xilinx Virtex architectures.

Much work has been done in this field; however, they result in low memory efficiency. Due to the available on-chip memory and the number of I/O pins of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose a novel Memory efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM), based on pipelined binary search tree. With memory efficiency close to 1 byte/char, MASM can support a dictionary of over 4 MBytes, using a single FPGA device. The architecture can also be easily partitioned, so as to use external SRAM to handle even larger dictionaries of over 8 MBytes. Our implementation results show a sustained throughput of 3.5 Gbps, even when external SRAM is used. The MASM module can be simply duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves only rewriting the memory content, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","","978-0-7695-4056-6","978-1-4244-7143-0","10.1109/FCCM.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474050","FPGA;NIDS;NIPS;deep packet inspection;string matching","Databases;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Pins;Random access memory;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","SRAM chips;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;tree searching","FPGA;MASM;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large-scale string matching;malicious patterns;memory efficient architecture;memory-efficient approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;on-chip memory;pipelined binary search tree","","2","","17","","","2-4 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Switching across processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints. We develop index-type algorithms for the case with both known observation distributions and the case when the observation distributions have unknown parameters. We show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing the total expected cost as the error constraints approach zero.

Although numerous intrusion detection systems are available, yet it is not practical to install IDS in every virtual machine. In this paper, we argue that a virtual machine monitor (VMM) can support certain security functions that our proposed design can actively collect information directly from the VMM without installing an agent in the guest OS. In addition, bot could not aware of the existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and active detection approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the active detection agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates. Also, the result shows the active detection agent can detect a bot even when before it performs its malicious jobs. The proposed mechanism suites an enterprise having cloud environment well to defeat malware.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682703","bot;fingerprinting;hypervisor;intrusion detection","Conferences;Detectors;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","IDS;VMM;active bot fingerprinting;active detection approaches;bot behavior profiles;cloud security;cooperative botnet detection;cooperative botnet profiling;enterprise;guest OS;malicious jobs;malware;passive detection approaches;virtual machine monitor;virtualized environment","","0","","22","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network security algorithms DES and 3DES are integrated with the application to encrypt the sensitive information flow. These wireless security features are considered as an added factor to the NCS. Standard statistical approach (2<sup>k</sup> factorial experiment design) is used to study and estimate the effect of each factor on the system performance especially security additions.

This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario.

The scale of damage that could be done on these infrastructures by well-planned cyber-attacks is enormous. Most of the research work done for the security of these critical infrastructures focuses on conventional security measures. In this paper, we designed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that is based on the novel approach of Honey Token based Encrypted Pointers to prevent critical infrastructure networks from cyber-attacks particularly from zero day cyber threats. These honey tokens inside the frame will serve as a trap for the attacker. All nodes operating within the working domain of critical infrastructure network are divided into four different pools. This division is based according to their computational power and level of vulnerability. These pools are provided with different levels of security measures within the network. IDS use different number of Honey Tokens (HT) per frame for every different pool. Moreover every pool uses different types of encryption schemes (AES-128,192,256) etc. We use critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes for our simulations. We analyzed the performance of IDS in terms of True Positive and False Negative Alarms. Finally we test this IDS through Network Penetration Testing (NPT). This NPT is accomplished by putting the critical infrastructure network of 64 nodes directly under the zero day cyber-attacks and then we analyze the behavior of the IDS under such realistic conditions. The IDS is designed in such a way that it not only detects the intrusions but also recovers the entire zero day attack using reverse engineering approach.","","","","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974088","Critical Infrastructure Networks;Cyber Security;Cyber Space;Cyber Threats;Cyber Warfare;DNP3;Distributed Sensor Networks;Encrypted Pointers;Honey Token;Industrial Communication Protocol;Industrial Networks;Information Infrastructure;Information Security;Intelligence Infrastructure;Intrusion Detection System;SCADA Command and Control System;Zero Day Attacks","Databases;Encryption;Generators;Intrusion detection;Protocols","computer network security;critical infrastructures;cryptography;reverse engineering","IDS;NPT;critical infrastructure networks;cyber-attacks;encryption schemes;false negative alarms;honey token based encrypted pointers;intrusion detection system;network penetration testing;reverse engineering approach;true positive alarms;zero day cyber threats","","0","1","20","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be formulated as a dependability problem as follows. Two processors jointly provide a real-time service which can be completed by exactly one processor. Assuming each processor is allowed to announce only one-bit information to decide which one to process the job, inevitably some of the jobs will get lost if only classical resources are used.

Thus the optimization power of Genetic Algorithm has been applied to select a small number of significant fuzzy rules for a compact classification system applied to multivariate dataset classification. The hybrid algorithm is used here to predict cellular localization sites of proteins in yeast. Two different fitness measures were taken to evaluate the rules generated by the algorithm during evolution process. Than the performance of Fuzzy Genetic algorithm with better fitness measure is compared to the performance of Naïve Bayesian approach to accurately detect and classify patterns. The performance analysis includes testing on train as well as test dataset, created from original dataset.

The paper analyses the requirements of ISP-operated intrusion prevention systems and presents our approach for an IPS that runs on top of an active networking environment and is automatically configured by a vulnerability scanner. We call the system FIDRAN (Flexible Intrusion Detection and Response framework for Active Networks). The system autonomously analyses the home network and correspondingly configures the IPS. Furthermore, our system detects and adjusts itself to changes in the home network (new service, new host, etc.).

Host-based intrusion detection offers the ability to detect misuse and subversion through the direct monitoring of processes inside the host, providing an important complement to network-based surveillance. Suites of eXpert-BSMs may be deployed throughout a network, and their alarms managed, correlated, and acted on by remote or local subscribing security services, thus helping to address issues of decentralized management. Inside the host, eXpert-BSM is intended to operate as a true security daemon for host systems, consuming few CPU cycles and very little memory and secondary storage. eXpert-BSM has been available for download on the Internet since April 2000, and has been successfully deployed in several production environments.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991540","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991540","","Data security;Electronic switching systems;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Remote monitoring;Secure storage;Sun;Surveillance;Trademarks","computer network management;expert systems;network operating systems;security of data;system monitoring","Internet;Sun Solaris;audit trails;decentralized management;eXpert-BSM;host-based intrusion detection;knowledge base;misuse;real time forward-reasoning expert system;security daemon;security services;system operator","","6","35","23","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on ""traditional"" graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781","","Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic","","1","","21","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The human labeling of the available network audit data instances is usually tedious, time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called k-means clustering via naïve bayes classification for anomaly based network intrusion detection.

Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2008.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182","Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity","","Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data","Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability","","12","","27","","2008-02-02","Jan.-March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711","978-1-4577-2027-7","978-1-4577-2026-0","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","1","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Payload-based approaches are effective to known DOS attacks but are unable to be deployed on high-speed networks. To address this issue, flow-based DOS detection schemes have been proposed for highspeed networks as an effective supplement of payload-based solutions. However, existing flow-based solutions have serious limitations in detecting unknown attacks and efficiently identifying real attack flows buried in the background traffic. In addition, existing solutions also have difficulty to adapt to attack dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a flow-based DOS detection scheme based on Artificial Immune systems. We adopt a tree structure to store flow information such that we can effectively extract useful features from flow information for better detecting DoS attacks. We employ Neighborhood Negative Selection (NNS) as the detection algorithm to detect unknown DoS attacks, and identify attack flows from massive traffic. Because the strong tolerance of NNS, the proposed solution is able to quickly adapt attack dynamics. The experimental results show that this solution is able to effectively detect unknown DoS attack flows and identify attack flows from background traffic. Meanwhile, the theoretical analysis demonstrates that this system can extract flow features more effectively.","","978-1-4673-1855-6","","10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664254","Artificial immune;DoS attack;Flow;Intrusion detection","Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Data mining;Detectors;Feature extraction;IP networks;Protocols","Internet;artificial immune systems;computer network security;real-time systems;telecommunication traffic","DoS attack flows;DoS attacks;Internet;NNS;artificial immune systems;attack dynamics;background traffic;detection algorithm;flow information;flow-based DOS detection schemes;flow-based solutions;high-speed networks;neighborhood negative selection;payload-based approaches;payload-based solutions;real attack flows;tree structure","","0","","14","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most tested and reliable technologies to monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic to identify unauthorized usage and mishandling of computer system networks. It is critical to implement network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) in computer networks that have high traffic and high-speed connectivity. Due to the fact that software NIDSs are still unable to detect all the growing threats to high-speed environments, such as flood attacks (UDP, TCP, ICMP and HTTP) or Denial and Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DoS/DDoS), because the main function of these kinds of attacks is simply to send more traffic in high speed to systems to stop or slow down the performance of systems. Here we have designed a suitable real network to present experiments that use Snort NIDSs to demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDSs, such as its inability to process multiple packets at high speeds and its propensity to drop packets without analysing them. This paper outlines Snort NIDSs' failures in high-speed and heavy traffic and its propensity to drop more packets as the speed and volume of traffic increase. We ran some consecutive tests to analyse the Snort performance using the number of packets received, the number of packets analysed, the number of packets filtered and the number of packets dropped. We suggest a parallel NIDS technology to reduce dropping packets as a solution.","","","","10.1109/ICEBE.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686259","IDS;network security;open source","Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DoS/DDoS;HTTP;ICMP;Snort NIDSs;Snort performance analysis;TCP;UDP;computer networks;distributed denial of service attacks;flood attacks;high-speed traffic;incoming network traffic monitoring;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection systems;outgoing network traffic monitoring;security tools;unauthorized usage identification;wireless systems","","0","","23","","","11-13 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 18th IEEE International Symposium on","20071212","2007","","","159","168","Computer and network security incidents have increasing financial consequences as demand for network accessibility and connectivity to resources continues to rise. These security incidents can lead to direct financial losses either through data theft of personal and/or proprietary information as well as a reputational damage which may negatively impact stock prices or consumer confidence in a company. This paper examines a large set of security incident data using tools from the software reliability community. We look at applying Non-Homogenous Poisson Process (NHPP) models as a method for describing the reliability growth process. We examine the full set of incidents as well as subsets of the data based on incident types. We look at using the Laplace test to guide selection of the appropriate models. Then, based on the trend results, we apply various NHPP models (i.e., Goel-Okumutu, S-Shaped, Duane, and K-Stage Curve) to illustrate the relevance of using these models to fit the incident data and to predict future incidents.","1071-9458","978-0-7695-3024-6","","10.1109/ISSRE.2007.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4402207","","Computer network reliability;Computer security;Context modeling;Data security;Helium;Information security;Predictive models;Reliability engineering;Software reliability;Testing","security of data;software reliability","computer security incidents;consumer confidence;data theft;network security incidents;nonhomogenous Poisson process;reliability growth process;reputational damage;software reliability;stock prices","","3","","15","","","5-9 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool to protect computer networks from attacks. Traditional packet-based NIDSs are time-intensive as they analyze all network packets. A state-of-the-art NIDS should be able to handle a high volume of traffic in real time. Flow-based intrusion detection is an effective method for high speed networks since it inspects only packet headers. The existence of new attacks in the future is another challenge for intrusion detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection is a well-known method capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose a flow-based anomaly detection system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important approach for anomaly detection. We used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with one hidden layer. We investigate the use of a Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) in optimizing interconnection weights of a MLP network. Our proposed GSA-based flow anomaly detection system (GFADS) is trained with a flow-based data set. The trained system can classify benign and malicious flows with 99.43% accuracy. We compare the performance of GSA with traditional gradient descent training algorithms and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results show that GFADS is effective in flow-based anomaly detection. Finally, we propose a four-feature subset as the optimal set of features.","","978-1-4799-3247-4","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2013.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679866","Flow-based anomaly detection;Gravitational Search algorithm;Multi-layer Perceptron","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","multilayer perceptrons;search problems;security of data","ANN;GFADS;GSA algorithm;GSA-based flow anomaly detection system;MLP network;anomaly-based intrusion detection;artificial neural network;benign flow classification;flow-based anomaly detection;flow-based intrusion detection;gravitational search algorithm;high speed networks;malicious flow classification;multilayer perceptron neural network","","1","","20","","","8-11 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are credible targets of active (e.g., terrorist) attacks since their disruption may lead to sizable losses economically and in human lives. It is thus crucial to develop decision support that can guide administrators in deploying defense resources for system security and reliability. Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights. We also contrast our results with those of static games, and quantify the gain in defender payoff due to misinformation of the attacker.","0885-8950","","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2226480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378414","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Cost function;Game theory;Games;Load modeling;Markov processes;Power transmission lines;Security","Markov processes;game theory;power grids;power system security;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability","Colombia;IEEE standard 14-bus system;Markov game analysis;Stackelberg games;WECC 9-bus system;Yemen;decision support;defense mechanism;defense resources;dynamic states;electricity grids;equilibrium mixed strategies;game model;infrastructure protection;power network attack-defense;static games;system reliability;system security;transmission network continual attack-defense;zero-sum Markov games","","5","","28","","2012-12-11","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the large number of false alarms is a big problem for these detection systems which greatly reduces their effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate this problem, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to help filter out false alarms by adaptively and periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor) that conduct the best single-algorithm performance. Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level. In this paper, we aim to conduct a case study in exploring the performance of our developed false alarm filter by implementing a fuzzy classifier based on if-then rules. By comparing with other algorithms that have been implemented in our false alarm filter, the experimental results show that the if-then rules based fuzzy algorithm performs a bit better than the baseline algorithm and can be improved by selecting an appropriate fuzzy partition.","","978-1-4673-0025-4","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233768","False alarm reduction;Intelligent fuzzy system;Machine learning;Network intrusion detection","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","baseline algorithm;fuzzy algorithm;fuzzy classifier;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy partition;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network security infrastructure;single algorithm performance;stable level","","1","","25","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these cloud features also raise many security concerns related to cloud computing resources. In this paper, we propose an architecture and approach for leveraging the virtualization technology at the core of cloud computing to perform intrusion detection security using hypervisor performance metrics. Through the use of virtual machine performance metrics gathered from hypervisors, such as packets transmitted/received, block device read/write requests, and CPU utilization, we demonstrate and verify that suspicious activities can be profiled without detailed knowledge of the operating system running within the virtual machines. The proposed hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system does not require additional software installed in virtual machines and has many advantages compared to host-based and network based intrusion detection systems which can complement these traditional approaches to intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785472","Cloud Computing;hypervisor;intrusion detection","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer network security;software architecture;software metrics;virtual machines;virtualisation","CPU utilization;block device read requests;block device write requests;cloud computing resources;cloud features;hypervisor performance metrics;hypervisor-based cloud intrusion detection system;intrusion detection security;multitenancy;operating system;packet transmission;received packets;shared resource utilization;virtual machine performance metrics;virtualization;virtualization technology","","1","","16","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
