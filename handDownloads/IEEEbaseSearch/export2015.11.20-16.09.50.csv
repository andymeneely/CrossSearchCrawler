However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","12","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm is a multiple patterns matching algorithm commonly used for such applications. In order to meet the highly demanding performance requirements imposed on these applications, achieving high performance for AC algorithm is crucial. In this paper, we present a high performance parallel implementation of AC algorithm on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) which efficiently utilizes the high degree of on-chip parallelism and the memory hierarchy of the GPU so that the aggregate performance (or throughput) of the GPU can be maximized. For this purpose our approach carefully places and caches the input text data and the reference pattern data used for pattern matching in the on-chip shared memories and the texture caches of the GPU. Furthermore, it efficiently schedules the off-chip global memory loads and the shared memory stores in order to minimize the overheads in loading the input data to the shared memories and also to minimize the shared memory bank conflicts. The proposed approach leads to a significant cut-down of the effective memory access latencies and leads to impressive performance improvements. Experimental results on Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 GPU show that our approach delivers up to 127Gbps throughput performance and up to 222-times speedup compared with a serial version running on 2.2Ghz Core2Duo Intel processor.","","978-0-7695-4979-8","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651081","Aho-Corasick algorithm;GPU;parallelization;shared-memory bank conflict","AC machines;Algorithm design and analysis;Doped fiber amplifiers;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Memory management;Pattern matching","graphics processing units;parallel processing;pattern matching","AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick algorithm;Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 GPU;graphic processing unit;high throughput parallel implementation;memory access latencies;memory hierarchy;off-chip global memory loads;on-chip parallelism;patterns matching algorithm","","1","","19","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.","1060-9857","978-0-7695-3826-6","","10.1109/SRDS.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421","exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware","Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server","Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security","HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit","","1","1","36","","","27-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most prevalent among them are spoof threats, in which one network device changes its network identifiers to that of another network device. One of the possible reasons of spoofing in wireless network is that per-frame source authentication is not provided. Full scale authentication can be provided, but it is not always desirable as it requires reliable key management. The attacker can further launch Denial of Service attacks by spoofing deauthentication/disassociation or power saving frames, can bypass the access control list or can falsely advertise services to wireless clients. This paper discusses some of the non cryptographic techniques to detect MAC spoofing along with their pros and cons and the network scenarios in which they can be used.

Based on the fact that some of the statistical properties are related to a certain kind of traffic, which is also reflected in the allocation of the dynamic co-occurrence matrix, we are able to display the global status of our network and show periods, where the traffic behaviour is unusual.

When used with attack graph-based security metrics, the attack graph may be used to quantitatively assess security-relevant aspects of a network. The Shortest Path metric, the Number of Paths metric, and the Mean of Path Lengths metric are three attack graph-based security metrics that can extract security-relevant information. However, one's usage of these metrics can lead to misleading results. The Shortest Path metric and the Mean of Path Lengths metric fail to adequately account for the number of ways an attacker may violate a security policy. The Number of Paths metric fails to adequately account for the attack effort associated with the attack paths. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a complimentary suite of attack graph-based security metrics and specify an algorithm for combining the usage of these metrics.

Using this model, we show that it is possible to perform very efficient sampling with limited impact on traffic feature distributions, thus minimizing the decrease of anomaly detection efficiency. Specifically, we propose an adaptive, feature-aware statistical sampling technique and compare it both formally and empirically with other known sampling techniques - random flow sampling and selective sampling.

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","1","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2198666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198335","Industrial networks;information security;network security;risk assessment;security analysis and monitoring;security countermeasures","Availability;Guidelines;NIST;Process control;Risk management;Security;Servers","computer network security;production engineering computing;risk management","Information and Communication Technology;cyber threat;detect-and-patch philosophy;distributed ICT infrastructure;general-purpose computer network protection;industrial computer network;industrial distributed computing system;security countermeasure;security issues;security risk","","17","","105","","2012-05-10","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings. Ninth International Conference on","20020806","2000","","","114","119","This paper proposes a new approach to fault detection for a link state routing system-property oriented analysis and detection (POD). A routing system is modeled as a set of distributed processes. A property is defined as state predicate(s) over system variables. For the link state routing protocol, the high-level overall converging property P is defined as the “synchronization” among routing information bases maintained by all processes. We decompose the routing protocol into different computation phases. For each phase, we use invariant state predicates (safety property) and the liveness property as our guide for observation and analysis. The goal of the detection algorithm is to construct a validation path based on the history to determine if the fault is natural or malicious once the stable property P is rendered invalid by faults. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, a new detection approach is proposed that differs from traditional signature-based or profile-based intrusion detection paradigms in the sense that it utilizes the stable property as a starting point, and correlates the history and future to validate changes in the system; second, by exploring the primary concerned system properties, we show that detection effort can be conducted in a more focused and systematic fashion","1095-2055","0-7803-6494-5","","10.1109/ICCCN.2000.885479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885479","","ARPANET;Computer science;Costs;Detection algorithms;Fault detection;History;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Safety;Topology","authorisation;computer network management;computer network reliability;protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication network routing","distributed processes;fault detection;intrusion detection;invariant state predicates;link state routing protocol;liveness property;malicious fault;natural fault;property oriented analysis;safety property;synchronization;system variables;validation path","","1","","17","","","2000","16 Oct 2000-18 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

In this paper, a hierarchical classifier combiner is proposed to detect network intrusions based on the fusion of multiple well-known and efficient classifiers. The KDDCUP99 dataset is used to train and test the classifiers. The overall performance in terms of the overall error rate, average cost and the false alarm rate is investigated and discussed.

Rolling back and re-executing damaged transactions increase the response time of the system and may cause a significant processing delay. In such situations, the availability of the system is compromised and the system suffers the vulnerability of denial of service (DoS). In this paper, we propose a defensive executing technique and analyze its effectiveness.

"On using multiple classifier systems for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) anomaly detection","Mehta, A.; Hantehzadeh, N.; Gurbani, V.K.; Tin Kam Ho; Sander, F.","","Communications (ICC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on","20121129","2012","","","1101","1106","The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an important multimedia session establishment protocol used on the Internet. It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364010","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms;Vectors","Internet;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;unsupervised learning","Euclidean distance classifier;Internet;SIP message;anomaly detection;feature reduction measurement;machine learning algorithm;message malforming;multimedia session establishment protocol;multiple classifier system;self-learning system;session initiation protocol;text-based protocol","","0","","27","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, existing approaches fail to provide the verifiability of the append-only property of the file system in the presence of an inside attacker who can manipulate on-disk data directly, and thus are unsuitable for use in regulatory compliance. This paper presents the design and implementation of VAOFS, a Verifiable Append-Only File System for regulatory compliance. Verifiability is provided by a tamper resistant hardware device cooperating with an instrumented file system. Non-appending operations can be detected in an audit process. A time-based secure deletion method is also proposed to handle file deletion in VAOFS. Experiments with a prototype VAOFS called ext3ao built with ext3 show that the overhead of ext3ao is 53.0% compared with ext3; the audit process is efficient.","","978-0-7695-3766-5","","10.1109/GCC.2009.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5279563","append-only file system;regulatory compliance;secure deletion","Data engineering;Data security;File systems;Grid computing;Hardware;Image storage;Instruments;Postal services;Prototypes;Telecommunication computing","file organisation;security of data;write-once storage","audit process;ext3ao;file deletion;immutable data;inside attacker;instrumented file system;nonappending operations;on-disk data;prototype VAOFS;regulatory compliance requirements;tamper resistant hardware device;time-based secure deletion method;verifiable append-only file system;write-once-read-many devices","","0","1","22","","","27-29 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By modeling the transition probabilities between the SMP states and the sojourn time of each SMP state, the mean times to compromise (MTTCs) of the normal and penetration attacks are calculated. With increased probabilities of breaker trips resulted from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities (LOLP) are evaluated based on IEEE reliability test system 79 (RTS79).

In this paper, we derive a statistical model for the estimation of dendrograms, taking into account the uncertainty (through noise or corruption) in the distances among data points. We focus on just the estimation of the hierarchy of partitions afforded by the dendrogram, rather than the heights in the latter. The concept of estimating this ""dendrogram structure"" under SLHC is introduced, and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dendrogram structure is described. The proposed concept is demonstrated by a simple Monte Carlo simulation which demonstrates that the proposed MLE method performs better than SLHC in obtaining the correct structure.","","978-1-4799-8728-3","","10.1109/CYBER.2015.7288035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288035","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Couplings;Maximum likelihood estimation;Measurement;Monte Carlo methods","Monte Carlo methods;maximum likelihood estimation;pattern clustering;statistical analysis","MLE method;Monte Carlo simulation;SLHC;approximate maximum likelihood estimator;data points;data uncertainties;dendrogram structure estimation;distance uncertainty;partition hierarchy estimation;single-linkage hierarchical clustering;statistical estimation","","","","","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe the system architecture and discuss the different cases of attack scenarios involving the mobility of the attacking and victim nodes. Our proposed solution takes into account practical issues such as limited resources of the mobile nodes. It has distinct advantages such as monitoring of the traffic to the victim node and the attack traffic being dropped before reaching the victim, the ability to trace back the attacking node and prevent the attack at the home agent or foreign agent that is closer to the attacking node, and the ability to deal with dynamic changes in attack traffic patterns.

In an NIDS, the most important and time-consuming processes are pattern matching and deep inspection of the header and the body of packets. Several analyses show that this process can take up to 75% of the time of processing packets. In this paper, relying on the processing power of general purpose graphics cards - which seem to be a better option compared to other hardware technologies like FPGAs with regard to speed, scalability, flexibility, ease of programming and price - and with the idea of having the signature-based detection engine of NIDS systems run on GPU rather than CPU, it is tried to present an efficient method to increase the speed of intrusion detection systems such as Snort.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","27","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Following a case study approach, we then select four prevalent attacks that are suggested by our methodology, and use our findings to identify the underlying vulnerability, and document statistics showing that these vulnerabilities are responsible for the creation of phishing Websites.

Some data capture critical system events, the arrival of these data will significantly influence the monitoring reaction speed, we call them urgent data. High speed urgent data collection would help system to act in real time when facing fatal error. On the other hand, slowing down the collection speed of others may render more bandwidth.

Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e.g., “Atak” worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms. We propose different integrated schemes for fighting different self-disciplinary worms, and evaluate their performance via real-world traffic data.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313807","Worm;anomaly detection.;game theory","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Distributed computing;Forensics;Game theory;Traffic control;Web and internet services","Internet;game theory;invasive software","Internet;detection probability;game theoretic formulation;self-disciplinary worms;worm detection schemes;worm propagation","","4","","61","","2009-11-06","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition, the transmission accuracy of wireless communications suffers from radio irregularities caused by obstacles such as human bodies in the environment. The human body selectively reflects, diffracts and scatters the radio signal which affects the received signal strength. This paper presents an approach to detecting human activity using fluctuations in the received signal strength. These fluctuations are detected using an overcomplete dictionary based pattern recognition algorithm. Performance results are presented which show that the proposed system has an accuracy of 86% in detecting human activity.

To overcome this matter, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used as a vital instrument in defending the network from this malicious activity. With the ability to analyze network traffic and recognize incoming and on-going network attack, majority of network administrator has turn to IDS to help them in detecting anomalies in network traffic. The gathering of information and analysis on the anomalies activity can be classified into fast and slow attack. Since fast attack activity make a connection in few second and uses a large amount of packet, detecting this early connection provide the administrator one step ahead in deflecting further damages towards the network infrastructure. This paper describes IDS that detects fast attack intrusion using time based detection method. The time based detection method calculates the statistic of the frequency event which occurs between one second time intervals for each connection made to a host thus providing the crucial information in detecting fast attack.","","978-1-4244-8048-7","978-0-7695-4177-8","10.1109/NETAPPS.2010.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635816","","Conferences;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Logistics;Predictive models;Protocols","Internet;computer network security;security of data","Internet;fast attack activity;frequency event statistics;malicious activity;network intrusion detection system;time based intrusion detection","","0","","26","","","22-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The state-of-the-art approach for network monitoring and analysis involves storage and analysis of network flow statistic. However, this approach loses much valuable information within the Internet traffic. With the advancement of commodity hardware, in particular the volume of storage devices and the speed of interconnect technologies used in network adapter cards and multi-core processors, it is now possible to capture 10 Gbps and beyond real-time network traffic using a commodity computer, such as n2disk. Also with the advancement of distributed file system (such as Hadoop, ZFS, etc.) and open cloud computing platform (such as OpenStack, CloudStack, and Eucalyptus, etc.), it is practical to store such large volume of traffic data and fully in-depth analyse the inside communication within an acceptable latency. In this paper, based on wellknown TimeMachine, we present TIFAflow, the design and implementation of a novel system for archiving and querying network flows. Firstly, we enhance the traffic archiving system named TImemachine+FAstbit (TIFA) with flow granularity, i.e., supply the system with flow table and flow module. Secondly, based on real network traces, we conduct performance comparison experiments of TIFAflow with other implementations such as common database solution, TimeMachine and TIFA system. Finally, based on comparison results, we demonstrate that TIFAflow has a higher performance improvement in storing and querying performance than TimeMachine and TIFA, both in time and space metrics.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574679","NoSQL;bitmap database;cloud computing;forensic analysis;hadoop distributed file system;network security;phishing attack;traffic archival","Cloud computing;Forensics;Internet;Network security;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","","","","2","","","","","August 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

However, they have the shortcoming that there are undetectable intrusions according to types for each measure and modeling method because each intrusion type results in anomalies. We propose a multiple-measure intrusion detection method to remedy this drawback of conventional anomaly detectors. We measure normal behavior by system calls, resource usage and file access events and build up profiles for normal behavior with a hidden Markov model, statistical method and rule-base method, which are integrated with a rule-based approach.

Virtualization technology brings a new chance to protect operating systems out-of-box in hypervisors. This article proposes a system monitoring and controlling framework, named as BMCS, which monitors low-level states and hardware accessing events of operating system in a hypervisor. BMCS abstracts low-level states and events and profiles OS-level semantics with the help of a hosted daemon. Moreover, it can control the execution of operating system software through the hypervisor. Our out-of box method can collect real run-time operating system profile and control the execution of the OS according some defined rules. As a result, it makes the operating system stronger.

Most of an organization's sensitive and proprietary data resides in a Database Management System (DBMS). Data security is a major issue in any web-based application and database repository. Although there are various model implemented in the network for the security of these databases. Real world web databases have information that needs to be securely stored and accessed. In this paper we discussed proposed work classification based approach to create database policy dynamically and using these policy find intrusion in user request and response the request accordingly. The focus of our work is to develop advanced security solutions for protecting the data residing in a DBMS. Our approach is to develop an Intrusion Detection and Response (IDR) system. We introduce a policy-driven intrusion response mechanism that is capable of issuing an appropriate response based on the details of the anomalous request and discuss the implementation details on the same and report experimental results that show that our techniques are feasible and efficient.","","978-1-4799-3063-0","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056934","Alarms;Anomalies;IDRS;IDS;classification;countermeasure;security policies","Databases;Security","data protection;database management systems;pattern classification;security of data","DBMS;IDR system;advanced security solutions;classification;data protection;database policy;intrusion detection and response system;policy-driven intrusion response mechanism;respond anomaly requests","","0","","9","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although VPN technology is very useful, it imposes security threats on the remote network because its firewall does not know what traffic is flowing inside the VPN tunnel. To address this issue, we propose VGuard, a framework that allows a policy owner and a request owner to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy without the policy owner knowing the request and the request owner knowing the policy. We first present an efficient protocol, called Xhash, for oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, without disclosing their numbers to each other. Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of VGuard is to first convert a firewall policy to nonoverlapping numerical rules and then use Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. Comparing with the Cross-Domain Cooperative Firewall (CDCF) framework, which represents the state-of-the-art, VGuard is not only more secure but also orders of magnitude more efficient. On real-life firewall policies, for processing packets, our experimental results show that VGuard is three to four orders of magnitude faster than CDCF.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557862","Virtual private networks;network security.;privacy","Computers;Encryption;IP networks;Privacy;Protocols;Servers;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;protocols;virtual private networks","VGuard framework;VPN technology;Xhash protocol;cross-domain cooperative firewall;encryption tunnel;firewall policy;privacy preserving collaborative enforcement;virtual private networks","","5","","16","","2010-08-26","May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

F-Sign is primarily intended for high-speed network traffic filtering devices that are based on deep-packet inspection. Malicious executables are analyzed using two approaches: disassembly, utilizing IDA-Pro, and the application of a dedicated state machine in order to obtain the set of functions comprising the executables. The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures. Evaluation of F-Sign was conducted under various conditions. The findings suggest that the proposed method can be used for automatically generating signatures that are both specific and sensitive.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2068544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5585792","Automatic signature generation (ASG);malware;malware filtering","Binary codes;Grippers;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Real time systems;Software","digital signatures;error detection;finite state machines;invasive software","F-sign;IDA-Pro;automatic extraction;automatic signature generation;common function repository;deep packet inspection;entropy score;false positive detection error;function-based signature generation;high speed network traffic filtering device;intelligent candidate selection;malware;signature candidate list;signature extraction process;state machine","","1","","38","","2010-09-27","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Lots of works have been done trying to figure out the best solution for this problem, and some works presented the optimal solution for transmitting the stored video using smoothing schemes applied to each individual stream. But those smoothing schemes considered only one stream, not the whole streams being serviced, to apply themselves, which could only achieve local optimum not the global optimum. Most of all, they did not exploit statistical multiplexing gain that can be obtained before smoothing. In this paper, we propose a new smoothing scheme that deals with not an individual stream but the whole streams being serviced simultaneously to achieve the optimal network bandwidth utilization and maximize the number of streams that can be serviced simultaneously. We formally proved that the proposed scheme not only provides deterministic QoS for each client but also maximizes number of clients that can be serviced simultaneously and hence achieves maximum utilization of transmission bandwidth.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2003.6596820","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6596820","Variable bit rate;aggregated smoothing;multimedia systems;traffic smoothing","Admission control;Bandwidth;Multiplexing;Prefetching;Schedules;Smoothing methods","","","","1","","11","","","Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Being based on a set of rules, i.e., attack signatures, the accuracy and reliability of IDS detection heavily depend on the quality of the employed rule set. In this context, any conflicts that arise between rules create ambiguity in classification of network traffic or host events, not only affecting the performance of IDS, but also putting the system in a vulnerable position. Currently existing techniques for conflict detection focus primarily on the security policy of the network devices: IPSec, routers, firewalls. In this paper we address the conflict detection in host and network-based intrusion detection and response devices and present a rule management framework that allows rule set analysis for potential conflicts. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach on three collections of attack signatures: the set provided by the vendor of the commercial IDS and the rule sets of the open source Snort IDS and bleeding edge threats. Our analysis reveal conflicts in each of them.","","978-1-4244-5344-3","978-0-7695-3805-1","10.1109/CONGRESS.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341717","attack signitures;intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Computer security;Event detection;Hemorrhaging;Intrusion detection;Niobium;Payloads;Privacy;Telecommunication traffic","knowledge based systems;security of data","bleeding edge threat;conflict detection;open source Snort IDS;rule management framework;rule misconfiguration classification;rule misconfiguration discovery;signature-based intrusion detection","","2","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
