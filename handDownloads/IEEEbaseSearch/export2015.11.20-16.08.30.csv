We identify the general functional parameters that can be controlled, and by means of extensive experimentation, we tune these parameters and analyze the trade-offs between them, aiming at reducing false positives, overhead, and detection time.

Acad., Bucharest, Romania","Communications (COMM), 2014 10th International Conference on","20140726","2014","","","1","4","The only suitable option for risk assessment systems designed with real-time constraints in mind, in the present seems to be the one based on attack graphs. Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts. This intelligent system assesses the risk of a cyber-attack taking place and bringing the defense systems to an alarmed state in a timely manner, which can help offer a quick response against an attacker.","","","","10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866746","attack vector;cyber security;danger theory;early warning systems;neural networks;risk assessment","Alarm systems;Artificial intelligence;Immune system;Internet;Neural networks;Risk management","computational complexity;computer network security;feedforward;graph theory;neural nets;risk management","Matzinger danger theory;attack graph;attack surface;attack traces;biologically inspired risk assessment;computational complexity;cyber security;feedforward backward-propagating neural network;immune response;immune system;intelligent system;threat data","","2","","10","","","29-31 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeyd is an open-source honeypot; however, it uses a command-line interface and its configuration is difficult for beginners. The purpose of this study is to use the open-source tool to construct a graphic user interface (GUI) for honeyd. For the sake of portability and easy deployment, the whole system will be installed in a live USB stick. The end user can create a honeyd template by using the GUI or the result of the Nmap scan of a target computer. Moreover, the system will provide a log-review interface and real-time SMS functionality.

The drastic increase in network speed and detection workloads necessitates the need for highly efficient network intrusion detection systems(NIDS). Since most NIDSs need to check for a large number of known attack patterns in every packet, pattern matching becomes the most significant part of signature-based NIDSs in terms of processing and memory resources. To support segmentation of network traffic and to detect fragmented attacks, we propose a method which performs both 'partial' and 'full' pattern matching using the data structure CDAWG (Compact Direct Acyclic Word Graph). In the present work, we designed and implemented an efficient string matching algorithm using CDAWG structure. Experimental results show that this algorithm is 2.5 times faster than the currently used Aho-Corasick algorithm.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809011","Aho-Corasick;Boyer-Moore;Dawg structure;Snort;intrusion detection;pattern matching;rule database","Computer networks;Computer science;Data structures;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","data structures;digital signatures;security of data;string matching","CDAWG data structure;attack pattern;compact direct acyclic word graph;fragmented attack detection;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;pattern matching algorithm;signature-based NIDS;string matching algorithm","","0","","14","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","25","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented.

To reduce the number of data transactions, a data management scheme is presented in this paper. The required data to be transferred are defined and a suitable coding is proposed.

Against this backdrop, deep processing of network packets has become an important subject for researchers. Since malicious packets often disguise their sensitive information in one way or another in order to bypass the packet filter, this paper proposes a high-speed discrete content sensitive pattern match algorithm for imperceptible deep packet filtering. The filter sets up and manages (including lookup and update) a sensitive information database, monitors both packet header and payload at line speed with hardware-based discrete content sensitive pattern match, and then executes the corresponding action. The paper mainly discusses a TCAM (ternary content addressable memory)-based pattern match algorithm as well as the architecture and performance analysis of a packet filtering system based on this algorithm. We present a totally new idea of hardware-based discrete content sensitive pattern match. Based on the result of algorithm evaluation and performance analysis, such a packet filtering system can achieve optimal functionality and efficiency that makes network monitoring much easier to work.","","0-7695-2033-2","","10.1109/ICCNMC.2003.1243040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1243040","","Content management;Databases;Filtering algorithms;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads;Performance analysis","Internet;content-addressable storage;packet switching;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","TCAM;algorithm evaluation;deep packet filtering;hardware-based discrete content;network monitoring;network packets;network security;pattern matching;performance analysis;ternary content addressable memory","","4","","26","","","20-23 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology. Based on the observations, we make valuable conclusions about which attacks induce more false alarm and impact on Mobile Ad Hoc Network.","","978-1-4244-9004-2","","10.1109/INTERACT.2010.5706198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706198","Attacks;MANET;Wireless Networks","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Watches;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","MANET;base station;centralized access point;constant nodes;constrained capability;distributed cooperation;dynamic topology;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;network traffics;node legitimate information;open medium;packet delivery ratio;pervasive trust management model enhancement;routing protocol;throughput;varying pause time;wireless mobile hosts","","0","","29","","","3-5 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework. The experimental setup includes deep packet inspection, intrusion detection and network quarantining to secure a web server from network scanners.

Our schemes use different independent memory noise filling techniques called pre-deployment and post-deployment noise filling, and also different communication protocols for attestation purpose. The protocols are well-suited for wireless sensor networks, where external factors , such as channel collision, result in network delay.

Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not. The study was based on available network traffic datasets (KDD'99 dataset and WiSNet dataset).

The design and implementation of our WLAN-based AVI system was based on reducing the identification time in order to cover high-speed cars. As time is required to establish a network connection between a roadside access point and a car station, identifying a high-speed car by communicating through that network connection is not feasible. We utilize IEEE 802.11 management frame such as probe request frame in order to identify a station without establishing a network connection. We also control the timing of the scanning procedure in order to generate enough frames for reliable identification of high speed-cars.

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself.

Providing an online IDS to the storage controller is essential for dealing with compromised hosts or coordinated attacks by multiple hosts. SAN block storage controllers are connected to the world via block-level protocols, such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel. Usually, block-level storage systems do not maintain information specific to the file-system using them. The range of threats that can be handled at the block level is limited. A file system view at the controller, together with the knowledge of which arriving block belongs to which file or inode, will enable the detection of file-level threats. In this paper, we present IDStor, an IDS for block-based storage. IDStor acts as a listener to storage traffic, out of the controller's I/O path, and is therefore attractive for integration into existing SAN-based storage solutions. IDStor maintains a block-to-file mapping that is updated online. Using this mapping, IDStor infers the semantics of file-level commands from the intercepted block-level operations, thereby detecting file-level intrusions by merely observing the block read and write commands passing between the hosts and the controller.","","978-1-4244-7152-2","978-1-4244-7153-9","10.1109/MSST.2010.5496974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496974","","Access protocols;Control systems;Event detection;File systems;Home appliances;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor systems;Storage area networks;Telecommunication traffic","file organisation;security of data;storage area networks","SAN block storage controller;block level protocol;file level command;file level intrusion detection system;storage area network;storage controller","","1","","18","","","3-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High performance security analytics is proposed to address this challenge by which the real-time event information can be normalized, centralized, and correlated to help identify the current running state of the target environment. As an example of next generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Security Analytics Lab (SAL) has been designed and implemented based on the newly emerged In-Memory data management technique, which makes it possible to efficiently organize, access, and process different types of event information through a consistent central storage and interface. In this paper, the multi-core architecture is introduced on the event correlation module of SAL platform by which the correlation tasks can be executed in parallel by different computing resources. The k-means algorithm is implemented as an example of possible event clustering and correlation algorithms. Several experiments are conducted and analyzed to show that the performance of analytics can be significantly improved by applying multi-core architecture in the event correlation procedure.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2013.6717881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717881","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Security","multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;pattern clustering;security of data;storage management","IT-Infrastructure;SAL platform;SIEM platform;application logs;central interface;central storage;computing resources;correlation algorithms;correlation tasks;event clustering;event correlation module;high performance security analytics;in-memory data management technique;k-means algorithm;management methods;multicore architecture;next generation security information and event management platform];real-time event information;real-time events;security analytics lab;security event correlation;system logs","","0","","8","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have been exploring deliberate deception in defensive tactics by information systems under cyber-attack as during information warfare. We have developed a tool to systematically ""counterplan"" or find ways to foil a particular attack plan. Our approach is to first find all possible atomic ""ploys"" that can interfere with the plan. Ploys are simple deceits the operating system can do such as lying about the status of a file. We analyze ploys as to the degree of difficulty they cause to the plan wherever they can be applied. We then formulate a ""counterplan"" by selecting the most cost-effective set of ploys and assign appropriate presentation methods for them, taking into account the likelihood that, if we are not careful, the attacker will realize they are being deceived and will terminate our game with them. The counterplan can be effected by a modified operating system. We have implemented our counterplanner in a tool MECOUNTER that uses multiagent planning coupled with some novel inference methods to efficiently find a best counterplan. We apply the tool to an example of a rootkit-installation plan and discuss the results.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232425","","Access control;Computer hacking;Decision theory;Displays;Information systems;Intelligent agent;Military computing;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Technological innovation","computer crime;inference mechanisms;information systems;military computing;multi-agent systems;operating systems (computers);planning (artificial intelligence)","MECOUNTER tool;cyber-attack plan foil;decision theory;inference method;information system;information warfare;military strategy;multiagent planning;operating system;rootkit installation plan;stochastic model","","0","","17","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualisation is the key to consolidate the computing resources to run multiple instances on each hardware, increasing the utilization rate of every resource, thus reduces the number of resources needed to buy, rack, power, cool, and manage. Cloud computing has very appealing features, however, lots of enterprises and users are still reluctant to move into cloud due to serious security concerns related to virtualisation layer. Thus, it is foremost important to secure the virtual environment. In this paper, we present an elastic framework to secure virtualised environment for trusted cloud computing called Server Virtualisation Security System (SVSS). SVSS provide security solutions located on hypervisor for Virtual Machines by deploying malicious activity detection techniques, network traffic analysis techniques, and system resource utilization analysis techniques. SVSS consists of four modules: Anti-Virus Control Module, Traffic Behavior Monitoring Module, Malicious Activity Detection Module and Virtualisation Security Management Module.

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. The authors of T. Park and K.G. Shin, (2005) proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV). This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network. We implement and evaluate both the DAPP and the PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops. We also analyze the security of DAPP under different attack models, demonstrating its capability to deal with various types of attacks","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198821","","Authentication;Capacitive sensors;Communication system security;Computer security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Network servers;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Blundo scheme;Mica2 Motes;distributed authentication;distributed authentication protocol;node capture;physical tampering;program integrity verification;sensor program manipulation;severe resource constraints;soft tamper-proofing scheme;wireless sensor networks security","","1","4","22","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, sensor nodes are henceforth considered as Internet hosts and may act freely as web clients or servers. Undoubtedly, security and end-users privacy issues rise and become more severe in the IoT, due to the asymmetric nature of the communications between sensor nodes and the ordinary Internet hosts. Many solutions propose to use the classical IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints by either messages compression or computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression model for HIP (Host Identity Protocol) header, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of the computational load in HIP's key agreement process. For an extreme lightweight end-to-end security, we propose to combine both compression and distribution models for HIP in WSNs side, in the IoT. The partial evaluation results show that the proposed protocol, named compressed and distributed HIP (CD-HIP), is more adapted than the standard HIP, while introducing minor header communication overhead.","","978-1-4799-6608-0","","10.1109/NGNS.2014.6990267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990267","6LoWPAN compression;Host Identity Protocol;Internet of Tinhgs;IoT;Wireless Sensor Networks;distributed HIP Base Exchange;end-to-end security","Hip;IP networks;Internet;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;Internet;Internet of Things;file servers;personal area networks;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN;CD-HIP;IP-based security protocols;IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks;Internet of Things;IoT;WSN;Web clients;Web servers;communication overhead;compressed and distributed HIP;computational-load distribution techniques;distribution scheme;end-to-end security;host identity protocol;messages compression;wireless sensor networks","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The training points which are unable to become the furthest point are ruled out. In addition, the support vectors weights can be updated once in a certain number of iterations to reduce the calculation amount.

The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory. To reduce the impact of the memory gap, we also propose three enhancement algorithms to improve performance: 1) a skipping algorithm; 2) a cache method; and 3) a prefetching mechanism.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2119382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5740396","Algorithmic attacks;embedded system;memory gap;network security;virus detection","Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Memory management;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Security;System-on-a-chip","authorisation;cache storage;computer network security;computer viruses;information filtering;microprocessor chips;pattern matching","antivirus;cache method;embedded network security;exact-matching engine;filtering engine;firewall routers;large pattern set;memory gap impact reduction;merged shift table;network attack protection;off-chip data accessing;off-chip memory;pattern matching;performance improvement;prefetching mechanism;scalable high-performance virus detection processor;skipping algorithm;systematic virus detection hardware solution;two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor","","0","","25","","2011-03-28","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds. Under the same attack scenario, DDoS Shield improves the victims' performance to 1.5 seconds.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2008.926503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555692","Anomaly detection;application layer attacks;denial-of-service attacks;information entropy;site security monitoring","","authorisation;security of data","DDoS-Shield;DDoS-resilient scheduling;application layer attacks;application workload parameters;application-layer requests;distributed denial of service","","27","1","35","","2008-07-02","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE International Conference on","20091208","2009","","","221","226","Deep packet inspection at high speed has become extremely important due to its application in a wide range of network applications, such as network security and network monitoring. Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) uses a collection of signatures of known security threats and viruses to scan the payload of each packet. Signatures are often specified in the form of regular expressions (regex), called patterns, which are traditionally implemented as finite automata. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is fast, but requires prohibitive amounts of memory which limits their practical use. Instead of matching an incoming packet with each individual regex in a ruleset, we match the packet with a fixed substring, called fingerprint, of a regex first. Fixed string matching is faster and consumes less energy than regex matching. The fact is that if a packet does not match with the fingerprint of a regex, it will not match the regex itself. So fingerprints can be used in a prefilter engine to filter out those packets and do not match any of the fingerprints of the regex in a rule set, which represents normal non-malicious traffic. This actually reduces the number of regex rules being matched, which results in increased throughput of the NIDS. We present a weight scheme to extract a good fingerprint from a regex. A good fingerprint is the one that not only indicates the regex uniquely, but also occurs as less as possible in the matching procedure. We demonstrate how to use fingerprints for efficient prefiltering by means of Bloom filters in practice.","","978-1-4244-4816-6","978-1-4244-4817-3","10.1109/ICCOMTA.2009.5349207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349207","bloom filter;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;prefilter;weight scheme","Automata;Computer viruses;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Filters;Fingerprint recognition;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads","computer viruses;digital signatures;feature extraction;filtering theory;fingerprint identification;finite automata;string matching","Bloom filters;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;fingerprint extraction;fixed string matching;network intrusion detection system;network monitoring;network security;normal nonmalicious traffic;regex matching;regular expressions;ruleset;security threats","","2","2","10","","","16-18 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many recent reports on intrusion from external hackers which compromised the database system. However, there are also insiders who abuse their privileges and access the database system for many intentions. For that reason, it is imperative for us to secure database system from both external and internal attacks.

Social analysis methods are applied to these matrices to detect suspicious behaviors of mobile nodes. NS-2 simulation results show that this SN-IDS system can effectively detect common attacks with high detection rates and low false positive alarm rates.

One of the main reasons is insecure routing protocol. Generally ad-hoc network operations utilize reactive routing protocol such as AODV, to complete their routing needs. The route construction phase of this protocol is vulnerable; the malicious node easily disrupts the communication. In one case malicious node sends bulk route request (RREQ) packets to void addresses that occupy the network resources. This type of attack is called RREQ Flooding Attack (RFA). There are various schemes to mitigate the RFA but they are inadequate towards mitigating the attack. One of the main issues present in majority of proposed solutions is not to recover malicious node after punishment. This paper introduces RFAP, a scheme for mitigating the RREQ flooding attack in MANET by utilizing AODV protocol. The RFAP is an amended form of AODV. The scheme is specially design for MANET that has higher node mobility. Recovery of malicious nodes after reasonable punishment is the main objective of the scheme. Simulations are performed using NS-2 simulator and results are presented. These results illustrate that RFAP has ability to separate the flooder node from the network with more reliable as compare to simple AODV.","","978-1-4673-2249-2","","10.1109/INMIC.2012.6511487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511487","AODV;Attack;Flooding attack;MANETs;RFAP;Reactive Routing","","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","AODV;MANET;RFAP;RREQ packets;bulk route request;mobile ad-hoc networks;preventive measure;reactive routing protocol;route request flooding attack","","1","","30","","","13-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DCs perform the vital role of combining signals from the host tissue and correlate these signals with proteins known as antigens. In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion based on time-windows. The whole population of DCs asynchronously correlates the fused signals with a secondary data stream. The behaviour of human DCs is abstracted to form the DC Algorithm (DCA), which is implemented using an immune inspired framework, libtissue.

Searching through entire packet headers and payloads, NIDSs can identify and classify the packets that contain malicious patterns. The most essential technology to the NIDS is an efficient multiple-pattern matching algorithm, which performs exact string matching between packets and a large set of patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical multiple-pattern matching algorithm (HMA) for intrusion detection, which is a two-tier and cluster-wise matching algorithm. HMA drastically reduces the amount of external memory access as well as required memory space, enabling an efficient and cost-effective real-time IDS. The simulations show that HMA significantly improves the matching performance in both the average and the worst cases (about 1.7-63 times better than the state-of-the-art algorithms).","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577938","","Clustering algorithms;Data security;Databases;Engines;Information security;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protection","computer networks;pattern matching;security of data;telecommunication security","cluster-wise matching algorithm;hierarchical multiple-pattern matching algorithm;malicious patterns;network security threats;network-based intrusion detection system;packet headers;payloads;string matching;two-tier matching algorithm","","2","1","17","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is proposed to give a general framework for IDS based on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics and agent technology. Our approach is focused on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. To achieve low false positive rate in this framework the intrusion can be detected by means of comparing the signature of the current user's session with already existing signatures of the potential intruder. The algorithms of computational biology such as approximation algorithm and Carillo-Lippman heuristic algorithm and sum-of-pairs scoring function are used to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder, the user signature and past intruder's signatures.

Considering the large size of training data and time-consuming labeling task, it is wise to select some informative data to train a classifier. Active learning is a family of approaches selecting samples for labeling to build classifier with maximum prediction accuracy. So it is able to improve the performance of intrusion detection while it is not time-costing and labor-consuming. In this paper, definition and some efficient query strategies of active learning are reviewed and suggested. Some popular algorithms of intrusion detection and the combination of active learning and intrusion detection are also introduced.

IEEE International Symposium on","20080507","2008","","","32","43","This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).","","978-1-4244-2232-6","978-1-4244-2233-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736","","Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn","computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion","","4","","22","","","20-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to absence of infrastructure, MANET is used in various applications, such as battlefield, business applications, and remote areas. As, communication among the nodes is through the insecure wireless link, security is very important issue for this type of networks. MANET is vulnerable to attacks such as Black hole attack, Gray hole attack, wormhole attack, Sybil attack, and Route table modification attack. Black hole attack has serious impact on routing and delivery ratio of packets. To overcome Black hole attack, a mechanisms such as trust based routing, intrusion detection system, sequence number comparison and Data Routing Information table (DRI) has been proposed. Trust based On Demand routing mechanism identifies and decreases the hazards by malicious node in the path. This paper provides a survey of preventing and identifying Black hole attack using trust management mechanism in MANET.","","","","10.1049/ic.2011.0087","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193576","Black hole attack;MANET;Trust;reputation;security","","mobile ad hoc networks;radio links;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;trusted computing","MANET;Sybil attack;autonomous system;black hole attack;data routing information table;demand routing;gray hole attack;insecure wireless link;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile ad-hoc network;mobile node;network security;packet delivery ratio;route table modification attack;sequence number comparison;trust based routing;trust management;wormhole attack","","2","","","","","14-15 Nov. 2011","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Anomaly detection is a pattern recognition task whose goal is to report the occurrence of abnormal or unknown behavior in a given system being monitored. This paper presents a dynamic anomaly detection scheme that can effectively identify a group of especially harmful internal attackers - masqueraders in cellular mobile networks. Our scheme uses the trace data of wireless application layer by a user as feature value. Based on this, the use pattern of a mobile's user can be captured by rough sets, and the abnormal behavior of the mobile can be also detected effectively by applying a roughness membership function with both the age of the user profile and weighted feature values.

The purpose of this research is to construct a holistic solution that is able to firstly reduce the number of alerts to be processed and at the same time produce a high quality attack scenarios that are meaningful to the administrators in a timely manner. To achieve these goals, alerts generated by IDS sensors need to be correlated and organized in an appropriate approach. Thus the significant contribution of this research is to create an integrated operational framework for alert processing that reduces the amount of alerts to be processed and creates more meaningful attack scenarios to be analyzed.

PSCE '06. 2006 IEEE PES","20070205","2006","","","641","649","Ethernet-based local area networks (LANs) have become an indispensable tool that promises to revolutionize power system communications. Recent advances in Ethernet-based technology have taken this industry from shared 10 Mbps LAN segments to switched 100 Mbps LANs followed by 1 Gbps backbones for metropolitan area networks (MANs) and more recently 10 Gbps Ethernet technology for use in wide-area networks (WANs). Up until now, intersubstation communications typically have been provided by a SONET/SDH communication infrastructure. Although well understood and widely deployed, this legacy approach is not optimized for data traffic and requires protocol mapping and/or translation at both ends of the interface. The more recent trend of migrating towards voice over IP services combined with the advent of low-cost gigabit Ethernet switches and low-cost long-haul fiber optics has made it possible to deploy native Ethernet networks in wide-area applications. This paper looks at the new capabilities in substation automation, protection, and control made possible by native intersubstation Ethernet. Analysis is made of the current capabilities of this technology and state of the art tools available for Ethernet network management. The paper also examines application examples such as: Ethernet-based POTT protection schemes and synchrophasor data collection infrastructure. It concludes with a short overview of future application trends, including Ethernet-based line differential example","","1-4244-0177-1","1-4244-0178-X","10.1109/PSCE.2006.296394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4075833","","Communication switching;Ethernet networks;Local area networks;Metropolitan area networks;Optical fiber LAN;Power system protection;SONET;Spine;Substation protection;Synchronous digital hierarchy","Internet telephony;SONET;computer network management;optical fibre LAN;power engineering computing;substation automation;substation protection;synchronous digital hierarchy;wide area networks","MAN;POTT protection applications;SONET/SDH communication;data traffic;fiber optics;gigabit Ethernet switches;intersubstation communications;legacy approach;local area networks;metropolitan area networks;network management;power system communications;protocol mapping;substation LAN;substation automation;synchrophasor data collection;voice over IP services;wide-area Ethernet","","3","","6","","","Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters σ and ν, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project.","","","","10.1109/QSHINE.2014.6928673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928673","","Data models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;SCADA systems;Training","SCADA systems;radial basis function networks;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","CockpitCI project;K-means recursive clustering;OCSVM model;RBF kernel;SCADA systems;intrusion detection;malicious network traffic;one-class support vector machine;recursive k-means clustering;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unsafe channels","","0","","6","","","18-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel. We finally present a scenario of intrusion in a web service running on multiple hosts, and show how our distributed IDS is able to report security violations at each host level.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654811","","Containers;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Protocols;Security","operating system kernels;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Linux kernel;Linux security module;distributed information flow policy;distributed intrusion detection;distributed systems;inter rocess communication abstractions;memory mappings;network packets;peer to peer fashion;security labels;taint marking","","0","","18","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
