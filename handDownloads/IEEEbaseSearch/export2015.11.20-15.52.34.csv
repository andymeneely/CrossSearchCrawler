However, the NSA requires the alert analysis techniques to offer high-level information such as how serious of attacks are and how dangerous of devices are and which attacks or devices need administrator to pay attention to. To address this problem, we propose a time and space based alert analysis technique which can correlate related alerts without background knowledge and offer attack graph to help the administrator understand the attack steps clearly and efficiently. And a threat evaluation is given to find the most dangerous attack, which further saves administrator's time and energy in processing large amount alerts.","","978-1-4244-8224-5","","10.1109/ICCCAS.2010.5582005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582005","","Data mining;Equations;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Servers","computer network security","attack graph;high-level information;intrusion detection;network situation awareness;space based alert analysis;threat evaluation;time based alert analysis","","0","","9","","","28-30 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We assume that the effect of each active intrusion on a particular significant measure is superimposed on the normal operation of that measure; thus, we are able to obtain a complete representation of the overall bipartite graph model by superimposing the simpler graphs associated with each individual intrusion. The key ingredient of our MIDS is the development of a modified belief propagation max-product algorithm (MPA) that avoids the exponential complexity of the original MPA by limiting, during the iteration process, the number of active intrusions that are connected to a particular measure. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed MIDS performs well in detecting both single and multiple intrusions with a very low false alarm rate.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598827","Bayesian network;belief propagation algorithm;intrusion detection;multiple intrusion model;naive Bayesian network model","Application software;Bayesian methods;Belief propagation;Bipartite graph;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Particle measurements","graph theory;security of data","belief propagation;graphical inference;max-product algorithm;multiple intrusion detection system;weighted bipartite graph","","2","","37","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Network traffic is characterized using a novel technique that maps packet-level payloads onto a set of counters using bit-pattern hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components and has the potential to provide accurate detection performance due to the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space.

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and shift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic.","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635545","Alert Correlation;Data Quality;Intrusion Detection;Security","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Intrusion detection;Organizing;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;telecommunication security","DARPA 2000 network traffic;false positives reduction;filtering routers;firewalls;intrusion alert quality framework;security monitoring sensors","","2","","22","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms. The IT2 FLS was used to model the linguistic uncertainty in describing the relationship between various network communication attributes and the possibility of a cyber attack. The proposed method was tested on an experimental smart grid system demonstrating enhanced cyber-security.","","978-1-4673-0161-9","978-1-4673-0162-6","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309292","Anomaly Detection;Critical Systems;Cyber Sensor;Domain Knowledge;Fuzzy Logic System;Smart Grid","Detection algorithms;Feature extraction;Frequency selective surfaces;Fuzzy logic;Pragmatics;Sensitivity;Telecommunication traffic","fuzzy logic;security of data;smart power grids","IT2 FLS;anomaly detection algorithms;anomaly detection solution;cyber-security measures;false negatives rates;false positive rates;interval type-2 fuzzy logic system;linguistic domain knowledge;normal network behavior models;novel anomaly detection architecture;planned large scale deployment;smart grid network devices;smart grid systems","","2","","25","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost. The proposed approach demonstrates that interactive visualization can be successfully combined with network security mechanisms to greatly improve the intrusion detection capabilities","","1-4244-0591-2","1-4244-0592-0","10.1109/VAST.2006.261435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4035753","C.2.0 [Computer-Communication Networks]: GeneralÂ¿Security and protection;H.5.2 [Information Systems]: Information Interfaces and PresentationÂ¿User interfaces;Interactive Detection;Topology Visualization;Visualization on Network Security;Wireless Networks;Wormhole Attacks","Communication system security;Detection algorithms;Hardware;Information security;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Visualization;Wireless networks","data visualisation;radio networks;security of data;telecommunication security","automatic detection algorithm;interactive visualization of wormholes;interactive wormhole detection;intrusion detection;large scale wireless network;network topology visualization;routing protocol;user interaction","","3","","43","","","Oct. 31 2006-Nov. 2 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing attack detection approaches based on statistical learning methods may generate misleading decision boundaries when processing noisy data with such a mixture of benign and malicious behaviors. On the other hand, attack detection based on formal program analysis may lack completeness or adaptivity when modelling attack behaviors. In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data. Our extensive evaluation shows that, compared with pure statistical learning models, LEAPS achieves consistently higher accuracy when detecting real-world camouflaged attacks with benign program cover-up.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266838","Attack Detection;Program Analysis;Statistical Learning","Data models;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Libraries;Payloads;Statistical learning;Training","flow graphs;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;program testing;security of data;statistical analysis","LEAPS;attack detection system;camouflaged attack detection;cyberinfrastructures;formal program analysis;malicious system events;statistical learning methods;supervised statistical learning methods;testing data","","","","","","","22-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of this profile data is currently based on command-line instructions/directives executed by users on a system. With the advent and extensive usage of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line data can no longer fully represent user's complete behavior which is essential for effectively detecting the anomalies in these GUI based systems. Collection of user behavior data is a slow and time consuming process. In this paper, we present a new approach to automate the generation of user data by parameterizing user behavior in terms of user intention (malicious/normal), user skill level, set of applications installed on a machine, mouse movement and keyboard activity. The user behavior parameters are used to generate templates, which can be further customized. The framework is called USim which can achieve rapid generation of user behavior data based on these templates for GUI based systems. The data thus generated can be utilized for rapidly training and testing intrusion detection systems (IDSes) and improving their detection precision.","1080-241X","0-7695-2559-8","","10.1109/ANSS.2006.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1612860","","Computational modeling;Computer science;Data engineering;Discrete event simulation;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Keyboards;Laboratories;Mice;System testing","graphical user interfaces;security of data","IDSes;USim;anomaly detection system;graphical user interface;intrusion detection system;user behavior simulation","","1","","25","","","2-6 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By intruding into the SCADA system via the remote access points, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data and reconfigure devices to trip the system breakers. The cyber attacks are able to impact the reliability of the power system through the SCADA system. In this paper, six cyber attack scenarios in the SCADA system are considered. A Bayesian attack graph model is used to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks on the SCADA system, which will result in breaker trips. A forced outage rate (FOR) model is proposed considering the frequencies of successful attacks on the generators and transmission lines. With increased FOR values resulted from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities (LOLP) in reliability test system 79 (RTS79) are estimated. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable as the frequency of successful attacks increases.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939397","Bayesian attack graph model;Cyber security;SCADA system;cyber-physical power systems;forced outage rate;loss of load probability;power system reliability","Bayes methods;Generators;Power system reliability;Reliability;SCADA systems;Substations","Bayes methods;SCADA systems;power engineering computing;power grids;power system reliability;power system security","Bayesian attack graph model;FOR model;LOLP;RTS79;SCADA system;critical data eavesdropping;cyber vulnerability;forced outage rate;loss of load probability;power grid reliability analysis;reliability test system 79;remote access point;supervisory control and data acquisition system;system breaker;system breaker trip","","0","","13","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, researchers have developed high performance parallel deep packet filters for reconfigurable devices. Although some reconfigurable systems can be generated automatically from pattern database, obtaining high performance result from each subsequent reconfiguration can be a time consuming process. We present a novel architecture for programmable parallel pattern matching coprocessor.

Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming. The proposed approach classifies and simplifies the long observation sequence by virtue of rough set reduction, and the decision conditions obtained in rough set reduction phase could be used in further detection. The experimental results indicate that this method can promote the model training efficiency.

Open Flow, a SDN standard, is currently the only standard that explicitly focuses on multi-vendor openness. Unfortunately, it only provides for traffic engineering on an integrated basis for L2-L4. The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice. Retention of multi-vendor openness for such an approach has not been previously reported in literature to the best of our knowledge. We report numerical results from our prototype, characterizing the performance and practicality of this prototype by implementing a video reconditioning application on this platform.","","978-1-4799-6203-7","","10.1109/ICNP.2014.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980433","","Delays;Engines;Hardware;Process control;Prototypes;Streaming media;Video recording","protocols;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","L7-based policies;Open Flow data path;SDN standard;data path flow table;deep packet inspection;external processing box;forwarding engines;forwarding equipment;multivendor openness;network operators;open paradigm;payload inspection;protocol extension;resource allocation policies;scalability barriers;service insertion;software defined networking;traffic characterization;traffic engineering;traffic steering;video reconditioning application","","0","","16","","","21-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method shows increase in the detection rate of about 20% compared to signature based IDS and 10% compared to anomaly based IDS. On the other hand the False alarm rate reduces by 40%.

Specifically, we consider the scenario where a sensor sends its data to a remote estimator through a wireless channel for state estimation, while an attacker decides whether to jam the channel at each sampling time. For two typical system performance indexes, i.e., the expected average estimation error and the expected terminal estimation error, we construct optimal attack scheduling schemes, respectively.

Consequently, based on the filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence of selection constructs dynamically captured at run-time, a selection-early strategy establishes the efficient evaluation sequence adaptively. For this purpose, the overall filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence is periodically monitored and the sequence is rearranged when its filtering capability is varied higher than a specific threshold. Accordingly, this strategy keeps the current evaluation sequence to be as efficient as possible by coping with a dynamic variation of its filtering capability.

A number of intrusion detection systems have been proposed for ad-hoc networks. Such intrusion detection systems cannot perform well for wireless mesh networks due to its multihop decentralized architecture. The selection of optimal and secure routing path and detection of multilayer security attacks cannot be achieved using traditional single layer IDS. Most of the MAC layer attacks occur due to non compliance of protocols by the nodes. Such a malicious behavior cannot be detected using conventional IDS. In this paper, a Cross Layer based Intrusion detection system has been proposed which takes advantage of the information available across different layers of protocol by activating multiple layer monitoring and detection. The proposed Cross layer based IDS is novel in its architecture and is able to detect multi layer attacks of compound nature.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","0","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks. DARPA 2000 intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and a testbed network were used to evaluate the innovative alert correlation model. Comparisons with a previous correlation system were performed. The results of processing these datasets and recognizing the attack patterns demonstrated the potential of the improved correlation model and gave favorable results.","","978-0-9893-1933-1","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918249","Alert Correlation;Alert Reduction;False Alarm Rate;Intrusion Detection Systems","Collaboration;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern recognition","security of data","CIDS;attack patterns;collaborative intrusion alert correlation;collaborative intrusion detection systems;correlation components;correlation process performance;correlation processing time;innovative alert correlation model;innovative framework;intruders intention;modified algorithm;security related activity","","0","","34","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 6th International Conference on","20040927","2004","1","","207","212","Supporting dynamic rule change with minimum packet loss is one of the key issues for intrusion detection. To detect intrusion, in general, Intrusion Detection System(IDS) has a copy step where P packet is captured at kernel level and it is used for detection in user level. While doing this job, the next packet cannot be captured because this procedure isn??t finished yet. This paper proposes the Kernel-level Intrusion Detection System(KIDS) which can detect various network attacks with minimum packet loss. This system is executed in kernel as a kernel program, and can detect intrusion at kernel level without copy step. Dynamic rule change is done quickly through appending and setting a delete mark operation. After this work, it is not needed to reboot a kernel and new type of network attack can be detected easily. With the help of this dynamic rule change, waiting time of detection process is minimized and its job can be continued as quickly as possible. Due to these features, the packet loss is greatly reduced.","","89-5519-119-7","","10.1109/ICACT.2004.1292859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292859","Intrusion Detection System;kernel-level intrusion detection;signature-based detection","Availability;Computer networks;Computer worms;Data security;Delta modulation;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Protection;Web and internet services","","","","1","","12","","","9-11 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study our assumption is based on an estimation that actual threats come from the actively exploited vulnerabilities. Information on exploit-targeted platforms and vulnerabilities could be easily collected from a large set of malicious websites and automatically turned into signatures. We propose an automated method of building such signatures and use those to analyse the reconnaissance data set to identify ranges of vulnerable systems.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820864","network security;reconnaissance;risk analysis;security evaluation;vulnerability assessment","Browsers;Data mining;Databases;IP networks;Internet;Reconnaissance","IP networks;Web sites;computer network security;data analysis;data mining;risk analysis","IP address;exploit-targeted platform;large network infrastructure reconnaissance;large network reconnaissance data mining;large network risk evaluation;malicious Websites;nation-wide passive network vulnerability assessment;national network;network vulnerability exposure measurement;nonintrusive method;reconnaissance data analysis;vulnerable systems","","0","","12","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo. Moreover, ns-2 simulation results show that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged, while energy savings of 20 to 100 times are achieved, depending on the scenario.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654513","Sensor networks;local monitoring;malicious nodes.;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna","Antennas;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Sleep;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","ELMO;WSN;energy aware local monitoring;energy constrained system;energy consumption;local monitoring based security algorithm;sleep wake management;wireless sensor network","","3","","40","","2010-12-03","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We discuss why these investigations are easier on a honeynet and how honeynets may be used to make investigations of compromised production machines faster and recovery easier.

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.","","978-1-4799-8098-7","","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064618","Excerpt Query;Hash-based traceback;Packet Attribution System;Payload Attribution System","Hafnium;IP networks","Internet;computer network security;data structures;digital forensics;optimisation;quality of service;query processing;telecommunication network routing","AS;Internet security;NMS;QoS;autonomous system;bloom filters;excerpt query process optimization;network forensic technique;packet attribution system;packet data store;routing task;source traceback","","0","","18","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when looking at solutions that have been proposed to address VANET security issues, it emerges that guaranteeing security in VANET essentially amounts to resorting to cryptographic-centric mechanisms. Although the use of public key Infrastructure (PKI) fulfills most VANET' security requirements related to physical properties of the wireless transmissions, simply relying on cryptography does not secure a network. This is the case for vulnerabilities at layers above the MAC layer. Because of their capability to bypass security policy control, they can still expose VANET, and thus, the ITS to cyber attacks. Thereby, one needs security solutions that go beyond cryptographic mechanisms in order cover multiple threat vectors faced by VANET. In this paper focusing on attack detection, we show how using an implementation combining observation of events and incidents from multiple sources at different layers Sybil nodes can be detected regardless of the VANET architecture.","","","","10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7245674","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS);Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) security;attack detection","Communication system security;Cryptography;IP networks;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","intelligent transportation systems;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","IEEE802.11p standard;VANET;attack detection;cryptographic-centric mechanisms;cyber attacks;intelligent transportation systems;mobile ad hoc network;security analytics;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless mobile environment","","0","","","","","5-7 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to prevent such leakage, we propose the Data Leakage Prevention System (DLPS) which is applied at the entrance of the enterprise network to filter out the outgoing sensitive information. The DLPS is based on a content scanning engine which defines a new type of matching problem, called longest overlap matching which also exits in many other applications as a basic problem where contents are delivered by small blocks. We study the problem by comparing it with the traditional pattern matching problem in Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) whose solutions are based on finite automata. We develop a new finite automata representation called Skip-Finite Automata (Skip-FA) which detects the packets carrying sensitive information by using default transitions to implicitly track the overlapping parts between packets' payloads and sensitive files. The simulation results shows that our system achieves a matching speed of about 10B+ per memory access for small file set (>;20KB) and 100B+ per memory access for large file set (>;2500KB). We also find that the memory consumption of Skip-FA is almost the same to that of the original files.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683165","","Automata;Delay;Engines;IEEE Communications Society;Logic gates;Payloads;Radiation detectors","finite automata;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","content scanning engine;data leakage prevention system;deep packet inspection;file sharing network;finite automata representation;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching problem;secure enterprise network;skip finite automata;skip finite automaton","","1","","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In present literatures, most of IDS models in WSN are static IDS (SIDS), which have inherent disadvantages and are not feasible for WSN. This paper proposes a dynamic model of IDS (DIDS) for WSN, which has a remarkable improvement in the security, stability and robustness issues as compared to SIDS.

Thus, the capability to proactively infer malicious activities is of paramount importance. In this context, inferring probing events, which are commonly the first stage of any cyber attack, render a promising tactic to achieve that task. We have been receiving for the past three years 12 GB of daily malicious real darknet data (i.e., Internet traffic destined to half a million routable yet unallocated IP addresses) from more than 12 countries. This paper exploits such data to propose a novel approach that aims at capturing the behavior of the probing sources in an attempt to infer their orchestration (i.e., coordination) pattern. The latter defines a recently discovered characteristic of a new phenomenon of probing events that could be ominously leveraged to cause drastic Internet-wide and enterprise impacts as precursors of various cyber attacks. To accomplish its goals, the proposed approach leverages various signal and statistical techniques, information theoretical metrics, fuzzy approaches with real malware traffic and data mining methods. The approach is validated through one use case that arguably proves that a previously analyzed orchestrated probing event from last year is indeed still active, yet operating in a stealthy, very low rate mode. We envision that the proposed approach that is tailored towards darknet data, which is frequently, abundantly and effectively used to generate cyber threat intelligence, could be used by network security analysts, emergency response teams and/or observers of cyber events to infer large-scale orchestrated probing events for early cyber attack warning and notification.","","","","10.1109/INFCOMW.2014.6849283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849283","","Conferences;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Probes","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory;information theory;invasive software;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;coordination pattern;cyber attack;cyber threat intelligence;cyberspace;data mining methods;early cyber attack notification;early cyber attack warning;emergency response teams;fuzzy approaches;information theoretical metrics;large-scale orchestrated probing events;malicious activities;malicious real darknet data;malware traffic;network security analysts;orchestration pattern;routable unallocated IP addresses;signal techniques;statistical techniques","","0","","15","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cyber attacks against data readmission system threaten the security of smart grid. Hence, identifying and preventing the false data injection as early as possible becomes a critical issue. However, there is no existing solution that considers all aspects such as deployment cost and system efficiency. In this paper, we apply a light-weight watermarking technique to defend against false data injection attacks. To be specific, we add a secure watermark to real-time meter readings and transmit the watermarked data through high speed unsecured network. The utility can then correlate the watermarked data with the original watermark to detect the presence of false data injected by adversary. Our simulation results show that watermarking technique can effectively detect any false manipulation to the watermarked data at low cost.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364511","","Demodulation;Meter reading;Sensors;Smart grids;Watermarking","power engineering computing;power meters;power system economics;power system security;smart power grids;watermarking","architecture;cyber attack;data readmission system;deployment cost;efficient energy transmission;energy distribution;false data injection attack;false manipulation detection;high speed unsecured network;light-weight watermarking technique;power grid;real-time meter reading;reliable energy transmission;secure energy transmission;secure watermark;security;smart grid;system efficiency;watermarked data transmission","","1","","12","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently proposed traceback mechanisms are inadequate to address the traceback problem for the following reasons: they lack incentives for ISPs to deploy IP traceback in their networks; they do not scale to large scale distributed DoS attacks. In this paper, a novel IP traceback approach based on packet logging and deterministic packet marking (LDPM) is proposed, that significantly improves IP traceback in several aspects: (1) LDPM is built on a distributed hierarchical IP traceback system, and is simple to deploy. (2) LDPM uses a new IP header encoding scheme to store the complete identification information of a router into a single packet, thus it can protect the privacy of network topology and victims can identify attack ingress router with one packet. It also can cope with large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. (3) LDPM can manipulate the marking information at the edge ingress routers. Therefore, as a value-added services, ISPs can provide traceback business to their customers. Compared with previous traceback schemes, LDPM improves the performance and practicability of IP traceback.","","978-0-7695-3825-9","","10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341555","IP traceback;deterministic packet marking;distributed denial of service;network security;packet logging","Computer crime;Computer networks;Embedded computing;Encoding;IP networks;Information security;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Privacy;Protection","IP networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP header encoding scheme;IP spoofing attack;IP traceback mechanism;attack ingress router;deterministic packet logging;deterministic packet marking;distributed hierarchical IP traceback system;network topology privacy protection;single packet router","","3","","24","","","25-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although there is a rich literature in the field of secure multiparty computation techniques that preserve the privacy in a distributed systems, the ability of such systems to scale up horizontally (number of participants) and vertically (dataset per participant) is still limited. The key novelty of the architecture is the usage of a pseudo-random oracle functionality distributed among the organizations participating to the system for obfuscating the data, that allows for achieving a good level of privacy while guaranteing scalability in both dimensions.

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules. A worst-case analysis shows that the saving in hardware resources is achieved with a relatively small buffer space, currently available in cheap, low end, FPGA boards, with no impairment on the resulting throughput.","1946-1488","978-1-4244-7842-2","","10.1109/FPL.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694212","","","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based solution;NIDS;elastic buffers;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;reconfigurable rule matching core;reprogrammability;worst-case analysis","","5","","13","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method can be use as an alternative method to gain the proper attributes for the proposed domain data: Network Intrusion Data. MHGIS is modified from original Heuristic Greedy Algorithm of Itemset (HGIS) to increase efficiency for finding proper feature. In our work, we compare our result with the common method of feature selection is which the Chi-Square (Chi<sup>2</sup>) feature selection. There are 4 main steps in our experiment: Firstly, we start with data pre-processing to discard unnecessary attributes. Secondly, MHGIS feature selection and Chi<sup>2</sup> feature selection have been employed on the pre-processed data, to reduce the number of attributes. Thirdly, we measure the recognition performance by using supervised learning algorithms which are C4.5, BPNN, RBF and SVM. Lastly, we evaluate the results received from MHGIS and Chi<sup>2</sup>. From the KDDCup99 dataset, we got 13,499 randomly sampling patterns with 34 data dimensions. With the use of MHGIS and Chi<sup>2</sup> algorithms, we obtain 14 and 26 features respectively. The result shows that, the classification accuracies measure by C4.5 over the MHGIS selection algorithm produces better accuracies as compare to the Chi<sup>2</sup> feature selection and HGIS feature selection over all types of classification methods.","","978-1-4673-5578-0","","10.1109/ISCIT.2013.6645936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6645936","Feature Selection;Heuristc Greedy;Network Intrusion Detection;Pattern Recognition","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Greedy algorithms;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;security of data;support vector machines","BPNN algorithm;C4.5 algorithm;Chi<sup>2</sup> feature selection;KDDCup99 dataset;MHGIS feature selection;RBF algorithm;SVM algorithm;attributes reduction;backpropagation neural network;chi-square feature selection;classification accuracy;data pre-processing;intrusion feature selection;modified heuristic greedy algorithm of itemset;network intrusion data;radial basis function network;recognition performance;supervised learning algorithms;support vector machines","","1","","16","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
