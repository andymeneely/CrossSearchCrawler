A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","4","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

If the profiler cannot detect the expected behavior, it sends an alarm signal to the microprocessor for terminating program execution. Since attack code cannot anticipate the execution behavior required, malicious attacks can be detected and prohibited at the start of program execution.","","1-4244-0395-2","1-4244-0395-2","10.1109/ICECS.2006.379744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4263328","","Authentication;Buffer overflow;Computer displays;Computer security;Data security;Informatics;Information security;Intrusion detection;Microprocessors;Runtime","invasive software","attack code;authentication;computer security issues;dynamic program execution;dynamic program signature;execution behavior;hardware-based intrusion detection;intrusion detection framework;microprocessors;secret key information;secure compiler","","0","","11","","","10-13 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rapid increase number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In this paper, the semantic link network model is used for organizing multimedia resources. A whole model for generating the association relation between multimedia resources using semantic link network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, and mechanisms of the semantic link network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the semantic link network and multimedia resources provides a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. The tags and the surrounding texts of multimedia resources are used to measure their semantic association. The hierarchical semantic of multimedia resources is defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different in the proposed framework. The modules of semantic link network model are implemented to measure association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two evaluation methods, including clustering and retrieval, are performed, which shows the proposed method can measure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.","2168-6750","","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2316525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786371","Big data;multimedia resources;multimedia resources organization;semantic link network","Big data;Computational modeling;Data models;Multimedia communication;Ontologies;Semantics;Streaming media","Big Data;multimedia computing;semantic networks","Flickr images;association relation generation;clustering;multimedia big data;multimedia resource organization;retrieval;semantic link network-based model;social tags;surrounding text semantics;tag semantics","","5","","35","","2014-04-10","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Tenth International Conference on","20080415","2008","","","216","223","A Distributed Intrusion Prediction and Prevention Systems (DIPPS) not only detects and prevents possible intrusions but also possesses the capability to predict possible intrusions in a distributed network. Based on the DIPS sensors, instead of merely preventing the attackers or blocking traffic, we propose a fuzzy logic based online risk assessment scheme. The key idea of DIPPS is to protect the network(s) linked to assets, which are considered to be very risky. To implement DIPPS we used a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) with extended real time traffic surveillance and online risk assessment. To model and predict the next step of an attacker, we used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures the interaction between the attacker and the network. The interaction between various DIDS and integration of their output are achieved through a HMM. The novelty of this paper is the detailed development of Fuzzy Logic Controllers to estimate the various risk(s) that are dependent on several other variables based on the inputs from HMM modules and the DIDS agents. To develop the fuzzy risk expert system, if-then fuzzy rules were formulated based on interviews with security experts and network administrators. Preliminary results indicate that such a system is very practical for protecting assets which are prone to attacks or misuse, i.e. highly at risk.","","0-7695-3114-8","","10.1109/UKSIM.2008.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488934","distributed monitoring;fuzzy logic;internet security;intrusion prevention","Electronics packaging;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Hybrid intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Real time systems;Risk management;Telecommunication traffic","","","","5","","6","","","1-3 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our network features mainly consist of characteristics of IP address, port, protocol and some flags of packet header. These features are used to detect and classify behavior of internet worm by using 3 different data mining algorithms which are Bayesian Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In addition, our approach not only can classify internet worm apart from the normal data, but also can classify network attacks that have similar behaviors to the internet worm behaviors. Our approach provides good results with detection rate over 99.6 percent and false alarm rate is close to zero with Random forest algorithm.

The goal of the system is to create evanescent honeypots at right places and times, on demand, to achieve better security in this ever changing environment. The system finds the machines on the network which attackers are interested in using IDS alerts and network traffic analysis. Virtual honeypots replicating those systems are then created and deployed on the network. Suspicious traffic destined for the target system is then redirected to the newly created honeypot. Dormant honeypots are deleted periodically. Honeydoop can also be used to analyze existing honeypot logs.","","978-1-4673-5325-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470917","Hadoop;Honeypots;Virtual Honeypots","Databases;Organizations;Switches","data analysis;information retrieval;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Honeydoop;IDS alerts;data analyzer Hadoop;dormant honeypots;information analysis;information retrieval;network traffic analysis;on-demand virtual high interaction honeypots;virtual honeypots","","1","","7","","","10-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture forms a reliable basis for an intrusion recovery system (IRS). The spine architecture is a multi-tiered approach, relying on the integrity of a small μ-kernel based hypervisor for correctness at the base level. Spine vertebrae are positioned at each level in the system in order to overcome the semantic gap in the understanding of system state. We discuss the design of the system, highlighting the main advantages and disadvantages from other approaches. A series of attacks are conducted against the prototype system in order to test for correctness and time to recover. Finally, some system performance benchmarks are presented that show that a small performance penalty is incurred from the increased reliability.","","0-7695-2426-5","","10.1109/IWCIP.2005.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1572283","Integrity;Operating Systems;Recovery;Rootkits","Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Protection;Prototypes;Reliability engineering;Spine;System performance;System testing;Virtual machine monitors","operating system kernels;security of data","μ-kernel based system architecture;intrusion recovery system;spine architecture;spine vertebrae","","0","","15","","","3-4 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposed approach uses multiple network connections between a pair of communicating hosts to transmit covert data. Hence this covert channel is unaffected by underlying unpredictable network conditions. The concealed data is embedded in the order and sequence of connections to/from which regular (cover) packets of data are sent/received.

This paper presents a new protection method called a nozzle. The nozzle is based upon favorable aspects of firewalls and network pumps. It is deployed similar to a firewall such that all conversations from an untrusted user to a critical resource are monitored. The main advantage of the nozzle is the ability to provide a threshold for trusted traffic thus precluding new attacks. A nozzle consists of a series of rings. Each of which has a trusted and untrusted buffer, rules for packet placement, and rules for communication with the next level.

The DWIDS applies the principles of the computer immunology to IDS; that is to say, several different detection agents work coordinately and distributedly in each AP and cooperate with each other to detect intrusions. The self-learning mechanism of the sandbox not only studies the unknown intrusions, but also abstracts the rules and collects the evidence.

In particular, attack attribution and situational understanding are considered critical aspects to effectively deal with emerging, increasingly sophisticated Internet attacks. This requires highly scalable analysis tools to help analysts classify, correlate and prioritise security events, depending on their likely impact and threat level. However, this security data mining process typically involves a considerable amount of features interacting in a non-obvious way, which makes it inherently complex. To deal with this challenge, we introduce MR-TRIAGE, a set of distributed algorithms built on MapReduce that can perform scalable multi-criteria data clustering on large security data sets and identify complex relationships hidden in massive datasets. The MR-TRIAGE workflow is made of a scalable data summarisation, followed by scalable graph clustering algorithms in which we integrate multi-criteria evaluation techniques. Theoretical computational complexity of the proposed parallel algorithms are discussed and analysed. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithms can scale well and efficiently process large security datasets on commodity hardware. Our approach can effectively cluster any type of security events (e.g., spam emails, spear-phishing attacks, etc) that are sharing at least some commonalities among a number of predefined features.","","","","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004285","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Electronic mail;Open wireless architecture;Prototypes;Security","Big Data;computer crime;data mining;graph theory;parallel algorithms;pattern clustering","Big Data security intelligence applications;Internet attacks;MR-TRIAGE workflow;MapReduce;attack attribution;commodity hardware;computational complexity;distributed algorithms;large security data sets;large security datasets;multicriteria evaluation techniques;parallel algorithms;scalable data summarisation;scalable graph clustering algorithms;scalable multicriteria data clustering;security companies;security data mining;security events;situational understanding;threat level","","0","","56","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is an inseparable part of the information security system. Due to rapid development of attack pattern it is necessary to develop a system which can upgrade itself as new threats are detected. Also detection rate should be high because the rate with which attack is carried out on the network is very high. In response to this problem Pattern Based Algorithm is proposed which has high detection rate as well as low false alarm rate. In this algorithm decision stumps are used as weak classifier. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. Weak classifier for continuous features and weak classifier for categorical features are combined to form a strong classifier. Strategies for avoiding the over fitting are adopted to improve the performance of the algorithm.","","978-1-4244-8844-5","978-1-4244-8845-2","10.1109/ICCTD.2010.5645870","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645870","Intrusion Detection System;Machine Learning;Neural Networks;Pattern Based Algorithm;Security","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision support systems;Feature extraction;Labeling;Probes;Support vector machines","computer network security;decision trees","attack pattern;decision stumps;information security system;network intrusion detection;pattern based network security","","0","1","35","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the contemporary signaling protocol used in VoIP Networks. The protocol itself is vulnerable to most of the threats that happen in VoIP Networks. Regardless to register highly scalable incidents, it is widely considered by experts as the futuristic target for attackers. This survey provides extensive and comprehensive analysis of various security threats faced by VoIP Networks. Also this paper exemplifies major defense mechanisms and their proposed techniques to combat the threats. Apart from that, this paper discusses open-source tools that can be simulated to conduct experiments.

"IDGraphs: intrusion detection and analysis using histographs","Pin Ren; Yan Gao; Zhichun Li; Yan Chen; Watson, B.","","Visualization for Computer Security, 2005. (VizSEC 05). IEEE Workshop on","20051114","2005","","","39","46","Traffic anomalies and attacks are commonplace in today's networks and identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. For a statistical intrusion detection system (IDS), it is crucial to detect at the flow-level for accurate detection and mitigation. However, existing IDS systems offer only limited support for: 1) interactively examining detected intrusions and anomalies; 2) analyzing worm propagation patterns; 3) and discovering correlated attacks. These problems are becoming even more acute as the traffic on today's high-speed routers continues to grow. IDGraphs is an interactive visualization system for intrusion detection that addresses these challenges. The central visualization in the system is a flow-level trace plotted with time on the horizontal axis and aggregated number of unsuccessful connections on the vertical axis. We then summarize a stack of tens or hundreds of thousands of these traces using the histographs (Pin Ren and Watson, 2005) technique, which maps data frequency at each pixel to brightness. Users may then interactively query the summary view, performing analysis by highlighting subsets of the traces. For example, brushing a linked correlation matrix view highlights traces with similar patterns, revealing distributed attacks that are difficult to detect using standard statistical analysis. We apply IDGraphs system to a real network router data-set with 179M flow-level records representing a total traffic of 1.16TB. The system successfully detects and analyzes a variety of attacks and anomalies, including port scanning, worm outbreaks, stealthy TCP SYN floodings, and some distributed attacks.","","0-7803-9477-1","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532064","","Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Computer security;Computer worms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Invasive software;Management information systems;Protection;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security","IDGraphs;correlated attack discovery;distributed attacks;flow-level trace;histographs;interactive visualization system;port scanning;statistical intrusion detection system;stealthy TCP SYN flooding;traffic anomaly;worm outbreaks;worm propagation pattern analysis","","7","1","31","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtual machines are becoming increasing popular for deploying servers because they allow checkpointing and live migration facilities. The challenges are dealing with non-virtual state elements, like ongoing network communications that can't be check-pointed, and recovering state changed between failure and the last check-point. Other complications include dependence on human intervention and precise timing so as not to revert to an un-healthy VM already in the state of compromise. This paper describes a Xen based middleware that pervasively detects terminated VM servers and reincarnates them in a safe state such that they don't lose connectivity to their network clients. It also attempts to isolate messages that caused the failure and generates rules to disallow them from effecting the newly reincarnated VM in the future. Since it essentially allows a VM to start a new life from a point in time before it got compromised, we dubbed it: a time-forking virtual machine (TFVM) following the Copenhagen school's ""many worlds theory"" that postulates that every historical event forks a new universe for every possible outcome. Currently TFVM works in the context of our particular application but we discuss how to extend our model to allow reincarnation of generalized services","","0-7695-2788-4","","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144882","","Checkpointing;Humans;Internet;Mission critical systems;Network servers;Telecommunications;Timing;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server","Internet telephony;middleware;telecommunication security;virtual machines","Internet;VoIP;Xen based middleware;Xen based time-forking virtual machines;human intervention;many worlds theory;mission-critical telecom servers;nonvirtual state elements;reincarnation security","","0","1","10","","","19-23 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MYSEA seeks to meet two compelling requirements, often assumed to be at odds: enforcing critical, mandatory security policies, and allowing access and collaboration in a familiar work environment. Recent additions to the MYSEA design expand the architecture to support a cloud of cross-domain services, hosted within a federation of multilevel secure (MLS) MYSEA servers. The MYSEA cloud supports single-sign on, service replication, and network-layer quality of security service. This new cross-domain, distributed architecture follows the consumption and delivery model for cloud services, while maintaining the federated control model necessary to support and protect cross-domain collaboration within the enterprise. The resulting architecture shows the feasibility of high-assurance, cross-domain services hosted within a community cloud suitable for inter-agency, or joint, collaboration.

YouTube, the most famous video sharing site, allows people to comment on videos with other people while Facebook and Twitter are important vectors into sharing videos. Both video channels and social networks are increasingly vulnerable attack targets. For example, social networks are also considerable spam and phishing vectors, and Adobe Flash as the premier video streaming application is associated with numerous software vulnerabilities. This is a good way for attackers to compromise sites with embedded Flash objects. In this paper, we present the technical background of the cross-domain mechanisms and the security implications. Several recent studies have demonstrated the weakness of the cross-domain policy, leading to session hijacking or the leakage of sensitive information. Current solutions to detect these vulnerabilities use a client-side approach.

Network Lab., Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ, USA","Information Forensics and Security, IEEE Transactions on","20140711","2014","9","8","1278","1287","Network security against possible attacks involves making decisions under uncertainty. Not only may one be ignorant of the place, the power, or the time of potential attacks, one may also be largely ignorant of the attacker's purpose. To illustrate this phenomenon, this paper proposes a simple Bayesian game-theoretic model of allocating defensive (scanning) effort among nodes of a network in which a network's defender does not know the adversary's motivation for intruding on the network, e.g., to bring the maximal damage to the network (for example, to steal credit card numbers or information on bank accounts stored there) or to infiltrate the network for other purposes (for example, to corrupt nodes for a further distributed denial of service botnet attack on servers). Due to limited defensive capabilities, the defender faces the dilemma of either: 1) focusing on increasing defense of the most valuable nodes, and in turn, increasing the chance for the adversary to sneak into the network through less valuable nodes or 2) taking care of defense of all the nodes, and in turn, reducing the level of defense of the most valuable ones. An explicit solution to this dilemma is suggested based on the information available to the defender, and it is shown how this information allows the authorities to increase the efficiency of a network's defense. Some interesting properties of the rivals' strategies are presented. Notably, the adversary's strategy has a node-sharing structure and the adversary's payoffs have a discontinuous dependence on the probability of the attack's type. This discontinuity implies that the defender has to take into account the human factor since some threshold values of this inclination in the adversary's behavior could make the defender's policy very sensitive to small perturbations, while in other situations it produces minimal impact.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2329241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827188","Bayesian equilibrium;computer networks;infrastructure networks;network protection;scan;search","Bayes methods;Computers;Forensics;Games;Jamming;Security;Uncertainty","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision making;game theory;human factors;probability","Bayesian game-theoretic model;adversary behavior;adversary motivation;adversary strategy;attack-type uncertainty;decision making;defensive capabilities;defensive effort;distributed denial of service botnet attack;human factor;network defender;network protection;network security;node-sharing structure","","4","","36","","2014-06-06","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, so far there is no signature based IDS which can work on resource constraint sensor nodes. This paper presents a dynamic coding mechanism, which helps in implementing a distributed signature based IDS (intrusion detection system) in IP-USN (IP based ubiquitous sensor networks).

In other words, first different sets of features are created by mapping the original features into new spaces where the samples are well separated, and then each base classifier is trained on one of these newly created features sets. The proposed method for constructing an ensemble of classifiers is a general method which may be used in any classification problem.

CSF '07. 20th IEEE","20070716","2007","","","311","325","Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.","1940-1434","0-7695-2819-8","","10.1109/CSF.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657","","Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","safety systems;security of data;software reliability","automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions","","9","2","50","","","6-8 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence it is difficult to apply PAYL on high speed, high bandwidth networks. We use CPP (content based payload partitioning) technique which divides the payload into different partitions depending on content of payload. PCNAD does payload based anomaly detection using a few CPP partitions. We demonstrate usefulness of the PCNAD on the 1999 DARPA IDS data set. We observed 97.06% accuracy on port 80 using only 62.64% packet payload length with small false positive rate.

The Netflow statistics is mainly used to allocate the weights for traffic routing by routers. A new algorithm is thus proposed to get efficiently maximum throughput by the traffic filtering, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in real network circumstances. The algorithm shows its advantages that it just occupies a small part of resources.

In this new approach, the need of large samples by the previous approach is reduced by using Support Vector Machine while maintaining the high quality clustering of k-Medoids. Simulations have been carried out by using Kyoto2006+ data sets in order to evaluate performance, accuracy, detection rate and false positive rate of the classification scheme.

A malicious node can constantly report incorrect information to other nodes in the network, which can lead to whole network down. The proposed work identifying malicious node using trust value in cluster based MANET is used to detect the malicious node in cluster. The cluster formation process is realized by grouping nearby nodes to form a cluster. To every cluster, cluster head is assigned based on the energy of the nodes. The trust value calculation is used to find the behavior of the node. It is calculated by Cluster Member (CM), direct and indirect trust value. The trust value of the cluster member is maintained in the counter table. During the data transmission time, the Cluster Head (CH) monitors its cluster member behavior. When any misbehavior is monitored by cluster head means, it sends the request about that misbehaving node to its nearby node (NN) to get the direct trust value (DTV). And also CH sends the request to other cluster members about that misbehaving node. If that cluster members are having value about that misbehaving node means, it sends the indirect trust value to the CH. Otherwise cluster members ignores the request send by CH. The goal of the proposed work is identify the malicious nodes in the cluster using the trust values in effective manner. Simulation result in NS-2 accurately predicts the performance of proposed scheme in terms of cluster energy level analysis, routing performance, system performance under varying network conditions.","","978-1-4799-4191-9","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993135","MANET;authentication;clustering;malicious node;services;trust","Artificial neural networks;Automata;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Routing protocols","data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DTV;IMTVCM;NS-2 simulation;ad hoc network;autonomous collection;cluster based MANET;cluster energy level analysis;cluster formation process;cluster head;counter table;data transmission time;dynamic topology;indirect trust value;malicious node;misbehaving node;mobile nodes;routing performance;trust value calculation;wireless links","","0","","12","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there is no appropriate solution for high-speed networks. This paper proposes a solution for diagnosing denial of service (DoS) and port scan attacks as a layer of defense. The proposed method attains high speed rate using a parallel data structure to filter out DoS and port scan attacks from network traffic before entering the intrusion detection system.

Thus, they present a significant challenge for cloud providers to comply with. As a result, the cloud providers are unable to provide SMEs with an assurance. In order to address these privacy and security issues, this paper presents the Cloud Data Security (CloudDataSec) project that aims to design cloud services adhering to government privacy laws. In particular, this paper introduces a six-layer security model for cloud computing and three level of security assurance for SMEs to take advantage of.

This approach has been chosen in order to create a flexible and cheap but reliable system, implemented using consumer electronics. Voice features are extracted by a short time cepstrum analysis, and face features are extracted using the eigenfaces technique. The recognition task is solved using the same Support Vector Machine for both voice and face features. The system learns the features of each person using SVM in a set-up phase, in which the two modalities are also bound together through a cross-anchoring learning rule based on the mutual exclusivity selection principle. In the running phase the system is able to recognize the identity of the person either using voice features, or face features or both.

Based on multidimensional resource service operators, we model the problem of trust evaluation as a process of multi-attribute decision-making, and develop an adaptive trust evaluation approach based on information entropy theory. This adaptive approach can overcome the limitations of traditional trust schemes, whereby the trusted operators are weighted manually or subjectively. As a result, using SOTS, the broker can efficiently and accurately prepare the most trusted resources in advance, and thus provide more dependable resources to users.

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.","","978-1-4799-8171-7","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081","Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data","Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","19","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we consider the signature detection technique and investigate the ability of various routing protocols to facilitate intrusion detection when the attack signatures are completely known. We show that reactive ad-hoc routing protocols suffer from a serious problem due to which it might be difficult to detect intrusions even in the absence of mobility. Mobility makes the problem of detecting intruders harder. We also investigate a relationship between the probability of detecting an intrusion and the number of nodes that must participate in the process of detecting intrusions.","1090-3038","0-7803-7954-3","","10.1109/VETECF.2003.1285405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285405","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Face detection;Hurricanes;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Routing protocols;Spread spectrum communication;Terrorism;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication security","multihop wireless links;routing protocols;signature based intrusion detection;wireless ad-hoc networks","","11","","3","","","6-9 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to verify the legitimacy of our analytical framework we have carried out detailed numerical simulations. Our simulations mimic the practical scenario where a system deployed using our framework must make a binary Yes/No “malicious decision” to each snapshot of the signal strength values obtained by base stations.

The defender strategically selects his classification policy: a threshold on the number of file server attacks. We model the interaction of the two players (spy and defender) as a nonzero-sum game: The defender needs to balance missed detections and false alarms in his objective function, while the spy has a tradeoff between attacking the file server more aggressively and increasing the chances of getting caught. We give a characterization of the Nash equilibria in mixed strategies, and demonstrate how the Nash equilibria can be computed in polynomial time. Our characterization gives interesting and non-intuitive insights on the players' strategies at equilibrium: The defender uniformly randomizes between a set of thresholds that includes very large values.

This paper focuses on regular expressions pattern matching engines implemented in reconfigurable hardware. A nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) based implementation was presented, which takes advantage of new basic building blocks to support more complex regular expressions than the previous approaches. The methodology is supported by a tool that automatically generates the circuitry for the given regular expressions, outputting VHDL representations ready for logic synthesis. Furthermore, techniques to reduce the area cost of our designs and maximize performance when targeting FPGAs were included. Experimental results show that our tool is able to generate a regular expression engine to match more than 500 IDS regular expressions (from the Snort ruleset) using only 25K logic cells and achieving 2 Gbps throughput on a Virtex2 and 2.9 on a Virtex4 device. Concerning the throughput per area required per matching non-meta character, our design is 3.4 and 10 times more efficient than previous ASIC and FPGA approaches, respectively","","0-7803-9729-0","0-7803-9729-0","10.1109/FPT.2006.270302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4042424","","Automata;Circuits;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;hardware description languages;logic design;pattern matching;security of data","FPGA;Snort ruleset;VHDL;Virtex;expression matching;intrusion detection systems;logic synthesis;nondeterministic finite automata;nonmeta character;reconfigurable hardware;reconfigurable packet inspection;regular expressions pattern matching engines;static patterns","","23","2","19","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, to further explore the efficacy of MC, this paper presents a new attempt in the application of SN P system and as well provides a novel idea and method for attack detection. The extension of SN P system called trapezoidal Fuzzy Reasoning Spiking Neural P (tFRSN P) system is adopted in the network intrusion prediction model. SN P system is a neural-like computing model inspired from the way spiking neurons communicate using spikes. It has a graphical modeling advantage which makes it well suited for fuzzy reasoning as well as fuzzy knowledge representation. In order to evaluate the performance of tFRSN P system in intrusion detection, the publicly available KDD Cup benchmark dataset was employed. After the experiments, our results yielded very high detection rate of 99.78% and very low false alarm rate of 0.16% for Brute Force Attack (BFA).","","978-1-4799-8011-6","","10.1109/ACMC.2014.7065804","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065804","Cyber-security;Fuzzy reasoning;Intrusion Detection;P System;Rule-based System","Computational modeling;Force;Fuzzy reasoning;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Tin","biocomputing;fuzzy reasoning;knowledge representation;neural nets;security of data","BFA;attack detection;brute force attack;distributed parallel computing model;fuzzy knowledge representation;fuzzy reasoning;graphical modeling advantage;intrusion detection;membrane computing;network security;neural-like computing model;tFRSN P system;trapezoidal fuzzy reasoning spiking neural P system","","0","","21","","","18-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaborative spectrum sensing among the cognitive radio nodes is expected to improve fidelity of primary user detection. However, malicious nodes can significantly impair the collaborative spectrum sensing by sending the wrong reports to the fusion center. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose non- regret learning algorithms to study the non-constructive secondary users caused either by evil-intention or altruistical incapability. Both perfect observation and partial monitoring are investigated, and two algorithms are proposed respectively. Some convergence properties are also shown. Moreover, we also analyze the case in which the nature is assumed to be a player.

Anomaly detection is an approach of intrusion detection that constructs models of normal behavior of users or systems and detects the behaviors that deviate from the model. Monitoring the sequences of system calls generated during the execution of privileged programs has been known to be an effective means of anomaly detection. In this paper, an approach for anolymal intrusion detection is presented and applied to monitor the abnormal behavior of processes. The approach is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of rules with the minimum size to form a normal behavior model from the record of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It may detect the abnormal operating status of a process. The normal behavior model in terms of the system call sequences is defined. And the detection algorithm is given for the application of rough set theory in intrusion detection. The illustrative example shows that it is feasible and effective.","","978-1-4244-5893-6","978-1-4244-5895-0","10.1109/EBISS.2010.5473675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473675","","Computer networks;Data mining;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Monitoring;Protection;Set theory;Statistics","rough set theory;security of data","anomaly detection;information security threats;intrusion detection approach;rough set theory;rules extraction;system call sequences","","2","","14","","","22-23 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tools are needed to analyse firewall configurations for errors, to verify that they correctly implement security requirements and to generate configurations from higher-level requirements. In this paper we extend our previous work on the use of formal argumentation and preference reasoning for firewall policy analysis and develop means to automatically generate firewall policies from higher-level requirements. This permits both analysis and generation to be done within the same framework, thus accommodating a wide variety of scenarios for authoring and maintaining firewall configurations. We validate our approach by applying it to both examples from the literature and real firewall configurations of moderate size (ap 150 rules).","","978-1-4244-3486-2","978-1-4244-3487-9","10.1109/INM.2009.5188808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5188808","","Communication system traffic control;Computer network management;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Error correction;Intrusion detection;Logic;Protection;Security;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;formal logic;software maintenance","corporate networks;firewall configuration management;firewall policy analysis;formal argumentation logic;preference reasoning;security protection","","3","","7","","","1-5 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework has several key features: (1) a secure mechanism for dispatching agents to selected nodes from secured agent repositories; (2) an operating environment for each agent that depends upon its role-based authenticated security level; (3) object-based, peer-to-peer and peer-to-many communication; (4) provision for encrypted communication; (5) a low-overhead distributed naming directory of agents populating the network; (6) proactive agent monitoring for secure operations; (7) tools for reflective monitoring of agent contents and communication; (8) a lightweight environment that is easy to use while keeping the agents small in size","","0-7803-5748-5","","10.1109/INM.1999.770718","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=770718","","Application software;Computer languages;Dispatching;Java;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Packaging;Peer to peer computing;Software agents","Java;authorisation;cryptography;monitoring;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management","Java-based software agents;agent communication;distributed naming directory;distributed software agents;encrypted communication;lightweight environment;network management;object-based communication;proactive agent monitoring;reflective monitoring;role-based authenticated security level;secure mechanism","","1","1","28","","","1999","24 May 1999-28 May 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
