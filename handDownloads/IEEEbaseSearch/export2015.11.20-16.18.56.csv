This paper intends to direct a novel clustering analysis by means of the affinity function that the adaptive polyclonal clustering strategy affects. The clustering algorithm has the advantage that it does not depend on priori knowledge and has nothing to do data distribution, effectively overcoming the disadvantage that some existing algorithms are sensitive to initialization and easy to be trapped into the local optima. This algorithm clusters large data sets with mixed numeric and categorical values effectively. The intrusion detection system based on this algorithm can deal with massive unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and anomaly and even can detect unknown attacks. The computer comparison-contrast simulations through the KDD CUP 99 datasets show that the algorithm discussed in this paper has much superior detection rate and less false positive rate when compared with AiNet algorithm, the algorithm of L.

But many of them are not sufficient and effective. Most intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or its efficiency, but it fails to address the security issues. Some of the nodes may be selfish, for example, by not forwarding the packets to the destination, thereby saving the battery power. Some others may act malicious by launching security attacks like denial of service or hack the information. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. This paper incorporates agents and data mining techniques to prevent anomaly intrusion in mobile adhoc networks. Innuendo, presenting an anomaly detection system comprises of detection modules for detecting anomalies in each layer. Home agents present in each system collects the data from its own system and using data mining techniques to observed the local anomalies. The Mobile agents monitoring the neighboring nodes and collect the information from neighboring home agents to determine the correlation among the observed anomalous patterns before it will send the data.

Around four hundred mobile viruses, worms, trojans and spy ware, together with approximately one thousand of their variants have been discovered to-date. So far no classification of such mobile P2P security threats exists. There is no well known simulation environment to model mobile P2P network characteristics and provide a platform for the analysis of the propagation of different types of mobile malware. Therefore, our research provides a classification of mobile malware based on the behaviour of a node during infection and develops a platform to analyse malware propagation. It proposes and evaluates a novel behaviour-based approach, using AI, for the detection of various malware families. Unlike existing approaches, our approach focuses on identifying and classifying malware families rather than detecting individual malware and their variants. Adaptive detection of currently known and previously unknown mobile malware on designated mobile nodes through a deployed detection framework aided by AI classifiers enables successful detection. Although we have classified around 30% of the existing mobile P2P malware into 13 distinct malware families based on their behaviour during infection, this paper focuses on two, Cabir & Commwarrior, in order to analyse the proposed detection framework.","","978-1-4577-1931-8","","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113305","MPeersim;Malware Classification;Malware Detection;Malware Families;Malware Propagation;Mobile Agents;Mobile P2P Networks","Analytical models;Batteries;Bluetooth;Grippers;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","computer network security;computer viruses;invasive software;mobile agents;mobile computing;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing","AI classifier;Cabir families;Commwarrior families;behaviour-based approach;malware family classification;mobile P2P malware detection framework;mobile malware classification;mobile network security;mobile node;mobile spyware;mobile trojan;mobile virus;mobile worm","","0","","18","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a kind of hardware based compact DFA structure for multiple regexes matching called CPDFA is presented. According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not. Simulation shows that CPDFA structure can save about 90% of memory storage comparing with the original DFA structure. By using pipelined architecture in FPGA, CPDFA can advance one character in one memory access cycle.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198833","","Application software;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Pattern matching;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security","DFA Structure;deterministic finite automata;indirect index;multiple regular expressions matching;parallel SRAMs;real-time deep packet inspection;regular expression matcher","","1","","13","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, it is easy to deploy and terminate large number of malicious virtual machines (VMs) in a few seconds while the administrator is probably difficult to identify these malicious VMs immediately. These features open doors for attackers to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that target at degrading the quality of cloud service. This paper studies an attack scenario that malicious tenants use cloud resources to launch DoS attack targeting at data center subnets. Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors. We conduct our experiments in the campus-wide data center, and the results show our detection system can promptly and accurately response to DoS attacks.","","978-1-4799-8086-4","","10.1109/CBD.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176094","Attack Detection;Cloud Data Center;DoS Attack;Information Entropy","","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security;data flow analysis;entropy;system monitoring;virtual machines","CPU usage;DoS attack;attack behavior;attack identification;campus-wide data center;cloud data center;cloud resources;cloud service quality degradation;data center subnets;data flow based detection;data flow pattern;entropy-based denial of service attack detection;information entropy;malicious VM;malicious tenants;malicious virtual machines;network resource isolation;network usage;virtual machine status monitoring","","0","","21","","","20-22 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is considered as the trusted computing base, and its integrity is extremely important for smooth functioning of the system. On the contrary, BIOS of new computer systems (servers, laptops, desktops, network devices, and other embedded systems) can be easily upgraded using a flash or capsule mechanism which can add new vulnerabilities either through malicious code, or by accidental incidents, and deliberate attack. The recent attack on Iranian Nuclear Power Plant (Stuxnet) [1:2] is an example of advanced persistent attack. This attack vector adds a new dimension into the information security (IS) spectrum, which needs to be guarded by implementing a holistic approach employed at enterprise level. Malicious BIOS upgrades can also cause denial of service, stealing of information or addition of new backdoors which can be exploited by attackers for causing business loss, passive eaves dropping or total destruction of system without knowledge of user. To address this challenge a capability for verification of BIOS integrity needs to be developed and due diligence must be observed for proactive resolution of the issue.

The optimization algorithm avoids the indefinite security problems in private key selection, and effectively prevents certificate forgery and coalition attack by dishonest users and other adversaries. And the optimization algorithm can also be applied to generate other secret parameters in advance. The algorithms of the scheme take great advantage of the superiority of ECC (elliptic curves cryptosystem), such as high efficiency, short key length and etc. The designing strategy not only reinforces the security, stability and robustness of key management scheme but also improves the application efficiency regarding software and hardware environment.","","978-0-7695-3859-4","","10.1109/IITA.2009.507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369405","adaptive optimization;bionic evolution;coalition attack;key management;system efficiency","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Design optimization;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Environmental management;Forgery;Hardware;Robust stability;Security","optimisation;private key cryptography;public key cryptography","adaptive optimization algorithm;bionic evolution;bionic optimization algorithm;certificate agency;certificate forgery;coalition attack;elliptic curves cryptosystem;indefinite security problems;key distribution center;key management scheme;private key selection;private keys","","0","","26","","","21-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 24th","20051227","2005","2","","10 pp. Vol. 2","","Air Traffic Service Providers (ATSPs) are embarking on a transition of their information systems to a new paradigm of System Wide Information Management (SWIM). SWIM defines an enterprise-wide open, flexible, modular, manageable and secure architecture that is transparent to users. Information sharing, including real-time capability, enables operational improvements and facilitates a reduction in the overall cost of operation and maintenance. SWIM enables decision support systems that connect many stakeholders including the ATSPs and the Airline Operations Centers. For the National Airspace System (NAS), SWIM also facilitates information sharing between with other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Due to the increased interconnection of ATSP systems and connections to outside enterprises and agencies, security requirements have expanded. New SWIM applications will be written using new technologies. Adapters will be developed to connect legacy applications. The new technologies introduced by SWIM allow a more standardized approach to security, while supporting existing security mechanisms in legacy applications. This paper proposes a security architecture for SWIM, including Identity and Access Management, Registry-Directory-Naming services security, Messaging security, Digital Rights Management and Security Information Management. It also describes the security requirements for the Common Data Transport (CDT) that underlies SWIM, including link and network security, firewalls and intrusion detection systems.","","0-7803-9307-4","","10.1109/DASC.2005.1563474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563474","","Costs;Data security;Decision support systems;Identity management systems;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Management information systems;National security;Terrorism","aerospace computing;air traffic control;authorisation;decision support systems;safety-critical software","Department of Homeland Security;National Airspace System;air traffic service provider;airline operations center;common data transport;decision support systems;digital rights management;firewalls;identity and access management;information sharing;intrusion detection systems;messaging security;network security;registry-directory-naming services security;security architecture;security information management;system wide information management","","0","","","","","30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the new prevention techniques for network threats is Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Feature selection is the major challenging issues in IDS in order to reduce the useless and redundant features among the attributes (e.g. attributes in KDD cup'99, an Intrusion Detection Data Set). In this paper, we aim to reduce feature vector space by calculating distance relation between features with Information Measure (IM) by evaluating the relation between feature and class to enhance the feature selection. Here we incorporate the Information Measure (IM) method with k-means Cluster Triangular Area Based Support Vector Machine (CTSVM) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to detect intrusion attacks.

As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node. The main challenge stems from difficulty involved in stating the occurrence of an attack based on second-hands evidences that may come from colluding attacker (s). To tackle this issue, we propose an entropy-based trust system that evaluates the trustworthiness of the nodes that provide the evidences.

We study how well q-gram distance approximates edit distance with special constraints needed in IDS applications. We compare the performances of the search procedure with the two distances applied in it.

The router with a network processor can be a solution for these requirements. IPsec provides a standard, robust and extensible mechanism in which to provide security to IP and upper-layer protocols. We can protect packets between hosts, between network security gateways (e.g., routers or firewalls), or between hosts and network security gateways using IPsec.

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination).

The HAN controller, which acts as a gateway, should not cause any delay by decrypting and re-encrypting the packets, nor should it has any chance to modify them. Considering the required level of security and quality of service, we design our protocol with an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) approach. We improve and implement the Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol in two steps. First, we propose an auxiliary mechanism that is an ECC version of PAKE, and then extend it to a multilayer consensus model. We reduce the number of hash functions to one, and utilize a primitive password shared between an appliance and HAN controller to construct four valid individual consensus and authenticated symmetric keys between the appliance and upstream controllers by exchanging only 12 packets. Security analysis presents that our protocol is resilient to various attacks.

Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems either focus on just one layer of observation or use a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. This paper describes a synergistic approach of fusing decisions of whether an attack takes place by using multiple measurements from different layers of wireless communication networks. The described method is implemented on a live system that monitors a wireless network in real time and gives an indication of whether a malicious frame exists or not. This is achieved by analysing specific metrics and comparing them against historical data. The proposed system assigns for each metric a belief of whether an attack takes place or not. The beliefs from different metrics are fused with the Dempster-Shafer technique with the ultimate goal of limiting false alarms by combining beliefs from various network layers. The on-line experimental results show that cross-layer techniques and data fusion perform more efficiently compared to conventional methods.","","978-1-4577-0455-0","","10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088478","Cross-layer measurements;Data fusion;Dempster-Shafer;Wi-Fi;Wireless attacks","Intrusion detection;Measurement;Monitoring;Real time systems;Web sites;Wireless networks","inference mechanisms;radiocommunication;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer technique;computer network;cross-layer technique;intrusion detection system;malicious frame;multilayer data fusion;online wireless attack detection system;synergistic approach;wireless communication network","","0","","11","","","10-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a covariance matrix based second-order statistical method to detect multiple known and unknown network anomalies. The detection method is initially based on the observations of the correlativity changes in typical flooding DoS attacks. It utilizes the difference of covariance matrices among observed samples in the detection. As case studies, extensive experiments are conducted to detect multiple DoS attacks - the prevalent Internet anomalies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rates in detecting multiple known and unknown anomalies.","","0-7803-9091-1","","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527505","Anomaly detection;DoS attacks;covariance matrix;second-order statistics","Application software;Computer crime;Computer network management;Covariance matrix;Detection algorithms;Floods;Internet;Intrusion detection;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;computer network management;covariance matrices;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet anomaly detection;covariance matrix;distributed computer networks;flooding DoS attacks;intrusion detection;network anomaly;network attacks;network prevention;network traffic management;second-order statistical detection;security defense","","0","","13","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since MFs are transmitted without encryption or authentication, attackers can easily launch various attacks by forging the MFs. In a collaborative environment with many Wi-Fi sniffers, such attacks can be easily detected by sensing the anomaly RSS changes. However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method. We observe about 8 times improvement by CSITE over RSS-based method on the falsely accepted attacking frames.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-5944-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567061","","Authentication;Cryptography;Decorrelation;IEEE 802.11n Standard;OFDM","telecommunication channels;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11n;CSI information;CSITE;PHY layer;RSS-based method;Txpower;Wi-Fi management frames;Wi-Fi sniffers;channel dynamics;channel state information;rapid spatial decorrelation;source authentication;user mobility","","1","","29","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although STP is widely used, it is still prone to many kinds of attacks that exploit the lack of security features both in basic working process and STP packet format. By exploiting STP control packet an attacker can pretend to be the new root in STP domain and perform unauthorized activities that lead to root take-over attack, STP control packet flooding, traffic redirection and so on. In this paper, a coverage based distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) has been introduced, for the detection of attacks on STP. The proposed scheme computes a set of switches in the network that can cover the STP network completely; where every switch belongs to that set is installed with a small module of IDS. This set of IDSs logically divides the STP network into a set of local zones. All the switches in a zone is directly connected to one switch installed with IDS and thus covered by at least one IDS in STP domain. Each IDS can detect and verify any exploit inside its local zone. Additionally IDSs communicate with each other so that any exploit outside the local zone of a particular IDS can also be detected and verified. The results show that the proposed DIDS approach can detect all the STP based attacks.","","978-1-4673-0127-5","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141374","","Bridges;Delay;Local area networks;Network topology;Probes;Protocols;Topology","computer network management;computer network security;protocols","DIDS;STP control packet flooding;STP packet format;computer network;coverage based distributed intrusion detection system;distributed IDS;exploit detection techniques;link layer protocol;link management;loop formation prevention;root take-over attack;security features;spanning tree protocol;traffic redirection","","1","","19","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main function of Intrusion Detection System is to protect the resources from threats. It analyzes and predicts the behaviours of users, and then these behaviours will be considered an attack or a normal behaviour. There are several techniques which exist at present to provide more security to the network, but most of these techniques are static. Test the proposed method by a benchmark intrusion dataset to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. Results show that choosing good attributes and samples will not only have impact on the performance, but also on the overall execution efficiency.

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we propose a distributed intrusion detection approach based on finish state machine (FSM).A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then we construct the finite state machine (FSM) by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify every nodes behaviour by the FSM, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, our approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness.","","0-7695-2263-7","","10.1109/SAINTW.2005.1619986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1619986","","Authentication;Automata;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","","","","5","","8","","","31-04 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Snort is a free and open source network intrusion detection and prevention tool which is basically a rule driven system. Hence rule development for such NIDS tools becomes a sensitive task. Clustering techniques had been widely used to cluster the network traffic and to derive rule sets based on the resultant clusters. We propose a parallel clustering technique followed by usage of evolutionary computing comprising of genetic algorithm and Hill climbing to optimize the clusters formed. Rules are generated by analyzing each individual clusters formed. The proposed system was specifically developed with a view to generate rule set for Snort based IDS efficiently. The results show that careful selection of fitness function could improve the efficiency of rule set generated. The computing power offered by grid is used to accomplish the parallel computing task.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing. Experimental results demonstrate the cases in which the performance of AACK is either improved or degraded when the number of MNs changes.","","978-1-4673-6617-5","","10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7149666","","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;security of data","AACK;IDS;MANETs;MNs;NS2;adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;mobile nodes","","0","","15","","","26-29 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The bio-inspired model platform is designed and implemented based on two sub-platforms. One is the ERS (Ecogent Runtime Services) platform that provides basic functions of a mobile agent including registration, life cycle, migration, communication, location and fault tolerance. The other is the bio platform that provides the capability of evolution and adaptability through genetic algorithm and stigmergy controls. Ecogent equipped with survivability and autonomy along with a simple platform structure modularized for flexibility and scalability facilitate development of various bio-inspired system model applications.

In the literature, several solutions have been developed to secure SCADA systems; however; the literature is lacking work directed at the development of tools to evaluate the effectiveness of such solutions. An essential requirement of such tools is the generation of normal and malicious SCADA traffic. In this paper, we present an automated tool to generate a malicious SCADA traffic to be used to evaluate such systems. We consider the traffic generation of the popular SCADA Modbus protocol. The characteristics of the generated traffic are derived from Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS) Modbus rules. The tool uses Scapy to generate packets based on the extracted traffic features. We present the testing results for our tool. The tool is used to read a Snort rule file that contains Modbus rules to extract the required traffic features.","","","","10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923938","Modbus;Network security;SCADA System;Scapy;Snort","Feature extraction;IP networks;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Receivers;SCADA systems","SCADA systems;computer network security;protocols","Modbus traffic generator;NIDS Modbus rules;SCADA Modbus protocol;SCADA systems security evaluation;Scapy;Snort network intrusion detection system;malicious SCADA traffic;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","0","","18","","","23-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS). An implementation of NFEA has been evaluated and the result shows that NFEA is viable to deploy in real networks.","","978-1-4577-0524-3","978-0-7695-4429-8","10.1109/ISPAW.2011.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952007","DDoS attacks;IP traceback;network forensic;network security;packet marking","Computer crime;Cryptography;Decoding;Encoding;Forensics;IP networks;Radio frequency","Internet;computer forensics;computer network security","AEMS;DDoS attack;Internet crimes;NFEA;TCP/IP based networks;authenticated evidence marking scheme;firewall;flow-based selection marking scheme;intrusion detection system;malicious packet modifications;network forensic evidence acquisition;packet marking","","0","","30","","","26-28 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the new viruses seen today aren't advancements in their own right; rather, they have just taken advantage of advancements in technology. And the sophistication of infection techniques and vectors used by viruses these days are on the rise. With a recent increase in network file-infecting viruses, it's high time we revisit the traditional techniques used to detect virus-like activity on the network and improve them.

In this work we propose a new architecture for IPPT (IP Packet Tracing) based on the traditional concept of keeping traffic logs stored in Bloom filters. The proposed architecture returns an attack graph that precisely identifies the route traversed by a given packet allowing the correct identification of the attacker. We show that previously published approaches may return misleading attack graphs in some particular situations, which may even avoid the determination of the real attacker. The proposed architecture has two other features that improve the efficiency of the returned attack graph: separate logs are kept for each router interface improving the distributed search procedure; an efficient dynamic log paging strategy is proposed.

Novel approaches related to this new communication paradigm have been proposed, mainly focusing on architectural aspects and categorization of potential applications. So far, security and privacy aspects related to the molecular communication systems have not been investigated at all and represent an open question that need to be addressed. The main motivation of this paper lies on providing some first insights about security and privacy aspects of MC systems, by highlighting the open issues and challenges and above all by outlining some specific directions of potential solutions.

MANET is an emerging research area with practical applications. However, wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics, such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability. Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. In general, routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is not trivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues of MANETs, and analyze in detail one type of attack-the ""black hole"" problem-that can easily be employed against the MANETs. We also propose a solution for the black hole problem for ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2002.1039859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039859","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Power system modeling;Routing protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless personal area networks;Wireless sensor networks","land mobile radio;radio networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;transport protocols","distributed cooperation;dynamic topology;home wireless personal area networks;mobile ad hoc network;on-demand distance vector routing protocol;open medium;routing security;satellite transmission;wireless MANET;wireless ad hoc networks;wireless mobile nodes","","173","3","10","","","Oct 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter. In this paper, a collaborative approach towards timely detection of such attacks through pattern reconstruction and verification is proposed. The scheme is capable of detecting anomalous readings within a consumer's household, with minimal communication and processing overhead imposed.","","978-1-4673-0894-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530492","","","Internet;power engineering computing;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Internet;anomalous readings;centralized servers;consumer devices;customer specific data;data aggregators;data concentrators;device implant attack detection;electricity grid;malicious attacks;pattern reconstruction;processing overhead;smart grid infrastructure;smart meters","","0","","15","","","3-5 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we discuss some of the emerging online threats that would likely target systems that facilitate sharing of electronic medical records. We design an enhanced version of the eHealth Exchange with mechanisms to prevent, detect and facilitate investigation of fraudulent medical claims resulting from successful breach of sensitive health data. We also support patient-awareness over how their data is consumed within the distributed network, and augment the accountability present within it. We implement our enhancements within CONNECT, which is an open-source implementation of the eHealth Exchange, and OpenMRS, which is a popular open source electronic medical record system platform.

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives. This paper analyses the various spoofing detection methods in WLANs bringing out their pros and cons including the different level of security provided ranging from low to high. The analysis in the paper also brings out as to which particular method could be more suitable in a particular scenario and how one can easily get the reduced false positives, which has been a bane of current detection methods. The paper also presents two case scenarios, particularly highlighting the victim Silent case scenario not discussed much thus far in the current literature on the topic, to validate the results. By way of retrospect, an outline of future work is also suggested in the concluding remarks.","","978-1-4799-1605-4","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2013.6719774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6719774","802.11 Wireless LAN;FRR;FRR-RA;MAC address;SNRA;Sequence Gap;Spoofing;false positives / negatives;transmission rate;victim Silent case in WLAN","Authentication;Computer crime;Monitoring;Probes;Protocols;Wireless LAN","access protocols;computer network security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN;MAC spoofing detection techniques;WLAN spoofing detection methods;cyber crimes;cyber criminal;denial of service;masquerading attacks;network identifiers;perpetrator-initiator;potent weapon;session hijacking;victim silent case","","0","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs, as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures).Many studies report that IDSs, including signature-based network IDSs, have problems to accurately identify attacks. One possible reason that we observed in our past work, and that is worth investigating further, is that several signatures (i.e., several alarms) can be triggered on the same group of packets, a situation we coined overlapping signatures. This paper presents a technique to precisely and systemat ically quantify the signature overlapping problem of an IDS signature database. The solution we describe is based on set theory and finite state automaton theory, and we experiment with our technique on one widely-used and maintained IDS. Results show that our approach is effective at systematically quantifying the overlap problem in one IDS signature database, and can be potentially used on other IDSs.","1530-0889","978-1-4244-9232-9","978-1-4244-9231-2","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958211","Automaton Theory;Intrusion Detection Signature;Set Theory","Automata;Databases;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Set theory;Systematics","authorisation;digital signatures;finite state machines;set theory","anti-virus systems;computer networks;finite state automaton theory;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;set theory;signature overlaps;signature-based network IDS","","2","","18","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ATMP has been implemented on top of TinyOS and has been tested using TOSSIM in several attack scenarios to evaluate the evolution of experience, trust and reputation.

While these attacks are very simple in implementation, their effect on WiFi networks can be devastating. To this end, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been employed to detect these attacks. In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network. Results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against the different versions of the attack compared to Snort-Wireless and can achieve a detection rate in average 100% and a false positive rate in average 0.1%","","1-4244-0700-1","","10.1109/CISDA.2007.368156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219103","","Computational intelligence;Data security;Detectors;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","digital signatures;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless LAN","GP-based IDS;WiFi networks;data link layer attacks;deauthentication attack;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;intrusion detector;snort-wireless","","0","","16","","","1-5 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, in addition to producing alerts, it should allow for easy insertion of new detection algorithms. It should also support dynamic selection and de-selection of detection algorithms, and it should adjust its resource consumption to the current need. Such a system would allow the operator to easily extend the system when new detection algorithms become available. It would also allow the operator to maintain a low-cost monitoring baseline and perform more extensive monitoring when it is required. In this paper we propose an architecture for intrusion detection which aims at providing the operator with this support. The architecture uses a modular design to promote a high degree of flexibility. This supports creation of an environment in which state-of-the-art intrusion detection algorithms easily can be inserted. The modular design also allows for detection algorithms to be enabled and disabled when required. Additionally, the architecture uses a sensor reconfiguration mechanism to affect the amount of data collected. When a detection algorithm is enabled or disabled, the sensor providing the input data to the algorithm is correspondingly reconfigured. This implies a minimum of excess collected data. To illustrate the feasibility of the architecture, we provide a proof - of-concept supporting monitoring of users for insider detection and webserver monitoring for intrusion attempts.","","978-0-7695-3324-7","","10.1109/IAS.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627079","adaption;intrusion detection;operator-centric;sensor reconfiguration;system architecture","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication system security;Computer science;Computer security;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Quality of service;Sensor systems","security of data","adaptive intrusion detection;insider detection;low-cost monitoring baseline;modular design;operator-centric intrusion detection;sensor reconfiguration mechanism;webserver monitoring","","0","","22","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, because the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of moving more processing power into storage, this paper presents a novel idea to design an IDS on object-based storage devices (OSD), and analyzes how the features of OSD can be used for intrusion detection (ID) and for violation responding. Moreover, the existing OSD standard is enhanced to own the new functions. Compared with the existing research on block-level storage devices, OSD-based ID is more straightforward for implementation. We build such a prototype based on the OSD reference implementation provided by Intel. Testing results show that the extra overhead introduced by ID is acceptable","1521-9097","0-7695-2612-8","","10.1109/ICPADS.2006.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655650","","Computerized monitoring;File systems;Information science;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protection;Prototypes;Storage area networks;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital storage;security of data","block-level storage devices;object-storage-based intrusion detection systems;violation response","","2","","20","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, a new self-learning strategy for selecting target addresses during malware propagation was introduced in [1], which we refer to as importance scanning. Under the importance-scanning approach, malware employs an address sampling scheme to search for the underlying group distribution of (vulnerable) hosts in the address space through which it propagates. The malware utilizes this information to increase the rate at which it locates viable addresses during its search for infection targets. In this paper, we introduce a strategy to combat importance scanning propagation.We propose the use of white hole networks, which combine several existing components to dissuade, slow, and ultimately halt the propagation of importance scanning malware. Based on analytical reasoning and simulations using real trace and address distribution information, we demonstrate how the white hole approach can provide an effective defense, even when the deployment of this countermeasure represents a very small fraction of the address space population.","","978-1-4244-0974-7","978-1-4244-0975-4","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550340","","Aggregates;Analytical models;Computer networks;Computer worms;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Routing;Sampling methods","","","","2","","38","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In RBAC(Role-based access control), users' role can be misused or abused through packet modulation by network intrusion and modulation on log-in information of users. Current RBAC system is preventing misuse or abuse of users by managing authority allotment included in role, but users' information that is abused through network modulation can be detected through efficient network monitoring and network traffic analysis. However, in the environment where EHR system is connected even to the Internet, much analysis time is needed to find abused and misused roles only by monitoring network traffic.

However, sophisticated attackers attempt to disable the IDS before they launch a thorough attack. Therefore, to accomplish its function, an IDS should have some mechanism to guarantee uninterrupted detection service even in the face of IDS component failures due to attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion-tolerant mechanism for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) that employ multiple independent components. The mechanism monitors the detection units and the hosts on which the units reside and enables the IDS to survive component failure due to intrusions. As soon as a failed IDS component is discovered, a copy of the component is installed to replace it and the detection service continues. We implement the intrusion-tolerant mechanism based on the CSI-KNN-based NIDS and evaluate the prototype in the face of component failures. The results demonstrate that the mechanism can effectively tolerate intrusions.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529353","Intrusion detection systems;Intrusion-tolerance","Availability;Computer crashes;Detectors;Face detection;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Prototypes;Telecommunication traffic","pattern classification;security of data","CSI-KNN;intrusion-tolerant mechanism;network intrusion detection systems;uninterrupted detection service","","2","","13","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
