The biological immune system can detect and defend the human body against different kinds of intruders. These systems are distributed, adaptive and multilayered in nature, and the proposed artificial immune system incorporates these powerful and diverse set of characteristics in designing a network security system. Recent advances in biological immune systems showed that the innate part of the system plays a greater role than previously thought. In this paper, this recent development is the corner stone of the new multi-layer model of artificial immune systems. We describe a work in progress to construct a multi-layered defense system composed of two main layers, innate and adaptive layers. This paper describes the multi-layered system layers and components, gives a detailed justification and design considerations of the system components, and shows first results from the innate layer of the system. The preliminary results show that about 70% of the traffic can be dealt with before entering the adaptive layer of the immune system.","","978-1-4673-6231-3","","10.1109/ICCEEE.2013.6633939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6633939","Artificial Immune Systems;Fuzzy Expert System;Innate Immune System;Intrusion Detection System;Network Security","Adaptive systems;Expert systems;Fuzzy logic;Immune system;Intrusion detection","artificial immune systems;computer network security","artificial immune system;computational intelligent systems;design considerations;human biological immune systems;multilayer network defense system;network security system","","0","","28","","","26-28 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hyper calls enable intrusions in hypervisors through their hyper call interfaces. Despite the importance, there is very limited publicly available information on vulnerabilities of hyper call handlers and attacks triggering them, which significantly hinders advances towards monitoring and securing these interfaces. In this paper, we characterize the hyper call attack surface based on analyzing a set of vulnerabilities of hyper call handlers.

This paper proposes a bio-inspired approach to describe the adaptive behavior of a particular service and the formation of composite components representing the constituent services. The paper depicts the policies to be used as rules by which adaptive behaviors can be specified prior to, or even during, execution. For a composite service, these policies are refined and applied to its constituent services, thus facilitating automatic refinement of high level policies to- lower level policies executable appropriate constituent service.

So far, these two problems have been studied separately.

We believe that polymorphic Internet worms will be developed in the future such that many of our current solutions might have a very small chance to survive. In this paper, we propose a simple solution called ""Buttercup"" to counter against attacks based on buffer-overflow exploits (such as CodeRed, Nimda, Slammer, and Blaster). We have implemented our idea in SNORT, and included 19 return address ranges of buffer-overflow exploits. With a suite of tests against 55 TCPdump traces, the false positive rate for our best algorithm is as low as 0.01%.

For this purpose, a variety of flow-based DDoS detection algorithms have been put forward. We have divided the flow-based DDoS attack detection techniques broadly into two categories namely, packet header based and mathematical formulation based. Analyses has been done for two techniques one belonging to each category. The paper has analyzed and evaluated these with respect to their detection accuracy and capability.

Traditional port-based technique has become much less effective since many new applications no longer use well-known port numbers. In this paper, we propose a novel profile-based approach to identify traffic flows belonging to the target application. In contrast to classifying traffic based on statistics of individual flows in previous studies, we build behavioral profiles of the target application, which describe dominant patterns of the application. Based on the behavioral profiles, a two-level matching is used in identifying new traffic. We first determine if a host participates in the application by comparing its behavior with the profiles. Subsequently, for each flow of the host we compare if it matches with the patterns in the profiles to determine which flows belong to this application. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on campus traffic traces. Our results show that one can identify the popular P2P applications with very high accuracy.","1548-615X","978-1-4244-2084-1","","10.1109/IWQOS.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4539687","","Access control;Application software;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;Data mining;Pattern matching;Payloads;Quality of service;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","P2P applications;network behavioral profiles;traffic flow;two-level matching","","3","2","19","","","2-4 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clonal selection strategy considering detector similarity is adopted to increase the diversity of detectors. With above two improvements, VRGA brings the self-adaptability of matching threshold in negative selection and reduces the dependence of matching threshold on experience.

In wireless networks the scenario is much different, there are no firewalls and gateways in place hence attacks can take place from any location within radio coverage area. Each mobile node in ad-hoc network is an autonomous unit in itself free to move independently. This means a node with not adequate physical protection is very much susceptible to be compromised.

A security solution is proposed based on the role-based access control (RBAC) model. Within an RBAC security model, roles are identified for different job assignments. Users are assigned roles according to their job functions. Required permissions are associated with each role. An example illustrates the coordination between the RBAC model and security sensors for cluster computing.

A unit-circle is then constructed using two selected features.

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes. Weights and thresholds are used for separating suspicious behaviours from normal ones","","0-7803-9545-X","","10.1109/AERO.2006.1655944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655944","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Paper technology","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","adaptive sinkhole detection;denial-of-services;intrusion detection;security features;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","21","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We improve such backtracking techniques by logging certain additional parameters of the file system during normal operations (real-time) and examining the logged information during the analysis phase. In addition, we use dataflow analysis within the processes related to the intrusion to prune unwanted paths from the dependency graph.

However, how to substantiate these two generic groups of alerts without incurring additional overheads are classical research issues. Therefore, we present clustering-based adaptive P-filter model to investigate false positives.

There are three merits of this novel model. First, danger theory provides a method of 'grounding' the immune response to reduce false alarms. Second, each layer of the model can work independently and interact with each other, so the efficiency of detecting is greatly improved.

In the same motif, organizations are establishing security and survivability frameworks as an integral part of their business strategy so as to provide an acceptable quality-of-service for their clients and employees. However, the current paradigm of outsourced managed security service providers (MSSPs) is often difficult to transition to, offers little control to the organization, does not allow ldquobest of breedrdquo composition, and risks vendor lock-in due to the complexity of migrating to a different MSSP. We present MOSES (Mediated Overlay Services), an architecture for composing network security services such as anti-spam, antivirus, automated vulnerability detection and mitigation, and filtering. MOSES is roughly modeled on the web services framework. In addition to ease-of-deployment, MOSES allows for economies of scale and a reduction to the total cost of ownership. In this paper, we discuss our motivation and high-level view of such an architecture. We highlight the advantages, illuminate potential drawbacks, and discuss a broad research agenda toward realizing this vision.","","978-1-4244-2483-2","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567338","","Application software;Availability;Costs;Data security;Economies of scale;Filtering;Management training;Outsourcing;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","Web services;information networks;security of data","Web services framework;antispam;antivirus;automated vulnerability detection;managed security service providers;mediated overlay services;network security;quality-of-service;total cost of ownership","","0","","19","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prior works on traffic classification mainly focus their attentions on dividing Internet traffic into different categories based on application layer protocols (such as HTTP, Bit Torrent etc.). Making traffic classification from another point of view, we divide Internet traffic into different content types. Our technology is an attempt to solve the classification problem of network traffic, which contains unknown and proprietary protocols (i.e., no publicly available protocol specification). In this paper, we design a classifier which can distinguish Internet traffic into different content types using machine learning techniques. Features of our classifier are entropy of consecutive bytes and frequencies of characters. Our method is capable of classifying real-world traces into different content types (including Text, Picture, Audio, Video, Compressed, Base 64-encoded image, Base 64-encoded text and Encrypted). The chief features of our classifier are small computing space (about 1K Bytes) and high classification accuracy (about 81%).","","978-1-4577-1172-5","978-0-7695-4509-7","10.1109/NAS.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005446","entropy vector;file content;machine learning;traffic classification","Accuracy;Cryptography;Entropy;Internet;Machine learning;Payloads;Protocols","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","64-encoded image;Audio;Bit Torrent;HTTP;ISP;Internet service providers;Internet traffic;Picture;QoS;Text;Video;machine learning techniques;network community;traffic classification","","2","","27","","","28-30 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the distributed system framework, we can analyze a whole data set of KDD'99 by first applying our preprocessing. In addition, we use an anomaly detection model for log analysis. A key challenge is to make anomaly detection work more accurately. For the Kmeans algorithm, a key challenge is to set the appropriate number of the initial cluster (K). Moreover, we discuss whether the number of entries in log files affects the accuracy and detection rate of the system or not.

Neural network, statistical models, rule learning, and ensemble methods are some of the kinds of machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model. The proposed ensemble method provides competitively low false positives compared with other machine learning techniques.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155853","Bagging;Ensemble;False positives;Machine learning;REPTree;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Bagging;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","NSL-KDD dataset;REPTree;classification accuracy;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;neural network;physical computer networks;statistical models;using bagging ensemble method;virtual computer networks","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We addresses the core competencies required to be a security conscious network manager and give some examples of things that improves our organization's current security profile. Our opinion is that an administrator cannot secure what he doesn't understand. The reality of this is that without a deep understanding of core areas of computing we have no chance of defending a network. Computer and network attacks are the product of an attacker's understanding of the strengths and weaknesses in operating systems, features of popular software, networking protocols, and programming languages. These four areas of computing are referred to as the core competencies of computing. An attacker with this skill set will be able to use his understanding of these fundamentals to turn common computing tasks or common misconfigurations against us(that is hacking). Network managers are often unwilling to implement measures that could improve their security for the following reasons: 1) they think it's too expensive. 2) they think it'd be too much work, and not enough benefits. 3) they don't think they 'll ever be attacked. 4) they don't know common security measures and recommended practices. Some things we should consider implementing to improve our security are: 1) firewall 2) anti-virus software 3) vulnerability scanners 4) centralized logging 5) intrusion detection system 6) virtual private networking technology.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232393","","Computer hacking;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Software measurement;Software packages;Technology management;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer crime;computer network management;telecommunication security;virtual private networks","anti-virus software;centralized logging;computer network attackers;core competency;firewall;intrusion detection system;network manager;networking protocol;operating system;programming language;security profile;virtual private networking technology;vulnerability scanner","","1","","4","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper traces the development of an information assurance (IA) architecture for Army installations. Early in 1999, as a critical initiative within the Army's Installation Information Infrastructure Architecture (I3A) project, the Army's ODISC4 Architectures Directorate undertook the task of developing an IA architecture overlay that could be applied to Army installation communications and computer network backbones. Following DoD's Defense-In-Depth philosophy and taking into account current and emerging DoD and Army IA policies, a multiorganizational team continues to develop a flexible, capabilities-based IA architecture that blends Army IA concepts with accepted best practices from the commercial world. The emerging architecture is being applied to both ATM and TCP/IP networks and is enabling the Army to tailor installation IA implementations to meet unique mission requirements. The paper describes and discusses the various policies, capabilities, techniques, and types of produces that are currently included in the architecture including firewalls, security enabled routers, and proxy servers. Some of the challenges that are facing Army networks such as electronic commerce and issues associated with malicious code are presented along with potential solutions that are currently being investigated including the use of technologies like e-mail scanning servers and virtual private networks. Key efforts and initiatives undertaken by the 13A Configuration Control Board's Information Assurance Working Group to develop the concepts, policies, and management processes that the Army will need to maintain its IA enabled networks are also included","","0-7803-6521-6","","10.1109/MILCOM.2000.904992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904992","","Best practices;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Electronic commerce;IP networks;Information systems;Network servers;Protection;Spine;TCPIP","Internet;asynchronous transfer mode;computer network management;electronic commerce;information networks;military communication;military computing;network servers;packet switching;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ATM networks;DoD;Installation Information Infrastructure Architecture;Internet;ODISC4 Architectures Directorate;TCP/IP networks;US Army;army installations;computer networks protection;e-mail scanning servers;electronic commerce;firewalls;information assurance architecture;information systems protection;malicious code;network attacks;network disruption;network management;network security;proxy servers;security enabled routers;virtual private networks","","0","","","","","2000","22 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this, traffic from an identified attacker is redirected to an alternative server where damage can be mitigated. The advantage of this system is that it blocks intrusions in a manner transparent to the attacker and allows for observation and investigation of attacks in order to enable the administrator to take appropriate action.

Packet classification systems have traditionally been built utilizing Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) due to the high throughput needed. However, TCAMs are expensive in terms of area and power consumption. An alternative to TCAM based systems using SRAM and a novel rule encoding method has been proposed to match multiple packets simultaneously (using multiple store_compare_units). This alternative achieves similar or better throughput than the traditional TCAM approach while occupying smaller space and consuming less energy. This paper revamps the existing SRAM-based architecture to reduce area and power consumption without threatening throughput. Two methods are shown. The first method allows for range encoding SRAMs to be shared between store_compare_units (SCUs) to lower area and power consumption with minor effect on throughput. The second method discusses a hybrid system allowing rules with prefixes (single rules) and ranges (rules which match a range of addresses, usually translated to many prefixes) to exist in parallel for the same domain. This allows for lower power consumption than utilizing fixed range encoding due to optimization of the ruleset. Results show that this hybrid architecture saves more than 20% of power/field if half of the TCP ports contain ranges (and the other half contains prefixes). The new extensions have been tested in over ten benchmarks (including the SNORT ruleset) to verify the claimed improvements.","","978-1-4244-7628-2","","10.1109/NCA.2010.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598235","LOP;Packet Classification;Range Encoding","Australia;Clocks;Encoding;Memory management;Power demand;Random access memory;Throughput","SRAM chips;computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching","SNORT ruleset;SRAM;TCP ports;packet classification system;range encoding;rule encoding;store compare units;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","24","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to certain issues like open structure and limited energy supply, the nodes sometimes misbehave and act in a selfish manner. 2ACK scheme used as an add-on technique on few routing protocols (e.g. DSR) to detect such misbehaviour for mitigating their adverse effect. The major limitation of this 2ACK scheme is additional routing overhead due to authenticated 2ACK packets.

A number of computerized systems-including ATM networks, web servers, and intrusion detection systems-systematically track every atomic action we perform, thus generating massive streams of timestamped observation data, possibly from multiple concurrent activities. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently detecting occurrences of high-level activities from such interleaved data streams. A solution to this important problem would greatly benefit a broad range of applications, including fraud detection, video surveillance, and cyber security. There has been extensive work in the last few years on modeling activities using probabilistic models. In this paper, we propose a temporal probabilistic graph so that the elapsed time between observations also plays a role in defining whether a sequence of observations constitutes an activity. We first propose a data structure called “temporal multiactivity graph” to store multiple activities that need to be concurrently monitored. We then define an index called Temporal Multiactivity Graph Index Creation (tMAGIC) that, based on this data structure, examines and links observations as they occur. We define algorithms for insertion and bulk insertion into the tMAGIC index and show that this can be efficiently accomplished. We also define algorithms to solve two problems: the “evidence” problem that tries to find all occurrences of an activity (with probability over a threshold) within a given sequence of observations, and the “identification” problem that tries to find the activity that best matches a sequence of observations. We introduce complexity reducing restrictions and pruning strategies to make the problem-which is intrinsically exponential-linear to the number of observations. Our experiments confirm that tMAGI- has time and space complexity linear to the size of the input, and can efficiently retrieve instances of the monitored activities.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2011.246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095553","Activity detection;indexing;stochastic automata;timestamped data","Automata;Context awareness;Hidden Markov models;Indexing;Monitoring;Stochastic processes","computational complexity;computerised monitoring;data structures;graph theory;probabilistic automata;probability;stochastic automata","concurrent activity monitoring;data structure;evidence problem;high-level activity occurrence detection;identification problem;interleaved data streams;intrinsically exponential problem;space complexity;tMAGIC index;tMAGIC insertion algorithm;temporal multiactivity graph index creation;temporal multiactivity probabilistic graph;temporal stochastic automaton-based activity model indexing;time complexity;timestamped observation data streams","","3","","16","","2011-12-06","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time. Morpheus uses templates to speed up dynamic automaton reconfiguration. Results from empirical studies confirm the benefits of our approach, with three orders of magnitude improvement achieved in the overall pattern matching performance with the help of dynamic reconfiguration. This is accomplished only with a modest increase in amortized memory usage.","1063-6382","978-1-4673-0042-1","","10.1109/ICDE.2012.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228144","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Dynamic scheduling;Engines;Equations;Optimization;Pattern matching","data structures;deterministic automata;pattern matching;query processing","autoreconfigurable automaton;data stream;database searching;deterministic automata;dynamic automaton reconfiguration;dynamic configuration morphing;massive pattern query optimization;nondeterministic automata;pattern matching;query pattern representation;resource constrained system;static pattern representation","","1","","29","","","1-5 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A main program, being a typical intrusion detection system residing at a server, creates mobile agents called Aglets and dispatches them to the remote hosts of the network. The agents trace and detect the network traffic and look for abnormal activities by matching against a limited set of signature patterns supplied by the main machine. The agents are programmed with enough intelligence to decide whether to send the logged data (captured packets) to the main machine for further analysis. The proposed model comprises two major components: the Intrusion Detection Component with the Mobile Agent Platform, and distributed intelligent mobile agents.

One problem with current implementations, however, is the sheer number of alerts they can generate, many of which tend to be false alarms. This drawback makes effective use of such systems a challenging task. In this paper we explore three-dimensional approaches to visualizing network intrusion detection system alerts and aggregated network statistics in order to provide the system administrator with a better picture of the events occurring on his or her network. While some research has been done using two-dimensional concepts, 3D approaches have not received much attention with regard to detecting network intrusions. Evaluation of our visualizations using the 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set demonstrates the potential benefit of utilizing the third dimension. We show how a number of attack types in the data set generate visual evidence of abnormal activity that a security administrator might use as motivation for further investigation.","","0-7803-9477-1","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532073","","Computer interfaces;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Data visualization;Graphical user interfaces;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection","data visualisation;security of data","1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set;abnormal network activity;aggregated network statistics;data reduction;network intrusion detection system;three-dimensional visualization;visual evidence generation","","3","6","13","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeypots help to explore new vulnerabilities in an organization and defining the security policy of an organization. A honeypot is used in the area of computer and Internet security. It is a resource, which is intended to be attacked or compromised to gain more information about the attacker and his attack techniques. It can also be used to attract and divert an attacker from the real targets. This paper focuses on the possibilities of honeypots and their use in an educational as well as productive environment.

At first, we analyze the privacy level users require and quantify security degree and performance of encryption algorithms. Then, an appropriate security composition is derived by the results of analysis and quantified data.

Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected.

The international research shows that network security is on the way to trustworthy network. Apart from current security mechanism, the future trustworthy network adds network behaviour trust and user behaviour trust, so user behaviour prediction is important and significant for realization of the trustworthy network.

"An integrated testbed for advanced wireless networked control systems technology","Taylor, J.H.; Slipp, J.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Univ. of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada","IECON 2010 - 36th Annual Conference on IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","20101223","2010","","","2101","2106","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have gained widespread acceptance during the last decade, largely due to the greatly increased flexibility, lower costs and scalability that they have been shown to provide. The pace of application in the context of wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) has been somewhat impeded, however, by the reluctance of industry to accept the risks of allowing wireless paths to be incorporated in process control loops. The problem is that there are conflicts between maintaining control loop performance, which can be degraded by many factors, such as low data rates, delays in wireless paths, jitter and electromagnetic interference; and the usual objectives in managing a wireless sensor network, namely freedom to configure the network and to adjust data rates at will, to maximize efficiency and to conserve energy consumption in battery-powered network nodes. In the context of developing advanced controls technology for systems with wireless networks in feedback paths there is a strong need for a test environment that can be used to explore all facets of such systems, including potential problems relating to control loop performance and WSN management. We propose to address this requirement by developing a new testbed for research in WNCSs by adding advanced control agents and process simulators from the Intelligent Control and Asset Management or ICAM project to an existing WSN testbed called the Wireless Industrial Sensor Network Testbed for Radio-Harsh Environments or WINTeR. This testbed has been custom developed for oil and gas industrial environments, i.e., it includes features such as electromagnetic interference and complex multipath propagation. The proposed new testbed, hereafter called WINTeR-ICAM, will include the ICAM Supervisor, ICAM Agents and an additional agent to resolve conflicts between maintaining control loop performance and managing the WSN effectively and efficiently, called a WNCS Coordination Agent or WNCSCA. This age- - nt is designed to be part of an intelligent supervisory control system, and to grant the WSN as much latitude in meeting its objectives as possible while maintaining the performance of control loops that incorporate wireless paths, thus adding to the safety and reliability of future WNCSs. Together, the process simulators, ICAM Agents and WINTeR will provide a powerful new environment for research and development of advanced WNCS technology, with WSN hardware and software in the loop; this novel conception is the contribution of this paper.","1553-572X","978-1-4244-5225-5","978-1-4244-5226-2","10.1109/IECON.2010.5675268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5675268","","Actuators;Communication system security;Data models;Delay;Process control;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","networked control systems;telecommunication control;wireless sensor networks","WNCS coordination agent;advanced wireless networked control systems;battery-powered network nodes;data rate factor;electromagnetic interference factor;jitter factor;radio-harsh environments;wireless industrial sensor network testbed;wireless paths delay factor;wireless sensor networks","","3","","25","","","7-10 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns. This paper analyses the role of computational intelligence techniques to design adaptive and cognitive intrusion detection systems that can efficiently detect malicious network activities and proposes novel three-tier archite- ture for designing intelligent intrusion detection systems for wireless networks.","","978-1-4799-1594-1","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724156","IP address;MAC address;Pervasive computing;adaptation;attacks;computational intelligence;intrusion detection;wireless integration","Communication system security;Computational intelligence;IP networks;Internet;Security;Wireless networks","artificial intelligence;computer network security;radiocommunication;ubiquitous computing","3G based Internet communication;Amazon;Internet of Things;banks;business transactions;computational intelligence based intrusion detection systems;computing paradigm;cyber-physical computing;cybercrime;data confidentiality;eBay;malicious intrusions;malware;pervasive computing networks;shopping firms;sophisticated attacks;stock exchanges;wireless communication capability;wireless communication networks","","1","","14","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, an adaptive intrusion detection engine (AIDE) is applied to automatically renew the detected order of rules according to the performance metric. The KDD CUPpsila99 DATA is used for evaluation and results show that the rules, which are extracted by the CGREA algorithm within a few evolution generations, can not only achieve high detection rate but also detect unknown attacks.

MANETs commonly demand a robust, diverse, energy-efficient, and resilient communication and computing infrastructure, enabling network-centric operation with minimal downtime. MANETs face security risks and energy consumption. However, conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a MANET becomes a challenging issue because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address this issue, we develop both lossless and lossy aggregation techniques to reduce the energy cost in information transition and bandwidth consumption while preserving the desired detection accuracy. In particular, we develop two lossless aggregation techniques: compression-based and event-based aggregation and develop a lossy aggregation technique: feature-based aggregation. We conduct real-world experiments and simulation study to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed data aggregation techniques in terms of the energy consumption and detection accuracy.","","978-1-4673-3131-9","","10.1109/CCNC.2013.6488430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488430","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring","data compression;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","MANET;bandwidth consumption;compression-based aggregation;computing infrastructure;cyber attack monitoring;data aggregation techniques;energy consumption;energy cost;energy-efficiency;event-based aggregation;feature-based aggregation;host-based intrusion detection;lossless aggregation techniques;lossy aggregation techniques;mobile ad hoc networks;network-centric operation;security risks","","1","","11","","","11-14 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes in MANETs use radio signals with a finite range to communicate making it possible for any intermediate node to intercept the communication. Also the frequently changing topology, with high susceptibility to physical compromise along with the node's limitations in terms of energy resource, storage device and CPU form a tremendous challenge in providing security to MANETs. Unlike wired networks, there is no central infrastructure, which paves way for new challenges as services provided by central entities is now to be ensured by the mobile nodes in the network itself. As a result, there is no definitive form of defense and a comprehensive security solution should encompass avoidance, detection and reaction along with sought-after network performances. This paper focuses on the prevention/proactive approach of securing MANETs using NTRU (N<sup>th</sup> degree truncated polynomial ring), to secure end-to-end communication through data encryption during data transmission. NTRU is Lattice-based cryptography, which is known to be resistant to quantum attacks. We assume a clustered MANET environment i.e. the mobile nodes have an efficient cluster-based routing algorithm deployed which gives us the list of clusters available in the environment along with its cluster heads and competent routing between them. The proposed technique provides data encryption using NTRU between cluster heads.","","978-1-4799-3974-9","","10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238393","Lattice-based cryptography;Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) security;NTRU cryptosystem;efficient cluster-based routing;secure data transmission;secure message transmission","Ad hoc networks;Data communication;Encryption;Mobile computing;Polynomials","cryptography;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET topology;NTRU;Nth degree truncated polynomial ring;cluster-based routing algorithm;data encryption;lattice based secure data transmission;lattice-based cryptography;mobile ad hoc network node;radio signals;wireless communication adapter","","0","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions. In a real implementation/evaluation of our cooperative intrusion detection system, we demonstrate that it achieves a higher detection rate (93%) than state of art solutions (60%-73%).","1095-2055","978-1-4577-0637-0","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006035","","Biological cells;Delay;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optimization;Power demand","cooperative communication;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless sensor networks","cooperative IDS;cooperative intrusion detection functions;optimal monitoring;resource constrained wireless networks","","0","","15","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At early stages, the researchers were more focused on the securing the WSNs without considering the optimization factor. As a result, such architectures involved heavy computation which slowed down the process and also faced hardware limitations. The focus of the current generation research work on WSN is providing “secure and optimal” solution. This has proved to be very challenging, but the efforts have been continuously going on in this area due to which this industry is booming.

The behaviors of business applications on cloud are constantly evolving due to technical upgrading, cloud migration as well as social outbreaks. These changes bring the challenge of detecting anomalies during the change of applications on cloud. LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm has already been proven as the most promising outlier detection method for detecting network intrusions. To improve the performance of detection, LOF needs a complete set of normal behaviors of business applications, which is usually not available in cloud computing. We present an adaptive anomaly detection scheme for cloud computing based on LOF. Our scheme learns behaviors of applications both in training and detecting phase. It is adaptive to the change during detecting. The adaptability of our scheme reduces demand of efforts on collecting training data before detecting. It also enables the ability to detect contextual anomalies. Experimental results show that our scheme can effectively detect contextual anomalies with relatively low computational overhead.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605790","Cloud Computing;LOF;adaptive;anomaly detection;contextual anomaly","Business;Cloud computing;Clustering algorithms;Knowledge based systems;Testing;Training;Web servers","cloud computing;commerce;information technology;outsourcing;security of data","IT;LOF-based adaptive anomaly detection scheme;business applications;cloud computing;local outlier factor;network intrusion detection;outsourcing;social outbreaks","","1","","20","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the rapid increase of link speeds and throughputs - especially in larger networks such as backbone networks - seriously constrains this approach. First, devices capable of detecting intrusions on high-speed links of 10 Gbps and higher are rather expensive, or must be built based on complex arrays. Second, legislation commonly restricts the way in which backbone network operators can analyse the data in their networks. To overcome these constraints, flow-based intrusion detection can be applied, which traditionally focuses only on packet header fields and packet characteristics. Flow export technologies are nowadays embedded in most high-end packet forwarding devices and are widely used for network management, which makes this approach economically attractive.","2325-5366","978-9949-9544-0-7","","10.1109/CYCON.2014.6916403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916403","Flow-Based Intrusion Detection;High-speed Networks;Intrusion Detection;Legal Inspection;Network Security","High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Standards;Taxonomy","computer network management;computer network security","DPI;backbone networks;deep packet inspection;flow-based intrusion detection;high-speed networks;network management;packet forwarding devices","","0","","30","","","3-6 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
