In the scheme, the private key for e-cash generating and identity tracing is generated with evolutionary algorithm by a successive optimizing process. The adaptive optimizing of secret parameters with bionic evolution avoids the randomness and indefinite security problem in private key selection, and thus prevents generalized e-cash forgery and coalition attack by dishonest users and other outer adversaries. The optimizing algorithm can also be applied to other essential parameters, such as the private keys of TTP (Trustable Third Party) and e-cash users to further improve the security of e-cash. Besides, the optimizing algorithm can be executed in advance without any influence to the efficiency of e-cash scheme. This designing strategy not only reinforces the security and stability of e-cash scheme but also greatly improves the efficiency of software and hardware application.","","978-0-7695-3859-4","","10.1109/IITA.2009.512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369402","adaptive optimization;bionic evolution;electronic cash;secret parameters;system efficiency","Artificial intelligence;Business;Elliptic curve cryptography;Evolution (biology);Evolutionary computation;Forgery;Genetic programming;Intelligent systems;Security;Stability","electronic money;evolutionary computation;private key cryptography","bionic evolution;e-cash forgery;electronic cash scheme;evolutionary algorithm;private key","","0","","17","","","21-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","978-1-4673-2708-4","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research, we present an entropy-based network traffic profiling scheme for detecting security attacks. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. The purpose of the first stage is to systematically construct the probability distribution of relative uncertainty for normal network traffic behavior. In the second stage, we use the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, a calculation that measures the level of difference of two probability distributions, to detect abnormal network activities. The probability distribution of the relative uncertainty for short-term network behavior is compared with that of the long-term profile constructed in the first stage. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme for DoS attacks with the dataset derived from KDD CUP 1999.

After that two intrusion detection techniques for mobile ad-hoc networks, which use collaborative efforts of nodes in a neighborhood to detect a malicious node in that neighborhood are explained. The first technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes in which each pair of nodes in the neighborhood is within radio range of each other. The second technique is designed for detection of malicious nodes in a neighborhood of nodes, in which each pair of nodes may not be in radio range of each other but where there is a node among them which has all the other nodes in its one-hop vicinity. Both techniques use message passing between the nodes. A node called the monitor node initiates the detection process. Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each node determines the nodes it suspects to be malicious and send votes to the monitor node. The monitor node upon inspecting the votes determines the malicious nodes from among the suspected nodes. Defect of these techniques is the impossibility of detecting wormhole attack in the form of out of band attack so in this paper we complete these techniques to give the ability of detecting wormhole attack and isolating them from routing process.","","978-1-61284-295-0","","10.1109/ICRIIS.2011.6125695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125695","Cluster;Monitor node;Wormhole attack;clique;insert Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET)","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Relays;Routing;Routing protocols","message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;collaborative techniques;intrusion detection;malicious node detection;message passing;mobile ad hoc networks;one-hop vicinity;radio range;routing process;suspected nodes;wormhole attack detection","","1","","20","","","23-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Hybrid Intrusion Detection with Weighted Signature Generation over Anomalous Internet Episodes","Kai Hwang; Min Cai; Ying Chen; Min Qin","Viterbi Sch. of Eng., Southern California Univ., Los Angeles, CA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on","20070212","2007","4","1","41","55","This paper reports the design principles and evaluation results of a new experimental hybrid intrusion detection system (HIDS). This hybrid system combines the advantages of low false-positive rate of signature-based intrusion detection system (IDS) and the ability of anomaly detection system (ADS) to detect novel unknown attacks. By mining anomalous traffic episodes from Internet connections, we build an ADS that detects anomalies beyond the capabilities of signature-based SNORT or Bro systems. A weighted signature generation scheme is developed to integrate ADS with SNORT by extracting signatures from anomalies detected. HIDS extracts signatures from the output of ADS and adds them into the SNORT signature database for fast and accurate intrusion detection. By testing our HIDS scheme over real-life Internet trace data mixed with 10 days of Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) attack data set, our experimental results show a 60 percent detection rate of the HIDS, compared with 30 percent and 22 percent in using the SNORT and Bro systems, respectively. This sharp increase in detection rate is obtained with less than 3 percent false alarms. The signatures generated by ADS upgrade the SNORT performance by 33 percent. The HIDS approach proves the vitality of detecting intrusions and anomalies, simultaneously, by automated data mining and signature generation over Internet connection episodes","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2007.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4099191","Internet episodes;Network security;SNORT and Bro systems;anomaly detection;false alarms;intrusion detection systems;signature generation;traffic data mining.","Computer networks;Data mining;Databases;Hybrid power systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Security;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;digital signatures;security of data;telecommunication security","Internet connection episode;Internet trace data;anomalous traffic episode mining;anomaly detection system;automated data mining;hybrid intrusion detection system;signature database;signature extraction;signature-based intrusion detection system;weighted signature generation","","18","1","34","","","Jan.-March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Vulnerability assessment through mobile agents","Mallah, G.A.; Shaikh, Z.A.","","E-Tech 2004","20041115","2004","","","92","96","Vulnerability assessment is the process of measuring and prioritizing the risks associated with network- and host based systems to allow balance planning of technologies and activities that manage business risk. That is useful for adapting security policy, analysis of vulnerabilities, and creation of reports that effectively communicate security vulnerability discoveries and detailed corrective actions to all levels of an organization. While vulnerability assessment is not a new technology, mobile agents offer many advantages to the traditional implementations. The most significant contribution is the increased ability for system administrators to quickly and easily add distributed components to existing systems that can look for newly published vulnerabilities. This paper suggests the vulnerability assessment through mobile agents where both network and host-based technologies in coordinated fashion using mobile agents will provide the best vulnerability assessment for measuring an organization's security risks. The mobile agent targets the intended host or network, captures, analyzes, and scans all vulnerabilities and reports to the master agent/server for comprehensive analysis and security assessment, and the master agent will act accordingly. The paper also addresses advantages and issues regarding its implementation.","","0-7803-8655-8","","10.1109/ETECH.2004.1353850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353850","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Process planning;Risk management;Technology planning;Telecommunication traffic","computer network reliability;mobile agents;risk analysis;security of data;telecommunication security","balance planning;business risk;corrective actions;distributed system components;host based systems;master agent;mobile agents;network- based systems;risk assessment;security risks;security vulnerability discoveries;system administrators;vulnerability assessment;vulnerability capture","","2","2","10","","","31 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software vulnerability may jeopardize information confidentiality and cause software failure leading tocatastrophic threats to humans or severe economic losses. Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats. This paper is divided into two parts.

These networks can be formed, merged or partitioned into separate networks on the fly, without necessarily relying on a fixed infrastructure to manage the operation. Two important properties of an ad-hoc network are that it is self-organized and adaptive. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) where security is a crucial issue, trust plays an important factor that could improve the number of successful data transmission process. The higher the numbers of nodes that trust each other in the network means the higher successful communication process rates could be expected. Since there is no central controller to determine the reliable & Secure communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. In this paper, we provide a model & evidence through experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET Intrusion Detection System (IDS).","","978-1-4244-9033-2","","10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640420","","Engines;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","MANET;data transmission;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;reliable communication paths;secure communication paths","","3","","18","","","17-19 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors.

When the intrusion is detected, the data services need to be discontinued immediately to retain the security and the integrity of the valuable data, till the system is recovered from the threat. By discontinuing data services, the end users may face inconveniences in using the system because of its temporary unavailability. Data hibernation addresses a mechanism of secure transferring of data and providing an access of the data alternatively keeping the data integrity intact. Data hibernation involves three steps i.e. designing an alternate schema for storing data, transferring data to that alternate storage and providing an access to that data.

We investigate and compare the performance of IDSs using SVMs and ANNs, using a well-known set of intrusion evaluation data gathered by DARPA. Through a variety of comparative experiments, it is found that, with appropriately chosen kernel functions, SVMs outperform ANNs in at least three critical aspects of IDS performance: (1) Accuracy - SVMs achieve very-high accuracy (in the high 90% range) than the best-trained ANNs, (2) Training Time and Testing Time - SVMs' training time and testing time are an order of magnitude faster than ANNs', and (3) Scalability - SVMs scale much better than ANNs. SVMs, therefore, provide suitable tools for building signature-based IDSs. We describe our investigation methodology, report experimental results, and conclude by describing an ongoing effort of a SVM and agents-based IDS that delivers enhanced performance, that possesses enhanced intrusion response capability and that is applicable to wireless networks.","1062-922X","0-7803-7952-7","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244585","","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Computer science;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Machine intelligence;Neural networks;Scalability;Support vector machines;Testing","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","DARPA;SVM;agents based IDS;artificial intelligent techniques;artificial neural networks;intrusion detection system;intrusion evaluation data;intrusion response capability;kernel functions;scalability;signature based IDS;support vector machines;testing time;training time;wireless networks","","6","","22","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This feature selection algorithm consists in a compactness analysis of scatterplots to find the most relevant features providing high separability abilities. A high relevance value of a scatterplot means better predictability among of classes based on two features. We take advantage of this information to generate a ranking for features usefulness. We compared our method to two well-known feature selection methods using three real medical datasets. All of them were compared regarding the dimensionality of the final feature vector and the retrieval effectiveness measured by the precision and recall graphs. The performed experiments show that our method not only obtained the highest retrieval performance but also achieved the smallest number of demanded features (dimensionality) than the other methods analyzed.","","978-1-4673-4803-4","","10.1109/HISB.2012.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6366194","CFS;Feature selection;Information Gain;Medical Images;Scatterplot;chi-squared","Biomedical imaging;Equations;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Power capacitors;Redundancy;Vectors","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;graph theory;image retrieval;medical image processing;relevance feedback","FSCoMS;content-based medical image retrieval;feature extraction;feature ranking;feature selection-based on the compactness measure from scatterplots;feature vector dimensionality;medical datasets;precision graphs;recall graphs;relevance value;separability abilities","","0","","29","","","27-28 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the computational burden increases as well. The best compromise between the description accuracy and the computational complexity is given by a derivation of the Minimum Message Length (MML) information criterion. The normal network behavior is assumed to be interpreted by the cluster with the highest covariance matrix, while the other smaller components are considered representing anomalies.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques build intrusion detection models adaptively. Random forests is an efficient data mining algorithm which can be used for network intrusion detection This can be used for real time intrusion detection.

To provide secure and reliable services in cloud computing environment is an important issue. One of the security issues is how to reduce the impact of denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) in this environment. To counter these kinds of attacks, a framework of cooperative intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed. The proposed system could reduce the impact of these kinds of attacks. To provide such ability, IDSs in the cloud computing regions exchange their alerts with each other. In the system, each of IDSs has a cooperative agent used to compute and determine whether to accept the alerts sent from other IDSs or not. By this way, IDSs could avoid the same type of attack happening. The implementation results indicate that the proposed system could resist DoS attack. Moreover, by comparison, the proposed cooperative IDS system only increases little computation effort compared with pure Snort based IDS but prevents the system from single point of failure attack.","1530-2016","978-1-4244-7918-4","978-0-7695-4157-0","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599084","cloud computing;cooperative intrusion detection system;denial-of-service attack;distributed denial-of-service attack","Cloud computing;Clouds;Computer crime;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Simulation","Internet;security of data;software agents","DoS attack;Internet;cloud computing networks;cloud computing region exchange;cooperative IDS system;cooperative agent;cooperative intrusion detection system framework;distributed denial-of-service attack","","20","1","10","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we develop a formal model that allows us to quantitatively reason about the outcomes of the policy enforcement process in both absolute (i.e., user to ideal case) and relative (i.e., user to user) terms. Within this framework, it becomes possible to quantify, e.g., the robustness of a user's proof of authorization to possible perturbations in the system, how close an unauthorized user is to satisfying a particular policy, and relative “top-k” style rankings of the best users to carry out a particular task. To this end, we explore several interesting classes of scoring functions for assessing the robustness of authorization decisions, and develop criteria under which these types of functions can be composed with one another. We further show that these types of functions can be extended to quantify how close unauthorized users are to satisfying policies, which can be a useful risk metric for decision making under unexpected circumstances.","1940-1434","978-1-4244-7510-0","978-1-4244-7511-7","10.1109/CSF.2010.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5552647","access control;policy;risk;trust management","Authorization;Construction industry;Context;Decision making;Measurement;Robustness","authorisation;conformance testing;decision making;theorem proving","authorization;binary decision problem;decision making;formal model;policy compliance testing;policy enforcement process;proof quantitative analysis;relative top-k style rankings;trust management process","","1","","33","","","17-19 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that by correlating the information on different layers, we can have a more efficient anomaly detection system. We introduce an anomaly detection system based on the layer correlation. Bayesian networks and statistical analysis are used to build normal system models for the anomaly detection engine.

Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction, and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each device to continuously maintain the information required to properly route traffic. Such networks may operate by themselves or may be connected to the larger Internet. As the importance of MANET increases day to day, the vulnerability issues in MANET is important to be considered. The main issue concerned with MANET is partial dropping, ambiguous collisions, collusion. The implementation of a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs.

We use the bus nodes as the cluster-heads to gather the routing control messages and data packets transmitted among the vehicles. The bus nodes first transmit the original network behavior information to the access points deployed along the road sides. Then the access points can get a global view of the VANETs, and we can detect anomaly behaviors through analyzing the data. The anomaly detection method is based on the neural network which can build the normal network behavior model through learning process. After the trained neural network is stable, it can monitor the VANETs security by detecting the network control message and data packet in real time and alarm immediately if there is anomaly behavior. The experiments in NS2 show that the detection method can detect anomaly behavior with low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-5821-9","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497798","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Neural networks;Routing;Spine;Spread spectrum communication;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;neural nets;packet radio networks;security of data;system buses;telecommunication network routing;vehicles","BUSNet;NS2;VANET;data packet;dynamic topology;intrusion detection system;learning;multihop cooperative routing;neural network;routing control;vehicular ad hoc networks","","1","","25","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To analyze and design detection and defense mechanisms for CPSs requires new system frameworks. In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously known designs.","","978-1-4799-7746-8","","10.1109/CDC.2014.7039433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7039433","","Algorithm design and analysis;Control systems;Detectors;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Security;Stochastic processes","security of data;stochastic games","CPS;Nash equilibrium strategies;attackers;control cost;cyber state;cyber-physical systems;defense mechanisms;defense policies;detection mechanisms;detection mode;moving-horizon hybrid stochastic game model;physical states;saddle-point equilibrium policy;secure control;switching strategies;system dynamics;system frameworks;system security overhead;zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Approaches for an automated re-use of design and modeling decisions of available signatures also do not exist. In this paper we present an approach for systematic engineering of signatures which is based on the re-use of existing signatures. It exploits similarities with known attacks for the engineering process. The method applies an iterative abstraction of signatures.

It is hard to defend network infrastructure via the SOC, which is operated by an internet service provider (ISP). It is thus important to predict new security threats and share incidents that occur with related ISPs. In the case of Japan, the Telecom Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Telecom-ISAC) Japan is established for a federation scheme with ISP operators against serious security incidents. In this research, we design a federation SOC framework that monitors wide-area networks and analyzes multi-point traffic using statistical approaches. It can suggest anomalous ISPs and traffic parameters automatically. Moreover, we propose an attack forecast technique to ensure a swift response to regular and new attacks.

In addition, there is no clear way to determine which particular combinations of defense decisions result in cost-effective solutions. To address these problems, this paper introduces a layered decision model (LDM) for use in deciding how to address defense decisions based on cost-effectiveness. To illustrate the technique, the LDM model is applied to the design of network defense for a sample e-commercial business. While there is a proliferation of tools for decision support, the connectivity between decisions about security policies, defense strategies and defense tactics is weak and there is no guarantee that these decisions are consistent. It is also hard to tell how a cost decision of one kind (e.g., about goals) affects cost outcomes at another level (e.g., regarding tactics). We present a layered decision model to support consistent, connected decisions at three layers: security policies, defense strategies, and defense tactics, and to balance costs at all layers. The layered decision model (LDM) integrates decisions about security policies, defense strategies and defense tactics in a uniform framework. In addition, this model provides an analytical framework that allows traceability of costs between layers. This framework combines risk assessment, business cost modeling, and cost-benefit analysis which uses return on investment (ROI) analysis. The work in this paper is preliminary, but should provide a good foundation for future work in this area.","","0-7803-9093-8","","10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1506524","","Computer science;Cost benefit analysis;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Investments;Protection;Real time systems;Risk analysis;Risk management;Security","computer networks;cost-benefit analysis;decision support systems;risk management;security of data;telecommunication security","business cost modeling;cost-benefit analysis;cost-effective defense strategy;cost-effective network defense;decision support tool;e-commercial business;layered decision model;network safeguard;real-time defense tactic;return on investment analysis;risk assessment;security policy","","1","","23","","","15-17 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We handle missed detections through the analysis of network vulnerability dependencies, unlike previous approaches that infer hypothetical attacks. In particular, we quantify lack of knowledge through attack graph distance. We show that low-pass signal filtering of event correlation sequences improves results in the face of erroneous detections. We also show how a correlation threshold can be applied for creating strongly correlated attack scenarios.

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-0989-9","978-1-4673-0988-2","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic","","5","","15","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This distributed security model adopts a bottom-up approach such that each cluster of end-user hosts is first secured using the CSG architecture. These different CSGs are then centrally managed by the Network Administrator. A file-based firewall update mechanism is used for dynamic real-time security. IPsec is used to secure the firewall policy update distribution while X.509 certificates cater for sender/receiver authentication. The major benefits of this approach to distributed security include tamper resistance, anti-spoofing, anti-sniffing, secure real-time firewall updating, low overall network load, high scalability and low firewall convergence times.","","978-1-4244-2912-7","978-1-4244-2913-4","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808875","Layer 2 per-packet load balancing;distributed cluster security;distributed firewall;stateful CSG architecture","Authentication;Convergence;Filtering;Load management;Protection;Prototypes;Robustness;Scalability;Security;Software prototyping","authorisation;distributed processing","cluster security gateway architecture;distributed firewall architecture;dynamic real-time security;file-based firewall update mechanism;firewall policy update distribution;network administrator;receiver authentication;robust distributed security;sender authentication","","2","","31","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching.

For this reason, most existing intrusion detection techniques have not met the requirements for practical deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a theoretical basis for intrusion detection to argue about their principles and to analyze the existing problems for intrusion detection in a quantified manner. The root causes of these problems are identified as model inaccuracy and model incompleteness as well as the distinguishability lack in the features utilized.

The visualization technology of the front for wireless security will be developed as the form which integrates the wireless network visualization technology and wireless network mapping technology.","","978-0-7695-3322-3","","10.1109/NCM.2008.187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4623991","network situational awareness;wireless securitym visuzliation","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Couplings;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Visualization;Wireless networks","data visualisation;radio networks;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","intrusion detection system;security situation awareness;wireless network mapping;wireless network visualization;wireless security systems","","1","","13","","","2-4 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, Internet brings people not only convenience but also great potential threats. Facts show that potential safety hazards exist from the emergence of internet. As a kind of effective information security safeguard measure, intrusion detection makes up for the defects of traditional security protection techniques. As a kind of effective data analysis method, data mining is introduced into intrusion detection systems. This paper puts forward the idea of applying data mining technology to intrusion detection systems and then designs data preprocessing module, association analysis module and cluster module respectively.","","978-0-7695-3654-5","","10.1109/ICSPS.2009.202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5166810","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Data security;Hardware;Hazards;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Safety;Software systems","Internet;data analysis;data mining;security of data","Internet technology;association analysis module;cluster module;data analysis method;data mining algorithm;data preprocessing module;hardware equipment;intrusion detection system;security protection techniques;software system","","2","","7","","","15-17 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To identify the real intentions of an attacker can support decision-making of the network security administrator. In this paper a method based on network security states graph to recognize intrusive intention is presented. Algorithms of intention recognition and threat assessment offer a way to assess the network security situation. Feasibility and validity of this method are proved from the experiments.","","978-1-4244-3692-7","978-1-4244-3693-4","10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302778","","Artificial intelligence;Availability;Data security;Databases;Decision making;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Tin","decision support systems;security of data;software agents","attacker intention;decision-making support;intention recognition algorithm;intrusive intention;network security;security states graph;threat assessment algorithm","","0","","10","","","24-26 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although motive and opportunity are required to commit maleficence, this paper focuses on the concept of opportunity. Opportunity is more tangible than motive, hence it is more pragmatic to reflect on opportunity-reducing measures. Opportunity theories from the field of criminology are considered to this end. The derived framework highlights several areas of research and may assist organisations in designing controls that are situationally appropriate to mitigate insider threat. Current information security countermeasures are not designed from an opportunity-reducing perspective.","","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641060","insider threat;rational choice theory;routine activities theory;situational crime prevention theory","Generators;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Social network services;Standards","security of data","conceptual opportunity-based framework;information security countermeasures;insider threat mitigation;opportunity-reducing measures","","0","","54","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In view of the problem in the existing intrusion detection system such as poor collaboration, the low detection efficiency and so on, a dynamic model of intrusion prevention based on vaccine is proposed in this paper, in which the evolution process of self, antigen, antibody and vaccine is time-varying. The fitness of antibodies in the model is improved by vaccines with the result that the detection performance of the model is improved significantly. The experimental results show that the new model actualizes an active and dynamic prevention policy than that of the traditional passive intrusion prevention systems.","","978-1-4799-2760-9","","10.1109/BMEI.2013.6747006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747006","IDS;artificial immune system;network defense;vaccine","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Computers;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Vaccines","drug delivery systems;drugs;molecular biophysics;proteins","active prevention policy;antibodies;antigen;defense system;detection efficiency;dynamic model;dynamic prevention policy;evolution process;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention;modern immunology theory;network intrusion detection;vaccine","","0","","15","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim is to highlight the current state of the research; which are the problems found, and what solutions have been suggested. We have structured our investigation by categorizing the research into the following five categories: problems in the in-vehicle network, architectural security features, intrusion detection systems, honeypots, and threats and attacks. We conclude that even though quite some effort has already been expended in the area, most of it has been directed towards problem definition and not so much towards security solutions. We also highlight a few areas that we believe are of immediate concern.","1931-0587","978-1-4577-0890-9","","10.1109/IVS.2011.5940525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5940525","","Authentication;Intrusion detection;Logic gates;Protocols;Taxonomy;Vehicles","automobiles;mobile radio;telecommunication security","architectural security features;connected car security;honeypots;in-vehicle network;intrusion detection systems;security aspects","","13","","33","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though multiple layers of defense are provided at perimeter, network, host, application and data levels, it is still becoming a challenge to address malware related problems. They have grown in number as well as complexity and are responsible for attacks ranging from denial-of-service to compromising online banking accounts. In recent times, blended attacks are popular with high severity of damage and are difficult to address using signature based anti-malware solutions. Signature based anti-malware solutions are not able to completely detect and block malware behavior. Though heuristic based anti-malware solutions are able to increase the detection rate, their false positive rate is high. Application whitelisting is effective but creates rigidity on environment. Through this paper we analyzed positive as well as negative security models and proposed a practical security framework for combating malware threat, considering the nature of Information Technology (IT) systems and their business objective.","","978-1-4673-1108-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280201","Anamoly Detection;Application Whitelisting;Heuristic based;Malware;Mission Critical;Negative Security Model;Positive Security Model;Practical Business Security;Signature based;Specification based","Fires;Internet;Malware;Mission critical systems;Software","business data processing;invasive software","IT systems;application whitelisting;business security framework;denial-of-service attack;information technology;malware threats;online banking accounts;signature based anti-malware solutions","","1","","10","","","10-12 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
