Building effective IDSs, unfortunately, has remained an elusive goal owing to the great technical challenges involved; and applied AI techniques are increasingly being utilized in attempts to overcome the difficulties. This paper presents a comparative study of using support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and linear genetic programs (LGPs) for intrusion detection. We investigate and compare the performance of IDSs based on the mentioned techniques, with respect to a well-known set of intrusion evaluation data gathered by Lincoln Labs. Through a variety of experiments and analysis, it is found that, with appropriately chosen population size, program size, crossover rate and mutation rate, LGPs outperform other techniques in terms of detection accuracy at the expense of time. SVMs outperform MARS and ANNs in three critical aspects of intrusion detection: accuracy, training time, and testing time.","1082-3409","0-7695-2038-3","","10.1109/TAI.2003.1250243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250243","","Artificial intelligence;Computer networks;Computer security;Control systems;Intrusion detection;Mars;Physics computing;Protection;Support vector machines;Terrorism","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;genetic algorithms;neural nets;safety systems;splines (mathematics);support vector machines","ANN;IDS;Lincoln Labs;MARS;SVM;artifical neural network;artificial intelligence;cyber attack;cyber security;cyber terrorism;information security;intrusion detection;intrusion evaluation data;linear genetic program;multivariate adaptive regression splines;network computer;physical security;support vector machine","","13","","26","","","3-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It runs a target system in a virtual machine (VM) and enables IDSes to monitor the VM from the outside using VM introspection. Although VM introspection is well studied, its performance has not been reported in detail. The performance becomes important when users choose virtualization software, e.g., Xen and KVM. However, the performance comparison is difficult because there is no efficient implementation of VM introspection in KVM. In this paper, we first propose KVMonitor for efficient VM introspection in KVM. Using KVMonitor, we have ported Transcall for offloading legacy IDSes. For memory introspection, KVMonitor was 32 times faster than the existing LibVMI. Then we present performance comparison between Xen and KVM on VM introspection. The experimental results showed that checking the kernel memory with KVMonitor was 118 times faster than that in Xen. Even for legacy chkrootkit, the execution time with KVMonitor was 63% shorter than that in Xen.","","978-1-4799-6473-4","","10.1109/PRDC.2014.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974789","IDS offloading;intrusion detection systems;security;virtual machine introspection;virtualization software","Kernel;Monitoring;Registers;Servers;Virtualization","security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","IDS offloading;KVM software;KVMonitor;Transcall;VM introspection;Xen software;intrusion detection system;legacy chkrootkit;memory introspection;virtual machines","","0","","39","","","18-21 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The benchmark scenarios are developed by sampling features of attacks, legitimate traffic and topologies from the real Internet. We have also developed a measure of DoS impact on network services to evaluate the severity of an attack and the effectiveness of a proposed defense. The benchmarks are integrated with the testbed via the experimenter's workbench - a collection of traffic generation tools, topology and defense library, experiment control scripts and a graphical user interface. Benchmark scenarios provide inputs to the workbench, bypassing the user's selection of topology and traffic settings, and leaving her only with the task of selecting a defense, its configuration and deployment points. Jointly, the benchmarks and the experimenter's workbench provide an easy, point-and-click environment for DoS experimentation and defense testing.","","978-1-4244-0739-2","978-1-4244-0739-2","10.1109/TRIDENTCOM.2007.4444680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444680","","Assembly;Benchmark testing;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Internet;Libraries;Network topology;Sampling methods;Security;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;graphical user interfaces;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;testing","DETER Testbed;Internet;comprehensive benchmark scenarios;defense library;denial-of-service attacks;graphical user interface;point-and-click environment;traffic generation tools","","4","","22","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this approach, we first model system actors' rationale for delivery of the service function. Then, we model a malicious actor whose intention is to disable the system functionality by exploiting their knowledge about the service and potential attacks. We assume that attackers have full knowledge about the system, which is the worst case scenario.

Modern autonomic message-oriented middleware platforms have stringent requirements for self-healing, adapting, evolving, fault-tolerance, security and active vulnerability assessment, especially when the internal working model of a system and the environmental influences on the system are uncertain during run-time. In this paper we present an adaptive and evolving security (AES), and an adaptive trust management (ATM) approach to such autonomic messaging middleware systems, an approach that learns, anticipates, evolves and adapts to a changing environment at run-time in the face of changing threats.

This involves analysis of how the principles of AES and ATM can be applied to the environment resulting in the development of theoretical models which are then tested in practice by prototyping.","","978-1-4244-5113-5","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336915","Adaptive security;evolution;resilience;security metrics;security monitoring;self-healing;trust management","Adaptive systems;Communication system security;Communication systems;Environmental management;Fault tolerant systems;Message-oriented middleware;Prototypes;Robustness;Runtime environment;Testing","fault tolerant computing;middleware;security of data","active vulnerability assessment;autonomic message-oriented middleware platform;fault-tolerance;secure adaptive system;trust management","","1","","27","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increasing the quality and reliability of the software has become the major objective of software development industry. Researchers and industry practitioners, look for innovative techniques and methodologies that could be used to increase their confidence in the software reliability. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is one method under study at the Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC) of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to determine its relevance to increasing the quality and the reliability of software. This paper briefly reviews some of the previous research in the area of software fault tree analysis (SFTA). Next we discuss a roadmap for application of the SFTA to software, with special emphasis on object-oriented design. This is followed by a brief discussion of the paradigm for transforming a software design artifact (i.e., sequence diagram) to its corresponding software fault tree. Finally, we discuss challenges, advantages and disadvantages of SFTA.","","0-7695-2064-2","","10.1109/SEW.2003.1270745","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270745","","Application software;Computer industry;Fault trees;Programming;Software design;Software quality;Software reliability;Software safety;Space technology;US Department of Transportation","fault trees;object-oriented programming;safety-critical software;software quality","NASA Goddard Space Flight Center;object-oriented software design;safety-critical systems;software design artifact;software development;software fault tree analysis;software quality;software reliability;software validation","","4","","15","","","3-4 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the manager becomes a bottleneck for being connected by each client. It can even overload when too many clients request service simultaneously. The whole system may collapse when the central manager is attacked. And these systems are passive to detect and deal with the secure problem. We present a mobile agent-based P2P model for autonomous security hole discovery (MASHD). It can detect infection and network intrusion based on knowledge of the local host. Viruses are removed and connections are refused after identification. In case of a suspicious activity, MASHD initiates a voting approach to make a collective decision and take further action. The integration of peer-to-peer behavior with mobile agents reduces latency and load; however, flexibility, effectivity, security and cooperation of the system are enhanced.","","0-7695-2432-X","","10.1109/CIT.2005.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1562741","","Computer science;Computer security;Computer viruses;Engineering management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Voting","authorisation;computer viruses;mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing","autonomous security hole discovery;computer viruses;mobile agent;network intrusion;peer-to-peer computing;security system","","1","","7","","","21-23 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the IANA pool of IPv4 addresses has run out, IPv6 will become increasingly important. Although the IPv6 protocol stack presents considerable advantages compared with the IPv4 protocol stack, IP source address spoofing is still exploited in IPv6 to initiate malicious attacks. Some techniques are proposed and deployed to implement source address validation at fine granularity. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of fine granularity IP source address validation, e.g. whether filtering technology is deployed to prevent hosts from using forged IP address. We develop a detection tool with controlled spoofing ability which can infer whether the function of filtering spoofing address packets is enabled. We run this tool in 12 famous universities in China and collect the testing data. We gather a total of 41373 probes from 324 clients, and each probe includes sending at least 5 packets with the same spoofing source address to the control server. Results reveal that, 77.02% of the spoofing probes are completely filtered, 0.29% of the spoofing probes are partly filtered and the rest spoofing probes are not filtered at all. Overall, this illustrates that techniques of source address validation have been widely deployed in campus networks. Our statistical results provide practical basis for the deployment and further development of source address validation protocols in IPv6 networks.","","978-1-4577-1668-3","","10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077038","IPV6;efficiency;fine granularity;source address validation;spoofing","Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Wireless networks","IP networks;computer network security;protocols","IANA pool;IPv4 addresses;IPv6 protocol;detection tool;fine granularity;malicious attacks;source address validation;spoofing address packet filtering","","1","","20","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed model in the term of error equal rate.","","978-1-4799-0078-7","","10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707175","Anomaly detection;Database intrusion detection;Database security;Role-based profiling","Data structures;Database systems;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Vectors","Bayes methods;SQL;authorisation;pattern classification;query processing","IDS;NBC;RBAC database system;anomaly detection approach;compact data structure;error equal rate;hexplet;intrusion detection systems;naive Bayes classifier;normal database access behavior;raw transactional SQL queries;role administrated database;role-based access control database system;transaction-based approach;transaction-log entry;valuable information resources","","0","","20","","","26-28 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MILCOM 2009. IEEE","20100115","2009","","","1","7","This paper explores the robust routing of messages among individuals. Traditional routing assumes individuals provide messages to a device connected to a communications network that assumes all responsibility for message delivery. Although each individual may have links to multiple communication devices (office computer, PDA, cell phone), messages are delivered only if there is an end-to-end communication path between communication devices available to each individual. To improve robustness of communication, especially in dynamic ad hoc military networks, this paper models a novel routing paradigm using an integrated communication and social network. The understanding is that individuals can and do route messages through a social network in conjunction with the communication network. An example of this is an individual asking another in his immediate social network to place a call on his behalf when the official communication system is not convenient or is unavailable. We show that it is possible to route messages through the integrated social and communication network by: a) using the ORA social analysis tool to select normalized costs for the social and communication network links (e.g., to reflect the link delay, quality or robustness), and b) using the MONOPATI communication design tool to model the integrated socio-communication network as a graph and performing QoS routing. Results show that the robustness of message delivery can be improved by 5X through this joint routing, without unnecessary impacts on end to end latency.","","978-1-4244-5238-5","978-1-4244-5239-2","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379848","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379848","","","ad hoc networks;electronic messaging;military communication;quality of service;telecommunication network routing","MONOPATI communication design tool;ORA social analysis tool;QoS routing;dynamic ad hoc military networks;end-to-end communication path;integrated communication;message delivery;message routing;multiple communication devices;sociocommnunication network","","2","","18","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To exclusively discriminate illegitimate nodes, we propose a method of using multiple and multiple-angle measurements of a Wi-Fi network nodepsilas signal strength. In this paper we present a real time unsupervised analysis method for identifying duplicate Wi-Fi network nodes which are physically separate.

This plane aims at optimizing existing applications by using elaborate algorithms fed by pertinent knowledge recovered from the knowledge plane. In our approach, we demonstrate that the knowledge and the piloting planes are complementary and both are required when implementing autonomic solutions. We illustrate our proposal by applying these concepts on the handover selection phase which is a key issue in the handover process for granting global mobility to users in heterogeneous environment.

In this paper, we introduce a novel simulation-optimization method that tackles this problem. It combines rich conceptual modeling of security knowledge with discrete event simulation and metaheuristic optimization techniques. By simulating attacks, the method infers possible routes of attack and identifies emergent weaknesses while accounting for adversaries' heterogeneous objectives, capabilities, and available modes of entry. The optimization iteratively adapts the system model by means of a genetic algorithm and optimizes its ability to detect ongoing attacks and prevent their successful execution.

To the outside, all ports and all IP addresses appear open in an OpenFire network. OpenFire uses the honeypot concept in its design. However, unlike traditional honeypots, OpenFire attempts to present additional false targets by making it appear to an attacker that all ports, including unused ones, and all unused IP addresses of an organization are open, with the thesis that this will help divert attacks from real services to false services. In our experiments, we defined an attack to be snort’s priority 1 alert. During a 21-day evaluation period, we found that OpenFire reduced the number of attacks on real services by 65% as compared to an unprotected system and by 46% as compared to a Honeypot-protected system.

It is also not enough to detect already-known intrusions, yet-unseen attacks or variations of those known present a real challenge in the design of these systems.

Proceedings 17th Annual","20020807","2001","","","219","229","Traditional database security mechanisms are very limited in defending successful data attacks. Authorized but malicious transactions can make a database useless by impairing its integrity and availability. The paper presents the design of a real-time data attack isolation system, denoted DAIS. DAIS isolates likely suspicious actions before a definite determination of intrusion is reported. In this way, the database can be immunized from many malicious transactions. DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991538","","Data security;Database systems;Face detection;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems;Transaction databases","SQL;authorisation;data integrity;database management systems;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;transaction processing","COTS-DBMS-specific implementation;DAIS;Informix;Microsoft SQL Server;Oracle;Oracle Server;Sybase;authorized malicious transactions;commercial database applications;data attacks;database application platforms;database security mechanisms;end user transparency;first DAIS prototype;general isolation algorithm;integrity;intrusion tolerance;likely suspicious actions;malicious transactions;real-time data attack isolation system;transaction profiles;user SQL statements","","3","","33","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples include buffer overflow attacks, flooding attacks, system break-ins, etc. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a key role in detecting such malicious activities and enable administrators in securing network systems. Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses. Various design choices that were made to make this system practical and difficulties faced in integrating with existing models are also described.

When the threat (intrusion) is detected, the workflow system needs to be stopped immediately to avoid any possible loss of enterprise data. The system becomes active again, once it is completely recovered from the threat. This proposed framework overcomes the problem of discontinuity of services as a result of threat detection by enabling the execution of the workflow on an alternate path, keeping the security and integrity of the asset information intact. Hence the system remains available all the time in a secured fashion making it possible for the end user to access the services and data even in the vulnerable state. To achieve the specified goals, the special authentication mechanism has been adopted to authorize the users after threat is detected. Then the data is hibernated that is transferred to the designed dimensions and the connectivity and access to the hibernated data is provided by the chameleon agent. These three core components enable the workflow to execute in a secured and robust manner during system's unsafe state.","","978-1-4244-5726-7","978-1-4244-5727-4","10.1109/ICCSN.2010.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437598","Chameleon;Hibernation;IDS (Intrusion Detection System);WFMS (Workflow Management Systems)","Authentication;Availability;Communication system software;Computer networks;Customer satisfaction;Data privacy;Data security;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Workflow management software","security of data;workflow management software","asset information;authentication mechanism;chameleon agent;enterprise data loss;hibernated data;service discontinuity problem;threat detection;workflow management systems;workflows alternate execution","","5","","24","","","26-28 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Snap is based on the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural features that support batched packet processing, memory structures optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with in-order completion. We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier. In this configuration, Snap is able to forward 40 million packets per second, saturating four 10 Gbps NICs at packet sizes as small as 128 byes.

This scheme extracts a small quantity of samples to run the test, instead of regulating the total times of test in advance. It decides whether continue the test or not based on the test result until it obtains the final conclusion.

In 2010, 132 police officers lost their lives in various operations against militants and extremists in India. We have shown how ontology of crime-criminal world can help in establishing intergang relationship. Call records of phones can be analyzed and ontology can link various criminals belonging to various gangs and can predict inter-gang relationship.

This is in spite of the fact that many networks run some type of security mechanism at their connection to the Internet. Large enterprise networks, such as the network for a major university, are very inviting targets to hackers who are looking to exploit networks. Large enterprise networks may consist of many machines running numerous operating systems. These networks normally have enormous storage capabilities and high speed/high bandwidth connections to the Internet. Due to the requirements for academic freedom, system administrators are restricted in what requirements they can place on users on these networks. The high bandwidth usages on these networks make it very difficult to identify malicious traffic within the enterprise network. We propose that a Honeynet can be used to assist the system administrator in identifying malicious traffic on the enterprise network. By its very nature, a Honeynet has no production value and should not be generating or receiving any traffic. Thus, any traffic to or from the Honeynet is suspicious in nature. Traffic from the enterprise network to a machine on the Honeynet may indicate a compromised enterprise system.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232406","","Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;authorisation;bandwidth allocation;business communication;computer crime;message authentication;network operating systems;system monitoring;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Honeynets;Honeypots;Internet;bandwidth requirement;computer crime;computer network;exploited system detection;hacking;intrusion detection;large enterprise network;malicious traffic identification","","28","16","16","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem is approached statistically, as that of sequential (quickest) changepoint detection. A multi-cyclic setting of quickest change detection is a natural fit for this problem. We propose a novel score-based multi-cyclic detection algorithm. The algorithm is based on the so-called Shiryaev-Roberts procedure. This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes. This is confirmed experimentally for real traces. We also discuss the possibility of complementing our anomaly detection algorithm with a spectral-signature intrusion detection system with false alarm filtering and true attack confirmation capability, so as to obtain a synergistic system.","1932-4553","","","10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2233713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6380529","CUSUM;Changepoint detection;Shiryaev–Roberts Procedure;TCP SYN attacks;cybersecurity;distributed denial-of-service attacks;intrusion detection;network traffic","Computer networks;Computer security;Delay;Detection algorithms;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Tin","computer network security","Shiryaev-Roberts procedure;alarm filtering;attack confirmation capability;changepoint detection method;computer network anomaly detection;computer network traffic;cumulative sum chart;exponentially-weighted moving average scheme;likelihood ratio;multicyclic setting;online anomaly detection;score-based multicyclic detection algorithm;sequential changepoint detection;spectral-signature intrusion detection system;synergistic system","","3","","27","","2012-12-12","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thoroughly researched concepts for access control exist and have been proven in mainframe computing. However, they are often not used in today's development of multi-tier applications. One reason may be the lack of appropriate reusable components that support application developers that frequently have to re-invent the wheel when it comes to access controls. The goal of this paper is to promote awareness of security issues when developing applications and to illustrate a suitable approach for that. Our framework called GAMMA (Generic Authorization Mechanisms for Multi-Tier Applications) offers several authentication, access control, and auditing mechanisms. Access control models can be combined or used simultaneously in order to provide application-specific and highly customizable mechanisms.

This paper presents a method to optimize the potential memory usage of DFA based algorithms for multi-pattern expression matching by the combining DFA's paths, named isomorphic path combination (IMPC). To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA. It means that CDFA may be a more proper model for multi-pattern matching than other FAs.","1095-2055","978-1-4577-0637-0","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005927","","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Pattern matching;Registers","optimisation;pattern matching;telecommunication security","CDFA;DFA based algorithms;Snort pattern set;high speed network;isomorphic path combination;memory usage;multipattern expression matching;network security;optimization;packet inspection;pattern sets","","0","","21","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","1-4244-0357-X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932","","Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;invasive software","Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system","","0","","11","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When applied to the same observed activities of computer and network systems, different intrusion detection techniques yield different evaluation results. An information fusion technique is required to fuse different results of various intrusion detection techniques for producing a composite value of intrusion likelihood.

International Conference on","20100112","2009","","","1","10","The packet is the atom of the digital revolution: the unit of data communication. The use of packets in networking was first proposed almost 50 years ago, leading ultimately to the Internet as we know it today. As networking has scaled down towards networks on chip, so packets feature for digital communication in the small. As applications have gone digital, so their data has become packetised. Streams of packets, and the processing of these packets, are characteristic of the digital age. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide numerous packet processing solutions, in order to support diversity and innovation both in services and in underlying infrastructure. In turn, there is a requirement for supplying underlying high-performance architectures that support flexibility, scalability, concurrency, and diversity. These characteristics present a great opportunity for modern field programmable technologies, which offer a very natural basis for providing the necessary high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities. One major barrier for these technologies to overcome is that design, testing and maintenance is very often a low-level, hardware-oriented, experience, requiring specialist skills. A key question is whether the raw capabilities of field programmable devices can be made available to the architect and programmer in a higher-level manner, comparable to best practice in modern software engineering. To supply an initial positive answer, this paper introduces G, a high-level packet-centric language for describing packet processing specifications in an implementation-independent manner, and demonstrates that G can be compiled to give high-performance FPGA-based packet processing components. Compilation involves generating virtual processing architectures tailored to the particular requirements of a G specification. The results affirm the FPGA as a natural packet processing technology that can be programmed in a high-level manner appropriate to a packe- t-oriented mindset.","","978-1-4244-4375-8","978-1-4244-4377-2","10.1109/FPT.2009.5377604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377604","","Best practices;Concurrent computing;Data communication;Digital communication;IP networks;Network-on-a-chip;Programming profession;Scalability;Technological innovation;Testing","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based packet processing components;Internet;data communication;digital revolution;field programmable technology;high-level packet-centric language;high-speed programmable packet processing capabilities;natural packet processing technology;packet-oriented mindset;software engineering","","4","","29","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We therefore propose a non-intrusive approach capable of verifying a user having performed a few times of file-related operations via a mouse. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the mouse movement of the file-related operations in Explorer, which is the most common way to search, open, save, copy, and/or delete files in Windows environments, is used for authentication. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible and has three advantages: 1) it is non-intrusive, 2) it authenticates users in a short period of time, and 3) the quantity of mouse dynamics used for authentication purpose is lightweight.","","978-1-4673-0917-2","","10.1109/ISBAST.2012.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189655","Mouse dynamics;behavioral biometrics;user authentication","Accuracy;Authentication;Biometrics;Mice;Support vector machine classification;Vectors","file organisation;message authentication","Windows environment;data protection;digital asset;file management system;mouse dynamics-related scheme;nonintrusive authentication approach;unauthorized access prevention;user authentication system","","1","","28","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the propagation speed of worms, reactive defenses need to be automatic. It is important to understand where and how these defenses need to fit in the network so that they cannot be easily evaded. As there are several mechanisms malcode authors can use to bypass existing perimeter-centric defenses, this position paper argues that substantial defenses need to be embedded in the local area network, thus creating ""hard-LANs"" designed to detect and respond to worm infections. When compared with conventional network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), we believe that hard-LAN devices need to have two orders of magnitude better cost/performance, and at least two orders of magnitude better accuracy, resulting in substantial design challenges.","","0-7803-8686-8","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375206","","Communication system control;Computer aided software engineering;Computer worms;Costs;Humans;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Payloads;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;local area networks;telecommunication security","automatic reactive defenses;hard-LAN;local area network;malcode authors;network IDS;network intrusion detection systems;network worms;perimeter-centric defenses;propagation speed;self-propagating network programs","","6","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the existing literature, the analysis of the cyber security impacts has been primarily focused from the computer science perspectives investigating potential attacking scenarios and counter-measures through network security strategies. In this paper, we investigate traffic impacts of cyber attacks considering real-world driver behavior, especially the “built-in” safety redundancy of the visual verification by drivers or autonomous driving system. More specifically, we study the impact of “false-accident” attacks on the stability of traffic flow. In the false-accident attack, a vehicle sends out a false accident alert to its surrounding vehicle through CV-enabled network and has considered an attacking scenario that has catastrophic effects. Traffic flow stability is based on widely-used numerical linear stability analysis methods, the ring road test. In such a test, vehicles are restricted within a ring road so that traffic congestion and perturbations appear in cyclic patterns indicating the stability of traffic flow. The study indicates that false-accident attacks do not necessarily yield significant impact on the stability of traffic flow. Sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying the attacking duration, the attacking vehicle position in a platoon, and the CV safety application reaction range.","","","","10.1109/ICCVE.2013.6799866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6799866","Car-Following Dynamics;Connected Vehicle Technologies;Cyber Security;Traffic flow stability","Acceleration;Accidents;Numerical stability;Roads;Safety;Stability analysis;Vehicles","numerical stability;sensitivity analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","CV safety application reaction range;CV systems;CV technologies;CV-enabled network;attacking scenario;attacking vehicle position;autonomous driving system;built-in safety redundancy;computer science perspectives;connected vehicle technologies;countermeasures;cyber security impacts;cyber security issues;cyclic patterns;false accident alert;false-accident attacks;network security strategies;numerical linear stability analysis methods;perturbations;real-world driver behavior;ring road test;sensitivity analysis;traffic congestion;traffic flow stability;vehicular network;visual verification","","1","","25","","","2-6 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are becoming ubiquitous and have been widely used to transfer critical information, such as banking accounts, credit cards, e-mails, and social network credentials. The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, several machine learning techniques have been proposed to automate and develop intelligent network forensics systems. An intelligent network forensics system that reconstructs intrusion scenarios and makes attack attributions requires knowledge about intrusions signatures, evidences, impacts, and objectives. In addition, problem solving knowledge that describes how the system can use domain knowledge to analyze malicious activities is essential for the design of intelligent network forensics systems. In this paper we adapt recent researches in semantic-web, information architecture, and ontology engineering to design a method ontology for network forensics analysis. The proposed ontology represents both network forensics domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge. It can be used as a knowledge-base for developing sophisticated intelligent network forensics systems to support complex chain of reasoning. We use a real life network intrusion scenario to show how our ontology can be integrated and used in intelligent network forensics systems.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593235","","Cognition;Forensics;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Ontologies;Problem-solving","computer forensics;computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence)","computer networks;information architecture;intelligent network forensics analysis;machine learning techniques;ontology engineering;problem solving knowledge;semantic-web","","2","","15","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the hysteresis and incompleteness of the signature establishment as well as the inaccuracy of statistics probability model, the effectiveness of traditional signature-based and statistics-based anomaly detection methods are directly restricted. Besides, the species and complexity of anomaly behaviors are varying so fast along with the outbreak of network traffic and the influence of high-speed access. It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph (FL-LPVG), which constructs complex networks based on the network flow series. This method mines structural behavior patterns of the associated graph and detects anomaly traffic through data mining and entropy-based information theoretic techniques. Experiments on KDD Cup 99 dataset demonstrate that this method greatly simplify the process of anomaly detection, and effectively reduce dimensionality of high-dimensional data, and at the same time this method gets a good detection effect.","","","978-1-84919-729-8","10.1049/cp.2013.2470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826019","Anomaly Classification;Anomaly Detection;Limited Penetrable Visibility Graph;Machine Learning","","computer network security;data mining;entropy;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","FL-LPVG;anomaly behaviors;anomaly traffic detection;associated graph;big data processing;complex networks;data mining;entropy-based information theoretic techniques;flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph;high-dimensional data dimensionality reduction;network flow series;network traffic;network-based anomaly detection methods;signature establishment hysteresis;signature establishment incompleteness;signature-based anomaly detection methods;statistics probability model;statistics-based anomaly detection methods;structural behavior pattern mining","","0","","","","","22-24 Nov. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

A prototype language, called Adaptive Java, is described in which this functionality is realized through extensions to the Java programming language.

Computer network is a dynamic entity whose state changes with the introduction of new services, installation of new network operating system, and addition of new hardware components, creation of new user roles and by attacks from various actors instigated by aggressors. Various security mechanisms employed in the network does not give the complete picture of security of complete network. In this paper we have proposed taxonomy and ontology which may be used to infer impact of various events happening in the network on security status of the network. Vulnerability, Network and Attack are the main taxonomy classes in the ontology. Vulnerability class describes various types of vulnerabilities in the network which may in hardware components like storage devices, computing devices or networks devices. Attack class has many subclasses like Actor class which is entity executing the attack, Goal class describes goal of the attack, Attack mechanism class defines attack methodology, Scope class describes size and utility of the target, Automation level describes the automation level of the attack Evaluation of security status of the network is required for network security situational awareness. Network class has network operating system, users, roles, hardware components and services as its subclasses. Based on this taxonomy ontology has been developed to perceive network security status. Finally a framework, which uses this ontology as knowledgebase has been proposed.","","978-1-4799-2290-1","","10.1109/RAECS.2014.6799584","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6799584","Network Security Status;Network Situational awareness;Ontology;Taxonomy","Automation;Computer networks;Hardware;Manuals;Ontologies;Security;Taxonomy","computer network security;network operating systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","computer network security;network operating system;ontology;taxonomy classes","","0","","21","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the scheme, the original private key is generated with bionic evolution algorithm by a successive optimizing process. The optimizing selection algorithm renders effective protection for the private key and the signature system, avoids the insecure randomness in secret parameter selection, and thus prevents generalized signature forgery and coalition attack of original signer and proxy signers. The algorithms of the scheme take great advantage of the superiority of ECC (elliptic curves cryptosystem), such as high efficiency, short key length and etc. The scheme can achieve the same security with less storing space, smaller communication band-width and less overheads of the system and thus proves to be applicable to such circumstances as with restricted computation ability and integrated space, circumstances with limited bandwidth yet requiring for high-speed operation.","","978-0-7695-3859-4","","10.1109/IITA.2009.503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369403","bionic evolution;elliptic curves;private key optimization;proxy signature;system efficiency","Artificial intelligence;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Evolution (biology);Evolutionary computation;Forgery;Genetic mutations;Genetic programming;Machine learning algorithms;Security","artificial intelligence;digital signatures;evolutionary computation;public key cryptography","adaptive artificial intelligence technique;bionic evolution;coalition attack;elliptic curve cryptosystem;generalized signature forgery;optimizing selection algorithm;proxy signature scheme","","0","","19","","","21-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is very useful for countries with restricted human rights, but also in all the cases when someone has concerns about being watched or otherwise tracked. The main building blocks of the TOR network are TOR nodes that relay traffic in such way that each node knows for previous and next nodes. The special case are exit nodes that finally deliver traffic to it's intended destination, but that don't know from whom the traffic originates. All the TOR nodes are run by voluntaries throughout the Internet. It turns out that TOR network is heavily misused and thus it is dangerous to run TOR exit nodes as all the misuse of the network appears to be done from the exit nodes which could bring trouble to their owners. In this paper we analyse misuse of the TOR exit nodes and also propose mechanisms that could minimize, or even eliminate, misuse. More specifically, we analyse use of the Honeywall to protect TOR exit node.","","978-1-4244-7763-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5533659","TOR;anonymity;honeypots;onion routing;security","Cryptography;Humans;Internet;Law;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Protocols;Relays;Routing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","0","","5","","","24-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lab., Idaho Falls, ID, USA","Resilient Control Systems (ISRCS), 2012 5th International Symposium on","20120924","2012","","","143","148","In an increasingly connected world, critical infrastructure systems suffer from two types of vulnerability. The first is the traditionally recognized problem of monitoring the systems for faults and failures, recognizing and analyzing data, and responding with real understanding to the problems of the system. Increasingly complex systems create the opportunity for single points of failure to cascade when inaccurate assessment of system health increases response time or leads to faulty analysis of the problems involved. A second problem involves vulnerability to cyber intrusion, in which malignant actors can mask system degradation or present false data about system status. A resilient system will protect stability, efficiency, and security. To ensure these three states, the system must react to changing conditions within the system with coordination: no one component of the system can be allowed to react to problems without real consideration of the effects of that action on other components within the system. Systems with multi-agent design typically have three layers of action, a management layer, a coordination layer, and an execution layer. A resilient multi-agent system will emphasize functions of the execution layer, which has the responsibility of initiating actions, monitoring, analyzing, and controlling its own processes, while feeding information back to the higher levels of management and coordination. The design concept of a resilient control system execution agent (ReCoSEA) grows out of these underpinnings, and through the use of computational intelligence techniques, this paper suggests an associated design methodology.","","978-1-4673-0161-9","978-1-4673-0162-6","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309308","agent;control;resilient system","Computer security;Control systems;Fault detection;Process control;Sensor phenomena and characterization","multi-agent systems","ReCoSEA;complex systems;coordination layer;cyber intrusion;data analysis;execution layer;faulty analysis;malignant actors;management layer;multiagent design;resilient control system execution agent","","5","","26","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
