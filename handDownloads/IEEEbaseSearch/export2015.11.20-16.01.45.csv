This is quite different in Computational Grids (CGs) in which several user types should co-exist and make use of resources according to hierarchical nature and the presence of the multiple administrative domains. One implication of the existence of different hierarchical levels in CGs is that it imposes different access and usage policies on resources. In this paper we firstly highlight the most common Grid users types and their relationships and access scenarios in CGs corresponded to old (e.g. performance) and new (e.g security) requirements. Then, we identify and analyze new features arising in users' behavior in Grid scheduling, such as dynamic, selfish, cooperative, trustful, symmetric and asymmetric behaviors. We discuss also how computational economy-based approaches, such as market mechanisms, and computational paradigms, such as Neural Networks, can be used to model user requirements and predict users' behaviors in CGs. As a result of this study we have provided a comprehensive analysis of Grid user scenarios than can serve as a basis for application designers in CGs.","","978-1-4244-8538-3","978-0-7695-4237-9","10.1109/3PGCIC.2010.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5662601","Computational Grids;Game Theory;Neural Networks;Resource Reliability;Scheduling;Security;User Behavior","","distributed processing;grid computing;human computer interaction;scheduling","computational economy based approach;computational grids;distributed computing systems;grid scheduling;multiple administrative domains;user requirements modelling;users behavior","","0","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SCD extends the approaches using decoder in order to achieve the least number of comparison units. The definitions of alphabet help to give the selections of characters for decoding, especially the alphabets of vertical left alignment (Avla). This paper also introduces a pattern matching architecture with alphabet based SCD. This architecture takes full advantages of the idea of pre-decoding and achieves the same high frequency as the one based on decoder while saving more than half resources. The third contribution of this paper is the idea and initial model for resource estimation just based on given pattern sets. To 1197 real patterns in Snort v2.3.3, experimental results show the resources used in alphabet based SCD is just 35.1% of the one in traditional 8-256 decoder.

Although many detection systems have been proposed so far, most of them can detect only part of alteration. Some detection systems use canaries to detect alteration. However, if an execution code has bugs that enable attackers to read data in memory, the system could be bypassed by attackers who can guess canaries. To overcome the problems, we propose a system using alteration of data. Our proposed system detects illegal alteration with verifier for vulnerable data. Verifier is made before vulnerable data could be altered by attackers, and verifier is checked when the program uses the vulnerable data. Part of verifier is stored in kernel area to prevent attackers from reading data in user memory. Our approach can detect illegal alteration of arbitrary data in user memory.

Nodes can change position quite frequently, which mean the mobility of the network. For quick data transmission, we need a routing protocol that adapts to topology changes. For our convenience, we have proposed a fast and secure protocol which is proactive and reactive in nature. In proactive protocol, routing table updates takes place when the topology changes. In routers that use dynamic routing protocols, it is important to have fast convergence because routers could make incorrect forwarding decisions until the network has fully converged. In proactive protocol, when a new node is added in the network it takes some time to converge during that time if we want to send data to destination through that new node immediately, it takes some time to converge and then it will transmit the data. To avoid this problem we are going to use reactive protocol instead of proactive in that time that is until network converge. In proactive protocol structure, we reduced the packet size and contains only limited field. By this, the total bit size gets reduced. We propose this mechanism to avoid waiting time and to transmit data as early as possible. Also we propose a security mechanism for detecting malicious node by using central agent and process algorithm. The proposed work will be simulated in NS2 simulator.","","978-1-4577-1580-8","","10.1109/ICCCI.2012.6158859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158859","MANET;central agent;proactive;process algorithm;reactive","Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;NS2 simulator;autonomous system;central agent;dynamic routing protocol;fast data transmission;malicious node detection;mobile adhoc network;mobile host;multihop wireless link;network mobility;packet size;proactive protocol;process algorithm;reactive protocol;routing table;secure data transmission;security mechanism;topology change","","1","","9","","","10-12 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such fragments may arrive out-of-sequence to escape from being detected by the string matching algorithm of IDS / IPS. The common defense is buffering and reassembling packets. However, buffering of out-of-sequence packets can become impractical on high speed links due to limited fast memory capacity, especially when the concurrent flows are in large quantity, or extremely disordered in circumstances such as attacks. So such buffering strategy is vulnerable to memory exhausting denial of service (DoS). In this paper, AC-Suffix-Tree, a buffer free scheme for string matching is proposed, which detects patterns across out-of-sequence packets without buffering and reassembly. This novel algorithm associates the classical Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm with a pattern suffix tree to search patterns with only the state numbers of AC automaton and suffix tree stored. It demands significantly less memory than buffering the packets themselves. Therefore the IDS can resist memory exhausting DoS attack. AC-Suffix-Tree consumes 1-2 orders of magnitude less memory than buffering the entire packet, and it has the same temporal complexity as AC algorithm when there are no out-of-sequence packets.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","978-0-7695-4521-9","10.1109/ANCS.2011.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062710","Network Security;Packet Reordering;String Matching","Arrays;Automata;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Pattern matching;Security","buffer storage;computer network management;security of data;string matching;transport protocols;tree searching","AC-suffix-tree;TCP/IP fragmentation;buffer free string matching;classical Aho-Corasick algorithm;denial of service;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;out-of-sequence packets;packet reordering;pattern suffix tree;signature detection","","0","","12","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, they are used to instrument the web application at source code level, so that a deviation from the normal profile can be detected at run-time.

The trust system evaluates the nodes' competence and reliability in relaying packets in terms of multi-dimensional trust values. The trust values are attached to the nodes' public-key certificates to be used in making routing decisions. We develop two routing protocols to direct traffic through those highly-trusted nodes having sufficient energy to minimize the probability of breaking the route. By this way, E-STAR can stimulate the nodes not only to relay packets, but also to maintain route stability and report correct battery energy capability. This is because any loss of trust will result in loss of future earnings. Moreover, for the efficient implementation of the trust system, the trust values are computed by processing the payment receipts. Analytical results demonstrate that E-STAR can secure the payment and trust calculation without false accusations.

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.","","978-1-4799-3078-4","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318","Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security","computer network security","OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks","","0","","17","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, the algorithms use the advantage of the improved GA with strong whole searching capacity to search global optimal point in the whole question domain. Then, it adopts the strongpoint of the LM algorithm with fast local searching to fine search near the global optimal point. The paper used respectively the three algorithms, namely the Improved GA, LM algorithm and HNNA, to adjust the input and output parameters of the ANN model, and adopt the theories of the fusion of the multi-classifiers to structure the Intrusion Detection System. By repeatedly experiment, it is found that the HNNA is better in stability and convergence precision than LM algorithm and improved GA from the training result. The testing results are also proved that the detection rate of the multiple classifiers intrusion detection system based on HNNA learning algorithm, including all attack categories that has a few or many training samples, is higher than the IDS that use LM and improved GA learning algorithm, and the false negative rate is less. So, the HNNA is proved to be feasible in theory and practice.","","978-1-4244-8691-5","","10.1109/ICEBEG.2011.5882041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5882041","Intrusion detection;genual algorithm Levenberg-Marquard algorithm;neural network","Artificial neural networks;Classification algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Probes;Testing;Training","","","","0","","9","","","6-8 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the protocol for RAS (Registration, Admission Status) messages, a finite-state machine specification for correct behaviors between a gatekeeper and endpoints is produced. Security requirements against these DoS attacks are established, resulting in a formal protocol specification for secured gatekeepers. Developing the proposal into a practical solution, an intrusion detection module is built and incorporated into the open source software GNU Gatekeeper (also named OpenH323GK).

In this paper, we present the design of automated response mechanisms in an intrusion tolerant system called ADEPTS. Our focus is on enforcing containment in the system, thus localizing the intrusion and allowing the system to provide service, albeit degraded. ADEPTS uses a graph of intrusion goals, called I-GRAPH, as the underlying representation in the system. In response to alerts from an intrusion detection framework, ADEPTS executes algorithms to determine the spread of the intrusion and the appropriate responses to deploy. A feedback mechanism evaluates the success of a deployed response and uses that in guiding future choices. ADEPTS is demonstrated on a distributed e-commerce system and evaluated using a survivability metric.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467825","attack graphs;automated intrusion response;distributed e-commerce systems;intrusion containment;survivability","Computer security;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Electronic commerce;Feedback;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Pattern matching","electronic commerce;fault tolerant computing;graph theory;security of data","attack graph;automated intrusion response;distributed e-commerce system;intrusion detection system;intrusion tolerant system;survivability metric","","11","","19","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture of the probe is based on a network acceleration card with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and a host computer. The configuration for FPGA chips is automatically generated by a configuration program according to the user's definition of the monitored values in order to save hardware resources and increase the throughput. The definition of the monitoring process is described using XML, transformed to VHDL and synthesized.

Thus, the authentication method used by computers on the network affects its safety. Static authentication methods are applied only once at the beginning of a user session. Unfortunately, these methods provide no protection from the interactions a user has after they are logged on and using the system. An ongoing dynamic authentication supplements an intrusion detection system by recognizing a masquerader, or a legitimate user's change of intent. In this paper, we statistically analyze the underlying distributions of the time between user commands and develop an analytic model that emulates the underlying mathematical properties of user behaviors. From this, we show how the probabilities of users executing a sequence of commands during a session can be ascertained.

However, the remote sensing image data's usage rate still remains very low. To solve this problem, we propose a new Service model: Anytime-Anywhere Service (AAService) model, under which users can get remote sensing images anytime and anywhere. Then we implemented and tested our AA-Service System based on this Service model. First of all, we introduced the framework of the AA-Service System. The AAService System includes three units: Data Center, Communication Unit, and User Unit; and provides three kinds of Services: image Service, plotting Service, and update Service. The features of the AA-Service are seamless coverage, all online Service, and efficient distribution. Secondly, we also described the three key technologies of the AA-Service System in this paper: distributing data according to the users' needs, updating remote sensing image partially and transmitting data in an efficient way. In the AA-Service System, the remote sensing image is organized by the global subdivision compression pyramid which enables the System to distribute remote sensing images of different resolution to users according to the users' requests. When the remote sensing image is changing, the System only updates the changed area rather than the whole image. This is different from other image Service models which distribute remote sensing images by scene or map sheet. In addition, this System ensures reliable and efficient data transmission by integrating three communication methods: BeiDou communication, CDMA communication and Internet communication, and using a new packet loss retransmission mechanism. Thirdly, we listed the statistics data of the System test. In the System test, we measured the Qos and consumed time of image Service, plotting Service and update Service respectively. The results show that this AA-Service System can provide the remote sen- - sing images Service anytime and anywhere in a short time and in a good Qos. By using this AA-Service System, the remote sensing image data's usage rate will be increased and users can experience more convenient remote sensing images Service in their daily life.","","978-1-4244-7301-4","","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567681","AA-Service;Global Subdivision Compression Pyramid;Packet loss retransmission Mechanism;Partial-Image Updates;remote sensing images","Computational modeling;Data models;Databases;Image resolution;Internet;Receivers;Remote sensing","Internet;code division multiple access;data communication;geographic information systems;image processing;quality of service;remote sensing;statistical analysis","AA-Service system;AAService model;BeiDou communication;CDMA communication;Internet communication;QoS;all online service;anytime-anywhere-service system;communication unit;data center;data transmission;global subdivision compression pyramid;image service;packet loss retransmission mechanism;plotting service;remote sensing image data;remote sensing technology;seamless coverage;statistics data;update service;user unit","","0","","12","","","18-20 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, primary user emulation, intelligent jamming and denial of service for spectrum usage may impact the performance of classical spectrum sensing approaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cooperative sensing framework that can flexibly incorporate a variety of physical layer features to identify cases related to malicious behavior and genuine node failures. Though our approach is distributed, it is resilient in the sense that it does not simply rely on majority voting by a collection of nearby nodes. The key contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) A multiple criteria analysis technique and a non-parametric Bayesian inference method are formulated for identifying the spectrum holes that are least susceptible to malicious activity and failures, and (ii) Using real traces from the CRAWDAD data repository, we test our framework in a variety of practical settings, to prove the performance benefit of our approach.","2166-9570","","","10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6666573","","Cognitive radio;Noise;Principal component analysis;Probability;Resilience;Security;Sensors","Bayes methods;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","CRAWDAD data repository;catastrophic performance degradation;cognitive radio networks;denial of service;genuine node failures;intelligent jamming;multidimensional cooperative spectrum sensing technique;multiple criteria analysis technique;nonparametric Bayesian inference method;physical layer;primary user emulation;spectrum holes;spectrum usage efficiency","","0","","16","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Studying attacks in a real environment however, is not viable and therefore it is necessary to find other methods how to examine the nature of attacks. Gaining detailed knowledge about them facilitates designing of new detection methods as well as understanding their impact. In this paper we present a testbed framework to simulate attacks that enables to study a wide range of security scenarios. The framework provides a notion of real-world arrangements, yet it retains full control over all the activities performed within the simulated infrastructures. Utilizing the sandbox environment, it is possible to simulate various security attacks and evaluate their impacts on real infrastructures. The design of the framework benefits from IaaS clouds. Therefore its deployment does not require dedicated facilities and the testbed can be deployed over miscellaneous contemporary clouds.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of credit-based networking - borrowing ideas from financial management and adapting them to network management. We first focus on a campus network by studying concrete scenarios of how credit-based network management can be applied. We then discuss how the concept is generally applicable to managing network behaviors as well by applying it to managing ISP peering relationships.

The error injection experiments show that about 2% of errors injected into the firewall code segment cause security vulnerabilities. Two types of error-caused security vulnerabilities are distinguished: temporary, which disappear when the error disappears, and permanent, which persist even after the error is removed, as long as the system is not rebooted. Results from simulating the SAN model indicate that under an error rate of 0.1 error/day during a 1-year period in a networked system protected by 20 firewalls, 2 machines (on the average) will experience security violations. This indicates that error-caused security vulnerabilities can be a non-negligible source of a security threats to a highly secure system.","","0-7695-1101-5","","10.1109/DSN.2002.1028938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028938","","Computer aided instruction;Cryptography;Data security;Error analysis;Hardware;Kernel;Law;Legal factors;Protection;Storage area networks","Unix;authorisation;computer network reliability;network operating systems;telecommunication security","IPChains;Linux kernel;Netfilter;SAN model;Stochastic Activity Network;error injection;error-caused security vulnerabilities;experiment;firewall data corruption;highly secure system;instruction transient errors;security threat;security violations","","1","","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This mimicry traffic is potentially neglected by detectors. In this paper, we propose a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based method for detecting anomalous traffic mimicking legitimate traffic. Our method firstly observes the port pair distribution of traffic flows, which is a novel statistical traffic feature proposed in this work. Secondly, our method computes the KL divergence between the port pair distributions of the current and previous time intervals. Our method starts to find anomalous flows when the KL divergence deviates from a specified threshold. We tested the performance of our method with traffic which was mixed by four synthetic mimicry anomalies and real-world backbone traffic. The results indicated that our method could precisely detect all synthetic anomalies. Furthermore, our method additionally revealed six real-world anomalies that were hidden in the testing backbone traffic.","","","","10.1109/ISNCC.2015.7238570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238570","Kullback-Leibler divergence;Statistical anomaly detection;distance measure;mimicry anomaly;statistical traffic feature","Ash;Computer crime;Detectors;Feature extraction;Histograms;IP networks;Ports (Computers)","security of data;telecommunication traffic","HTTP;KL divergence-based method;Kullback-Leibler divergence;anomalous traffic;legitimate traffic;network-based mimicry anomaly detection;port pair distribution;real-world backbone traffic;statistical traffic feature;synthetic mimicry anomalies;time intervals","","0","","","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This processing involves traversing a linked list and invoking a matching function for each item. Although this task is critical to the performance of the system, microprocessors perform it extremely poorly. Furthermore, the traditional network processor approaches of multicore and multithreading map poorly to the problem because the list is a shared data structure. While match processing can be implemented directly in hardware, hardware implementations can be extremely inflexible and lead to extremely high risk. This paper presents a novel, programmable architecture for a processor to handle the matching function. The matching engine approaches the performance of a direct hardware implementation while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and programmability. More importantly, it requires a dramatically smaller area than a conventional processor.","1552-5244","978-1-4244-1387-4","978-1-4244-1388-1","10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4629234","","Aggregates;Control systems;Data structures;Engines;Hardware;Microprocessors;Multicore processing;Multithreading;Network interfaces;Supercomputers","application program interfaces;data structures;message passing;network interfaces;parallel machines","MPI matching function;NIC;linked list;message passing interface;network interface controller;programmable processor architecture;shared data structure;supercomputer network","","0","","29","","","17-20 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust.

In this paper, a novel NSSA framework is presented. The framework includes two parts: calculate the Network Security Situation Value (NSSV) and discover intrusion processes. NSSA quantitative assesses the impact on network security caused by attacks upon Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and hierarchical network structure.

Vulnerability analysis is a method developed by security engineers to identify the attacks that are relevant for the system under study, and in this paper, the analysis is applied on the communications network topology of the electric grid automation system. Impact analysis is then performed through co-simulation of automation and the electric grid to assess the potential damage from the attacks. This paper makes an extensive review of vulnerability and impact analysis methods and relevant system modeling techniques from the fields of security and industrial automation engineering, with a focus on smart grid automation, and then applies and combines approaches to obtain a security risk analysis methodology.

Based on some improved dynamic clonal selection algorithms, an adaptive intrusion detection algorithm is presented in this paper. According to the algorithm, an intrusion detection system is composed of a self-body antigen set, a memorial immunocyte set, a mature immunocyte set and an immature immunocyte set. An immature immunocyte grows into a mature one if it goes through self-tolerance. A mature immunocyte grows into a memorial one if it matches enough non-self-body antigens in limited time and it goes through co-stimulation. A memorial immunocyte doesn't die until it can't go through co-stimulation. Immature immunocytes are generated with clone and hypermutation methods when necessary. The self-body antigen set is renewed during above co-stimulation.

We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection.

A data-based analysis for major industries is performed, where we map the maximum potential loss of a firm with the optimal cybersecurity budget size and discover that the optimal budget size is independent of the mix of assets that a firm holds. In addition, we also conclude that firms in finance, energy, and technology sectors should invest more in detective technologies than preventive, as oppose to even split in most other industries.

This paper introduces new abstractions for information transfer and data services in the network, which overcome the constraints of the end-to-end argument that has dominated current network designs. The explicit separation of communication and processing allows the composition of a variety of information transfer patterns that expand the capabilities of the network to meet its next-generation challenges. We discuss implementation issues that arise in this network architecture and present several examples of how applications can utilize the proposed abstractions.

They have access to home internal networks which allows an adversary to easily carry out man-in-the-middle attacks and spread infections wirelessly. They can also be used to launch massive denial of service attacks that target the physical infrastructure as well as the RF spectrum (both WiFi and cellular). While Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) vulnerabilities are common knowledge, the flaws of the WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) protocol are less known. In this paper, we use an epidemiological approach, combined with experimental war-driving measurements to investigate the speed of infections spreading in four neighborhoods of Boston, MA, USA, with distinct population and demographics. Our analysis and experimental data indicate that such attacks are feasible. While the graph of WEP APs and WPS APs may not be fully connected, the combined graph of WEP-WPS APs is fully connected, making large scale spreading of infections feasible. Due to the unique characteristics of WPS, the absence of automated firmware upgrades and mechanisms to safely configure and administer APs; these attacks pose a significant threat that require serious attention and countermeasures to provide safe management of APs and their policies.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682757","","Computational modeling;Educational institutions;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Protocols;Sociology;Statistics;Wireless communication","access protocols;cellular radio;computer network security;data privacy;firmware;wireless LAN","Boston;USA;WEP;WPS flaws;WPS protocol;WiFi AP infections;WiFi protected setup protocol;access points;automated firmware;cellular radio;denial of service attacks;epidemiological study;home internal networks;man-in-the-middle attacks;war-driving measurements;wired equivalent privacy","","0","","33","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposed an anomaly detection method using a simple Hide Markov Model to detect the abnormal network behaviors. We build a Hide Markov Model by supposing that all the network behaviors are completely normal.

Software applications frequently fail to identify so many signatures through comparisons at very high network speeds. Bloom filters are one of the main multi-hashing schemes utilized in hardware to support this level of security. Nevertheless Bloom filters consume significant power to store, retrieve and lookup virus signatures owing to many hash function computations required to index to the memory. We present a novel lookup technique and architecture to decrease the power consumption of multi-hashing schemes, predominantly Bloom filters, in hardware. The theoretical analysis has shown that power gain achieved through new lookup technique can go up to 90%. Simulation results with three different classes of the hash functions embedded into the Bloom filter have indicated that power consumption of the Bloom filters can be considerably decreased by employing the low power lookup technique","","0-7695-2533-4","","10.1109/ISVLSI.2006.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1602437","","Application software;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Power filters","computer networks;cryptography;digital filters;low-power electronics;table lookup;telecommunication security","Bloom filters;hash functions;low power lookup technique;multihashing network;multihashing schemes","","4","","10","","","2-3 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HMMs are applied to model the normal program behaviors using traces of system calls issued by processes. The output probability of a sequence of system calls is calculated by the normal model built. If the probability of a sequence in a trace is below a certain threshold, the sequence is flagged as a mismatch. If the ratio between the mismatches and all the sequences in a trace exceeds another threshold, the trace is then considered as a possible intrusion.

Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated through emulations in Mininet.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838227","","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Control systems;IP networks;Measurement;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","application program interfaces;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management","Floodlight;Mininet;OpenFlow standard;PayLess framework;RESTful API;SDN;adaptive statistics collection algorithm;aggregate statistics collection;application program interfaces;communication interfaces;control plane;data plane;flow control;flow level statistics collection mechanism;network management tasks;pull-based service;software defined networking;statistics collection mechanism","","14","","28","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection of network attacks utilizes a highspeed pattern matching algorithm that can be implemented in either hardware or software. Adapting a software-based pattern matching algorithm to hardware-based device is a complicated task. This paper presents a cost effective multi-pattern matching algorithm based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and standard RAM. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed, which is several orders of magnitude faster than the current state of the art, while attaining similar accuracy of detection. The algorithm can be easily adapted to operate in hardware-based NIPS and attain even higher speed by utilizing a TCAM memory.","","1-4244-1206-4","1-4244-1206-4","10.1109/HPSR.2007.4281234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4281234","","Costs;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Home appliances;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;random-access storage;security of data;telecommunication security","RAM;field programmable gate array;multipattern matching algorithm;network intrusion prevention system;random access storage;software-based pattern matching","","1","","22","","","May 30 2007-June 1 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most network security techniques employed by the IDS and IPS depend mainly on packet behavior for detection. This work applies a quantitative approach based on Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) detection rules with the hope of reducing the high false positive and false negative rates. The entire system has been represented by a mathematical model of a discrete binary communication channel having two possible input messages and two possible output symbols. The network under study is assumed to have only one entry point (sender) for now, with a number of nodes (receivers). Also, all normal operational packets are referred to as normal packets and any other packets are referred to as abnormal packets. The analysis strategy used here is anomaly detection. The developed algorithm initially calculates the a priori probabilities for the normal and abnormal packets both at the sender and entry ends. These values are further used in finding the threshold probabilities to be compared to the corresponding probabilities of future incoming packets. MATLAB was used in coding the developed algorithm. This work will be expanded by modeling the entire system as a continuous binary communication channel and also by considering multiple entry points as future works, with the intension of improving the results obtained so far.","","978-1-4244-1109-2","978-1-4244-1110-8","10.1109/ISCE.2007.4382164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4382164","","Communication channels;Communication system security;Communication systems;Communications technology;Data security;Estimation theory;Failure analysis;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Signal detection","computer networks;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security","anomaly detection;continuous binary communication channel;discrete binary communication channel;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention systems;maximum a posteriori detection rule;network security;signal detection;signal estimation","","0","","9","","","20-23 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization of resources allows jobs to be run on remote resources participating in a grid. While this computing paradigm has been used primarily for batch jobs, we study interactive grid applications rich in graphics and multimedia such as scientific visualization and digital content creation. A host of security issues need to be addressed for such interactive grids to gain acceptance, particularly in industry. The purpose of this paper is to study these security issues. The grid security infrastructure (GSI), a component of the Globus Toolkit (I. Foster et al., 1997), creates grid credentials for every user and resource. We describe how this may be extended to securely set up an interactive session on a remote host, and the additional security issues associated with interactive session management. We propose controlled shell and controlled desktop mechanisms that restrict the user to execute only authorized commands and applications, and controlled user and super-user accounts that customize the shell and desktop using policy files. We also propose a new approach to scoping the security needs of grid systems by defining three generic scenarios: mutual trust, partial trust and mutual distrust. New security issues arise when the user may not be trusted, or the user and the host computer's owner are mutually suspicious.","","0-7803-8104-1","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1291937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291937","","Application virtualization;Authentication;Computer security;Data security;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Multimedia computing;Resource management;Resource virtualization;Visualization","data visualisation;grid computing;interactive systems;multimedia computing;security of data","Globus Toolkit;controlled desktop mechanism;controlled shell mechanism;digital content creation;geographically distributed computing resources;graphics;grid computing;grid security infrastructure;interactive grid;interactive session management;multimedia;multiple administrative domain;resource sharing;scientific visualization;security issues","","2","1","27","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20090626","2009","","","90","96","To accommodate the information security growth and hacker's improved strategies and tools, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are required to be allocated across the network. Furthermore, previous studies showed that the choice of network features used for the IDS is dependent on the type of the attack. Accordingly, each TCP/IP network layer has specific type of network attacks, which means that each TCP/IP network layer needs a specific type of IDS. This paper proposes a new categorization for IDS depending on the TCP/IP network model: application layer IDS (AIDS), transport layer IDS (TIDS), network layer IDS (NIDS) and link layer IDS (LIDS). Each of these IDS types is specialized to a specific network device. So, the detection process will be distributed among all TCP/IP network model layers through the network devices. To design each of these different types of IDS, several experiments have been conducted using two different features selection approaches to select the appropriate features set for each IDS type. The experimental results indicate that each IDS type has different features set that can not only improve the overall performance of the IDS, but it also can improve its scalability.","","978-1-4244-3999-7","978-0-7695-3639-2","10.1109/WAINA.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136630","Intrusion detection systems;TCP/IP network model;features ranking;features selection;support vector decision function;support vector machines","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data processing;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Support vector machines;TCPIP","security of data;transport protocols","TCP/IP network layer;application layer;information security;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network allocation;network devices;transport layer","","1","","24","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model can be applied to not only mobile ad hoc networks but also wireless sensor networks. We define a new throughput characteristic function, on the basis of which nodes are enforced to cooperate and form coalitions. This function implies the maximal throughput and the most reliable traffic that a coalition can achieve. The fair payoff share inside the coalition is given by Shapley value after proving the feasibility of this method. Then a set of game rules is presented to establish a threatening mechanism to all players. We then describe the coalition formation procedure and explain how to integrate this game theoretic model with available wireless routing protocols. Finally, a theoretical analysis is conducted to illustrate the convergence situation and verify the correctness of the formulation.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698154","","Computer science;Computer security;Game theory;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","coalition formation procedure;coalitional game theoretic model;mobile ad hoc network;network traffic;routing protocol;threatening mechanism;wireless network security;wireless sensor network","","2","","19","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nonetheless, an ITM system can also become the target of attack. In this paper, we address localization attacks against ITM systems in which an attacker impairs the effectiveness of ITM systems by identifying the locations of ITM monitors. We propose an information-theoretic framework for the modeling of localization attacks as communication channels. Based on the information-theoretic model, we generalize all existing attacks as ldquotemporal attacksrdquo, derive closed formulae of their performance, and propose an effective detection approach. The information-theoretic model also inspires a new attack called a spatial attack and motivates the corresponding detection approach. We show simulation results that support our theoretic findings.","","978-1-4244-2397-2","978-1-4244-2398-9","10.1109/DSN.2008.4630104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4630104","Information theory;Internet threat monitoring systems;Localization attack","Communication channels;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer worms;IP networks;Information analysis;Internet;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;information theory;security of data","Internet threat monitors;distributed denial-of-service;information-theoretic framework;localization attacks","","1","","26","","","24-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
