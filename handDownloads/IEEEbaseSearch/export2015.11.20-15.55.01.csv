Current software-based IDS often fails to keep up with high-speed network links so a hardware based IDS is requested. This paper deals with design and implementation of complete hardware accelerated IDS solution based on field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Core generator for automatic mapping of IDS rules to FPGA logic was designed to assure fast packet classification and high speed pattern matching. Proposed architecture has been evaluated on a COMB06X card with FPGA Virtex-II Pro. Using COMB06X card theoretical throughput 6.4 Gbps was achieved for all Snort rules.

In such a system, once some nodes have been compromised, the attack would be directed by the network topology because compromise of a node may cause the compromise of its neighbors. Furthermore, the attack could be crafty or stealthy, meaning that it would always try not to trigger the intrusion detection alarm of the networked system. In such a setting, a question of particular interest to the system administrator is: What is the quantitative security assurance of the networked system? This problem is notoriously known to be difficult, and the state-of-the-art is that we know very little about it.

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598829","Cost minimization;dCMS;dLEARNIN;data fusion;pattern recognition for intrusion detection","Computer networks;Cost function;Error analysis;Humans;Information resources;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;sensor fusion","anomaly detection;cost minimization;data fusion;information fusion approach;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;misuse detection;pattern recognition algorithms","","8","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in SnortÂ¿s ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets.

In this paper, we present a protocol for detecting wormhole attacks without use of any special harware such as directional antenna and precise synchronised clock and the protocol is also independent of physical medium of wireless network. After the route discovery, source node initiates wormhole detection process in the established path which counts hop difference between the neighbours of the one hop away nodes in the route. The destination node detects the wormhole if the hop difference between neighbours of the nodes exceeds the acceptable level.

These services are made discoverable to the user in the form of simple abstractions via virtualized resources. These services offer unprecedented dynamic, primarily hardware dependent, scalability. Although CC promises to make life much easier for the user, it comes with significant security issues. Because on-demand service provisioning for applications and data will be used by hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of users simultaneously, a successful intrusion would not only expose sensitive data, but it could also completely cut users off from both applications and/or data. This paper examines the underlying security risks inherent to the CC paradigm, compares approaches to mitigate known security risks, and offers a solution that leverages intelligent multi-agent systems and network data ontologies to provide automated defense for both known and unknown malware security risks. We describe a mechanism whereby a dynamic ontology can be self-enriched over time to provide for some protection against unknown security risks.","0547-3578","978-1-4577-1040-7","","10.1109/NAECON.2011.6183074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6183074","Cloud Computing;dynamic ontology;intelligent multi-agent system","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Intelligent agents;Malware;Monitoring;Ontologies","cloud computing;invasive software;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);risk management","cloud computing security risk;dynamic ontology;intelligent multiagent system;intrusion;malware security risk;network data ontology;on-demand service provisioning;security risk protection;self-monitoring defensive scheme;virtualized resource","","3","","56","","","20-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeyfiles can increase a network's internal security without adversely affecting normal operations. The honeyfile system was tested by deploying it on a honeynet, where hackers' use of honeyfiles was observed. The use of honeynets to test a computer security device is also discussed.

Partitioning the pat-tern set into several subsets, each of which produces a small DFA, is a practical way to deflate the state explosion. In this paper, we propose a regex pattern grouping scheme based on a new DFA model called Pattern-Based DFA (P-DFA) which supports efficient pattern-based op-erations, such as insertion, deletion, and etc. By using these basic operations, one can easily measure the state explo-sion when combining a set of regex patterns into a single DFA. Based on the privilege, we develop regex grouping algorithms for mitigating the state explosion in parallel and sequential matching environments, respectively.

We have designed and successfully developed a lightweight and platform independent low cost file monitoring approach and tool for securing important files from modifications in Cloud environment. The tool solves the issue of tampering with important files from VM users even if the user is intelligent enough to exploit operating system specific vulnerabilities for getting elevated privileges to perform such operations. The tool is light weight and independent as it does not require any support for file signature management that requires hash databases for storage of file integrity, and can be applied to any platform and environment with minimal changes and support. The novelty of approach lies in storing the signature of the file contents which is utilized for integrity monitoring in the file itself. The implemented tool is taken into practice on a private Cloud and initial results have been verified, which shows that the scheme is efficient and can be applied as a utility tool over a fully functional cloud deployment.","","978-1-4673-5325-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470835","Cloud;Cloud insiders;File Integrity;File Signature;Hash;Integrity;Integrity Establishment;Integrity Monitoring;Intrusion Detection Systems;Outside attackers;Security;Signature","Cryptography;Monitoring","cloud computing;file organisation;security of data","VM user;cloud deployment;cloud environment;cloud infrastructure security;cloud resource security;file content signature;file integrity;file security;file signature management;hash database;integrity monitoring;lightweight centralized file monitoring approach;virtual machines","","1","","16","","","10-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We derive from the lifecycle characterizing the services deployed in an SDN, the parts of services the control of which may be delegated by the operator to external customers through dedicated application programming interfaces (API) located in the northbound interface (NBI).

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server.

This paper proposes the Primary-Secondary trust node placement algorithm (P-S algorithm) to identify the set of primary and secondary trust nodes to address the above issue. In case of faults, secondary trust nodes will be activated immediately to avoid the cost of identifying the alternative trust nodes during runtime. Comparisons between the original trust node placement and the proposed P-S algorithm are performed based on a network under different tolerant levels.

The local optimization strategy, cooling schedule, and evaluation function are discussed in details. A state-of-the-art selection table is proposed, which greatly reduces the evaluation operation. In order to validate the newly proposed algorithm, a kind of exhaustive searching is implemented, which can find global minima for comparison with the cost of long yet feasible execution time.

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7754-8","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496","","Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols","","","","1","","24","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","","978-1-4673-2433-5","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.","","","","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947","Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis","Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine","","0","","21","","","24-26 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the ""Search"" phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.","","978-0-7695-2858-9","","10.1109/ICNS.2007.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321","","Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system","","0","","15","","","19-25 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

However, the routinely produced analytical data from computer networks are usually of very huge in size. This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches.

In this paper, we show that by using a concept of urgent data, our system can shorten the response time for most 'urgent' queries while guarantee lower bandwidth consumption. We argue that monitoring data can be treated differently. Some data capture critical system events; the arrival of these data will significantly influence the monitoring reaction speed which is called urgent data. High speed urgent data collections can help system to react in real time when facing fatal errors. A cloud environment in production, MagicCube, is used as a test bed.

But with this ever developing cloud concept, problems are arising from this Â¿golden solutionÂ¿ in the enterprise arena. Preventing intruders from attacking the cloud infrastructure is the only realistic thing the staff, management and planners can foresee. Regardless of company size or volume and magnitude of the cloud, this paper explains how maneuver IT virtualization strategy could be used in responding to a denial of service attack. After picking up a grossly abnormal spike in inbound traffic, targeted applications could be immediately transferred to virtual machines hosted in another data center.

This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612","","Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network","","9","","26","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most anomaly detection approaches using MLP can detect novel real-time attacks, but still has high false alarm rates. Most attacks are composed of a series of anomaly events. These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron. This approach also exhibits a lower false alarm rate when detects novel attacks. The simulation tests are conducted using DARPA 1998 dataset. The experimental results are presented and compared in ROC curves, which can demonstrate that the proposed approach performs exceptionally in terms of both detection rate and false alarm rate","","0-7695-2528-8","","10.1109/ISDA.2006.253765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021817","","Cellular neural networks;Chaos;Collaborative work;Educational programs;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Leak detection;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Real time systems","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;chaotic neural network;false alarm;hybrid MLP-CNN;intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron;time-delayed attacks","","3","","22","","","16-18 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The monitoring crew will be responsible for identifying the anomaly within the aircraft and take necessary preventive actions. With the introduction of additional technology within the aircraft, mere human perception may not be sufficient to make a decision. In this research work, the authors explore the possibility of implementing a smart video surveillance system (SVSS) within the aircraft that is tuned towards detecting the behavioral anomaly within the aircraft. The SVSS will generate security triggers when it detects an anomaly within the aircraft.

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally. In presence of attacker security scheme always provides the secure path and through multipath routing the possibility of secure routing is enhanced. Simulation results and PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) values of each node clearly shows better network performance in case of security scheme in presence of Jamming attack.","2347-9337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012891","AOMDV;Attack;MANET;Routing;Security","Bandwidth;Jamming;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","jamming;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDR;enhanced security scheme;jamming attack;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing protocol AOMDV;network topology;packet delivery ratio;security design;unauthorized packets","","0","","8","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the fact that diversified networking technologies are implemented, the networks have become leaky. Hence networks are becoming more vulnerable and as a result attacks on networks are intensifying. Although firewalls and routers are deployed, they are not sufficient. Intrusion detection systems monitor and inspect the packets traversing over a network ensuring deep packet analysis. But as the attacks are becoming more and more sophisticated, IDS available today are unable to address challenges that surround different types of attacks, since they are designed to handle specific types of attacks only. It is evident that no single technique can guarantee protection against future attacks. Hence there is a need for integrated architecture which can provide robust protection against a complete spectrum of threats.

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can deliver satisfactory system performance with less network load.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356567","","Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Computer architecture;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis","security of data","DARPA dataset;attack tools;collaborative architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;network technologies;noncentral analyzer;one-level hierarchy dIDS;security","","3","","31","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If he is inside the home, this alarm alerts him to operate the fire extinguisher manually. If he is away he dials back to the home telephone number with an additional digit to trigger ON the fire extinguisher. By dialing further digits he can switch off selected electrical appliances which might have activated the fire. Also, an intruder detector circuit incorporated with the telephone automatically dials digits to reach a public emergency service and upon receiving the response the attachment unit extends a recorded voice message to the called end informing about the intrusion. As these are simple means of maintaining the home security they can easily be adopted to any environment. Alternatively, with cell phone installed in home for this purpose the above techniques are implemented. This design has more security concerns as a microcontroller checks password and allows the switching process of appliances to take place.

In this work, we propose an autonomous host-based intrusion detection system for detecting malicious sinking behavior. The proposed detection system maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross-layer features to define a routing behavior. For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed. Experiments based on simulation show that the proposed cross-layer approach aided by a combination of SVM and FDA performs significantly better than other existing approaches.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374416","Cross-layer design;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;routing attacks;sinking.","","ad hoc networks;radio networks;support vector machines;telecommunication security","Fisher discriminant analysis;MAC layer;autonomous host-based intrusion detection;cross-layer detection;malicious node behavior;malicious sinking behavior;packet drop ratio;security vulnerabilities;support vector machines;traffic density;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","28","","2010-01-08","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The impact of cyber-attacks is sometimes comparable to the impact of traditional military actions. However, the lack of understanding of the scope of attacks and how they operate could lead to unsuccessful protection mechanisms. We have analysed attacks targeting IT and business network, and Critical infrastructure, as a result we present four levels of visibility of attacks that need to be considered when designing or implementing security mechanisms.

The source of attacks, sometimes, comes from a single source or multiple sources that makes harder to an investigator to trace attackers back to their original computer. In order to make attacks more difficult to discover, sophisticated attackers could hide their original IP address by using spoofing techniques, or they can cover themselves by launching attacks behind the proxy. This paper provides a detection and IP traceback mechanism that be able to identify a source of DoS attacks in three different scenarios. By setting up the experiment, the experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to detect a computer that generates denial-of-service attacks, even these attacks are located behind a proxy.","","978-1-4799-3196-5","","10.1109/InfoSEEE.2014.6946246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6946246","Denial-of-Service Attacks;IP Traceback System","Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","IP networks;computer network security","DoS attacks tracing;IP traceback mechanism;IP traceback system;denial-of-service attacks tracing;network administrators;original IP address;sophisticated attackers","","0","","9","","","26-28 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Signature-based matching mechanisms require a completed analysis of attack patterns and the availability of knowledge detection beforehand. To cope with new attacks, IDS tools require to be continuously updated with the signature rules. In this paper, we present anomaly detection technique by using complex Gaussian coefficient to calculate the threshold for detecting unknown flooding attacks. The Network traffics are generated for three types of situations in the normal light traffic period, during the attacking period and in the heavy traffic period. The numbers of packets in time domain are transformed to complex Gaussian coefficient. The variances of the complex wavelet magnitude in each derivative level significantly describe network situation. This technique can be applied to detect unknown DDoS flooding patterns.","","978-1-4244-4656-8","978-1-4244-4657-5","10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5397552","Anomaly-based Detection;Network-based Intrusion Detection System","Computer crime;Data engineering;Data security;Electronic mail;Floods;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Gaussian processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DDoS flooding pattern;anomaly detection;complex Gaussian coefficient;complex wavelet magnitude;intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;packet header data;signature-based matching mechanism","","1","","6","","","8-10 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20050425","2005","","","450","454","Anomaly detection tools currently react to directed attacks during or shortly after they have occurred. Unfortunately, an attack that is detected after it has occurred is, in essence, a successful one. Advance warning of potential attacks could aid in their detection. Before an attack is launched the attacker often performs reconnaissance on the target host or network to learn its vulnerabilities. If malicious network reconnaissance can be detected and identified, it can serve as a warning of future attacks and may provide clues as to the identity of the attacker. This paper presents a novel technique for the automated detection of malicious network reconnaissance in a live network.","","0-7803-8865-8","","10.1109/SECON.2005.1423286","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423286","","Computer science;Intrusion detection;Marine technology;Monitoring;Network topology;Pattern matching;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Software testing;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;computer network management;invasive software;telecommunication security","advance warning;anomaly detection tools;automated detection;malicious reconnaissance;network security","","1","","17","","","8-10 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially in the virtual private network (VPN) topology, with the emergence of the tunneling, private routing and cipher technology in VPN, there are two embarrassments for the protection of the entire VPN topology. One is that internal services will be uncovered in the Internet by the tunneling, which can be compromised by attacking the client-side endpoint of a VPN tunnel. The other is that firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) could not completely analyze the network packet content because of the private routing and cipher technology. Based on the analysis of the VPN topology, we put forward the multi-layered correlative control (MLCC) mechanism. MLCC is a multi-layered security protection mechanism based on VPN gateway incorporating client end-point, firewall, IDS and internal services. There are three types of correlative technology introduced in MLCC, which are endpoint extending, component correlation and service engine. By their combination, MLCC can turn the VPN protection into a correlative and full model and improve the security of the VPN topology. Finally, the performance analysis based on our prototype is presented.","","0-7695-2927-5","","10.1109/NAS.2007.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286406","","Intrusion detection;Network topology;Performance analysis;Protection;Routing;Search engines;Security;Tunneling;Virtual private networks;Web and internet services","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;virtual private networks","Internet;cipher technology;firewall;intrusion detection system;multi layered correlative control mechanism;network topology research security;private routing;virtual private network","","1","","10","","","29-31 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing data mining classifiers can not detect and classify the novel class instances in real-time data stream mining problems like weather conditions, economical changes, astronomical, and intrusion detection etc, untill the classification models are trained with the labeled instances of the novel class. Arrival of a novel class in concept-drift occurs in data stream mining when new data introduce the new concept classes or remove the old ones. The proposed approach for incremental learning of concept drift considers mining, where the streaming data distributions change over time. It build a decision tree model from training dataset, which continuously updates so that the tree represents the most recent concept in data stream. The experiments on real benchmark data evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach in both detecting the novel class and classification accuracy with comparisons of traditional data mining classifiers.","","978-1-4673-1434-3","","10.1109/ICECE.2012.6471629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471629","Conpect drift;data stream mining;decision tree;incremental learning;novel class","Biological system modeling;Data mining;Data models;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Training","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);real-time systems","classification models;concept drifting data stream mining;data mining classifiers;decision tree classifier;incremental learning;novel class labeled instances;real-time data stream mining;streaming data distributions","","3","","25","","","20-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the common security mechanism only backup logs, it is not able to find out traces of intruders because the hacker who is able to intrudes the security mechanism of organization would try to alter logs or destroy important intrusion evidences making it impossible to preserve evidence using traditional log security strategies. Thus, logs are not considered as evidence to prove the damage. In that case, digital evidence lacks in terms of completeness which makes it difficult to perform computer forensics operations. In order to maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later forensic procedures and intrusion detection, the study applies concepts of steganography to logs forensics, for which even intrusion altered records will be kept as well. Comparing to traditional security strategies, this study proposes a better logging mechanism to ensure the completeness of logs. Furthermore, the study will assist in intrusion detection through alteration behavior, and help in forensic operations.","","978-1-4244-6948-2","","10.1109/FUTURETECH.2010.5482741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482741","","Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Forensics;Information security;Internet;Maintenance;Management training;Protection","computer forensics;data privacy;steganography;system monitoring","backup logs;computer forensics operation;computer log file forensics;data hiding;information security;intrusion investigation;logging mechanism;steganography;traditional log security strategy","","1","","8","","","21-23 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Defending against network-based attacks is a major focus area in the APOD (Application That Participate in Their Own Defense) project, which set out to develop technologies that increase an application's resilience against cyber attacks. This paper gives an overview of APOD's current set of network-level defenses. Specific network-based defense mechanisms are described first, followed by a discussion on how to use them in local defensive behavior. Defense strategies, which specify coordinated defensive behavior across a distributed system, are discussed next, followed by results from initial experimental evaluation.","","0-7695-1928-8","","10.1109/ISORC.2003.1199253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199253","","Adaptive systems;Bandwidth;Delay;Floods;Intelligent networks;Monitoring;Packaging;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;distributed processing;telecommunication security","APOD project;cyber defense;distributed system;local defensive behavior;network centric mechanism;network-level defense","","5","7","41","","","14-16 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
