"Scalable NIDS via Negative Pattern Matching and Exclusive Pattern Matching","Kai Zheng; Xin Zhang; Zhiping Cai; Wang, Z.; Baohua Yang","Res. Lab., IBM China, Beijing, China","INFOCOM, 2010 Proceedings IEEE","20100506","2010","","","1","9","In this paper, we identify the unique challenges in deploying parallelism on TCAM-based pattern matching for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSes). We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If compromised, these hosts may inject bogus data into the intrusion detection system to hide their activities or falsely accuse well-behaved nodes. Approaches to Byzantine fault tolerance involving voting are potentially applicable, but must address the fact that only nodes in particular topological locations at particular times are qualified to vote on whether an attack occurred. We examine these issues in the context of a prototype distributed detector for self-contained, in-band wormholes in OLSR networks. We propose an opportunistic voting algorithm and present test results from a 48-node testbed in which colluding attackers generate corroborating false accusations against pairs of innocent nodes. The results indicate that opportunistic voting can instantaneously suppress false accusations when the network topology and routes chosen by OLSR provide a sufficient number of nearby honest observers to outvote the attackers.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412993","","Computer networks;Delay;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Voting","ad hoc networks;computer networks;mobile radio;security of data","Byzantine fault tolerance;MANET;cooperative intrusion detection techniques;countering false accusations;inband wormholes detection;intrusion detection system;network intrusion sensors;network topology;opportunistic voting algorithm","","6","","25","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reduction in video hardware cost has made it more feasible for large scale camera deployment. However, the increased scale of camera deployment creates difficulties for humans to track people through the monitored space and to recognize important events as they happen in timely manner without human intervention. In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times. In addition, we have managed to deploy 35 camera streams on single GPU card running at 20 frames per second which results in scalability factor of 1.75 times vs. a server class PC. Indeed, we have also managed to maintain the video analytics accuracy at 100% for given test dataset, in this implementation of the system.","","978-1-4799-2208-6","","10.1109/SPC.2013.6735111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735111","CUDA;GPGPU;parallelization;streaming;video analytics;video surveillance system","Accuracy;Cameras;Central Processing Unit;Conferences;Graphics processing units;Process control;Streaming media","graphics processing units;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;security of data;video cameras;video streaming;video surveillance","CUDA;GPGPU;camera surveillance area;compute unified device architecture;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion detection system;large scale camera deployment;macroparallelization;microparallelization;multinode video analytics processing;people tracking;real-time multinode streaming;surveillance activity;video hardware cost reduction;video surveillance system","","0","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It identifies the challenges in deploying Wireless Mesh networks (WMNs) and focus on secure routing as one of the key challenges in deploying WMNs. In order to implement a secure routing system, various Artificial Immune System (AIS) models were analysed. These models have been used in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and computer security in the literature. In this paper, the authors propose to use Danger models to secure routing in WMNs. The first step in secure routing process is to identify and classify the network dangers and take necessary actions to overcome those dangers. For the classification task, we apply Self-organizing Maps (SOMs) as the classifier to classify the danger levels in WMNs. These identified danger conditions are further deployed as the warning signals for the design of secure routing protocol. The experimental results validate the proposal of applying the Danger Theory (DT) into security area and good performance is also reported by the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier.","","978-1-4244-1557-1","978-1-4244-1558-8","10.1109/ATNAC.2007.4665308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4665308","Antibody;Antigen;HumanImmune System (HIS);Self-organizing Maps (SOMs)","Artificial immune systems;Artificial neural networks;Communication system security;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Real time systems;Routing;Self organizing feature maps;Wireless mesh networks","artificial intelligence;neural nets;radio networks;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing","artificial neural network classifier;computer security;danger theory;intrusion detection system;routing security;self-organized classification;self-organizing maps;wireless mesh networks security","","0","","13","","","2-5 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new host-based intrusion detection approach, based on analyzing the behavior of the computer to detect the presence of unknown malicious code. The new approach consists on classification algorithms that learn from previous known malcode samples which enable the detection of an unknown malcode. We performed several experiments to evaluate our approach, focusing on computer worms being activated on several computer configurations while running several programs in order to simulate background activity.

In this paper we proposed a novel approach to predicting future attacks. First an attack graph is generated through data mining and the predictability of every attack scenario which represents how probable there would be oncoming attacks following the attack scenario can be estimated. Then in real-time intrusion detection environment the IDS alerts are correlated into attack scenarios and ranked by their predictability scores.

However, it may not be able to detect intrusions in real-time especially in networks with high traffic. This paper proposes a two layer framework where Snort will run as a second line of defense and will be executed only when deep payload analysis is needed. To accelerate the efficiency of Snort, the proposed system will dynamically offload the most frequent rules or signatures to a NetFPGA based hardware. The NetFPGA will work as a first line of defense that accelerates the detection by filtering all the traffic looking for intrusions. This will be done by analyzing the captured packet header to match the offloaded rules or signatures.","","","","10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923858","Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Engines;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Radiation detectors","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","NetFPGA based hardware;NetFPGA-based Snort NIDS;deep payload analysis;high-speed network intrusion detection system;malicious traffic detection;single threaded application;software-based NIDS","","0","","17","","","23-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed SPS uses the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) in order to detect attacks and filter malicious frames. The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead. The soundness of the proposed method is proved through both theoretical analysis, as well as experiments.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687997","","Computer security;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Privacy;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;computer network security","HAN;ZigBee based home area networks;attack prevention;dynamic threshold;malicious frames;novel spoofing prevention system;received signal strength;security center;smart grids;spoofing detection module;static threshold","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The work is deployed in the programmable routers in real time and the attack source detection mechanisms are carried out.

Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models. The proposed index policies apply to a more general case where a subset (more than one) of the components can be probed simultaneously. The problem under study also finds applications in spectrum scanning in cognitive radio networks and event detection in sensor networks.","1053-587X","","","10.1109/TSP.2014.2332982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844162","Anomaly localization;composite hypothesis testing;sequential hypothesis testing;sequential probability ratio test (SPRT)","Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Delays;Indexes;Optimization;Search problems;Testing","indexing;probability;reliability;resource allocation;security of data","anomalous components;anomaly localization;cognitive radio networks;event detection;optimal index policies;probing strategy;reliability constraints;resource-constrained cyber systems;sensor networks;spectrum scanning","","3","","32","","2014-06-25","Aug.15, 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks.

In this study, we identify the possibility of minimizing the expensive optical/electronic/optical (O/E/O) conversions for NFV chaining in packet/optical datacenters, which is introduced by the on-demand placement of vNFs. When the vNFs of the same NF chain are properly grouped into fewer pods, traffic flows can avoid unnecessary traversals in the optical domain. We formulate the problem of optimal vNF placement in binary integer programming (BIP), and propose an alternative efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this problem.

We then consider how defensive deceptions can be packaged within ""generic excuses"" that are more convincing to an attacker than isolated refusals to obey commands. We describe how the selection of the best generic excuses and excuse application times can be formulated with probabilities as an optimization problem and solved.

Confidentiality is the most important point of information security with respect to integrity and availability in cloud computing especially in financial, governmental and military usage. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) service increases the cloud's security level. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system. At the same time, users can also manage and monitor their own confidentiality by themselves.","","978-1-4673-5612-1","","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557202","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Authentication;Computational modeling;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Military computing;Monitoring","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;trusted computing;virtual machines","AdjointVM;circular chain VM protection model;cloud administrators;cloud computing security level;cloud providers;corporate areas;external threats;host-based IDS;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;information security;internal threats;intrusion detection system service;private areas;trusted computing;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees;virtual machine monitor-based IDS","","2","","16","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these documents do not provide much guidance about recognizing potential problems or about preventative measures. Even so, it is apparent that knowingly tolerating dishonesty or incompetence within the corporation is likely to be regarded as negligence. Most organizations today pay little attention to the inter-relationship between the Formal component, Technical component and Informal component. The Board and senior management of organizations tend to focus more on narrow aspects such as ISIIT management rather than on a comprehensive view. Deficiencies in any of these three components may result in unbalanced IS/IT security implementation. The objective of this study is to integrate the three components simultaneously throughout the IS/IT security implementation. The model of IS/IT security governance is a comprehensive conceptual framework because it emphasizes the two-way relationship between each of the components. In this study, a triangulated approach is adopted, data were collected in three phases, phase 1 is a website analysis, phase 2 is an interview and phase 3 is a mail survey. The interactions of three components, formal, technical and informal are significant in the IS/IT security governance model.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750242","Formal component;IT security governance;Technical component and Informal component component","Organizations;Quality of service;Security","corporate social responsibility;information technology;management information systems;organisational aspects;security of data","IS-IT security governance model;Website analysis;component interaction model;comprehensive framework;corporate governance;corporation place responsibility;formal components;informal components;information system;information technology;interview;mail survey;organizations;technical components;triangulated approach","","0","","32","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In communication systems buffering is commonly used to mitigate in real time multimedia applications at the expense of an additional delay. This method is therefore not suitable for control systems implemented over packet switched communication networks due to the additional delay which can make the system unstable. Hence, jitter modelling and management is necessary. This paper focuses on the development and experimental verification of a suitable jitter model for wireless and wired network bottlenecks. The effects of jitter are then investigated by quantifying the performance of a simulated Networked Control System (NCS).

We present a design and proof-of-concept implementation of a packet processing system that uses two security techniques to defend against potential attacks: a processing monitor is used to track operations on each processor core to detect attacks at the processing instruction level; an I/O monitor is used to track operations of the router to detect attacks at the protocol level.

It is difficult to prevent because DDoS attacker send spoofing packets to victim which makes the identification of the origin of attacks very difficult. A series of techniques have been studied such as pattern matching by learning the attack pattern and abnormal traffic detection. However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks. Moreover, the amount of traffic flowing through the Internet increase rapidly and thus packet analysis should be done within considerable amount of time. This paper proposes a scalable, real-time traffic pattern analysis based on genetic algorithm to detect and prevent DDoS attacks on Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure.

The danger model is built on a sensitive tissue(ST). The sensitive tissue consists of a population of sensitive cells(SCs) that are abstracted characteristics from a node of wireless sensor networks which are sensitive to attacks.

Based on our previous proposed TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) anomaly detection method, which can detect anomalies with high detection rate and low false positive rate, we develop an instance selection mechanism for TCM-KNN based on EFCM (Extended Fuzzy C-Means) clustering algorithm in this paper, aiming at limiting the size of training dataset, thus reducing the computational cost of TCM-KNN and boosting its detection performance.

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.","","978-0-7695-2847-2","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118","","Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server","Internet;cryptography","HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems","","5","1","23","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The adaptive algorithm runs a less secure protocol to reduce the communication overhead when there is no threat. The system adapts to a more secure but less efficient protocol when security threat is detected.

It needs to perform exact matching on multi-pattern signatures in real time. In this paper we introduce an efficient data structure called extended Bloom filter (EBF) and the corresponding algorithm to perform the multi-pattern signature matching. We also present a technique to support long signature matching so that we need only to maintain a limited number of supported signature lengths for the EBFs. We show that at reasonable hardware cost we can achieve very fast and almost time-deterministic exact matching for thousands of signatures.

First stage is the offline training process where the extracted features in the database is clustered using k-means clustering and then the second stage is the online testing where the obtained query image is compared with the clustered images and is classified as intruder or authenticated person based on the similarity measure.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972434","Block Independent Component Analysis (B-ICA);Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR);Face Recognition;K-means clustering","Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Training","content-based retrieval;face recognition;feature extraction;image retrieval;independent component analysis;pattern clustering","BICA-C;authenticated person;block independent component analysis;content based image retrieval;face detection;face recognition;image content;image database;image feature extraction;intruder;k-means clustering technique;offline training process;online testing;query image;semantically relevant image retrieval","","1","","11","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sleep deprivation attack is one of the most interesting attack in layer 2 where the attacker tries to use a low energy node until all its energy is exhausted and the node goes into permanent sleep. This attack is also possible in routing level. In OLSR low energy node declare their status through willingness property of HELLO message. Using this information an attacker node can choose that low energy node deliberately and forward all traffic through that node. This leads to low energy node in a permanent sleep mode.

First, we provide a simulation of MPEG-4 using OPNET over the WLANs in terms of throughput, impacts of multiple MPEG-4 streams, and compression rate on throughput. Our simulation results show that a higher throughput does not always yield a better quality MPEG-4 video. We further observe that if an I frame of MPEG 4 video is lost, the next N-1 frames (all P and B frames) are useless [where N is the total number of frames contained within one group of picture (GoP)]. Furthermore, we observe that the I, P, and B frames are in decreasing order of importance. Therefore, we propose a cross-layer approach to improve MPEG-4 trans missions over WLANs. In the proposed approach: 1) P and B frames will be discarded by the MPEG-4 decoder at the receiver's medium access control (MAC) layer if the corresponding I fame is lost; 2) the individual MPEG-4 frames are prioritized at the MAC layer so that I frames have a higher priority than P frames, which have a higher priority than the B frames; 3) each frame (I, B, P) has a time deadline field so that if the deadline cannot be reached, the frame and other related P and B frames in the same GoP are deleted without further transmissions/re-transmissions; and 4) if the delay between an I frame and the next P frame is too long, then it may be better to drop the least important B frames in an attempt to allow the video to catch up. Finally, we study MPEG-4 transmissions over the IEEE 802.11e WLANs, and we adopt a measurement admission control scheme for IEEE 802.lie.

In general, these network attacks can be detected by deploying network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) to the cloud platform.

This work presents a new architecture for building an efficient NIDS to the cloud virtualization environment. By resolving the virtual system information from operating systems' kernel map in hypervisor layer, the services in the cloud can be identified exactly and the required detection rules can be adopted dynamically.

IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks.

Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection may result. Feature ranking and selection, therefore, is an important issue in intrusion detection. We apply the technique of deleting one feature at a time to perform experiments on SVMs and neural networks to rank the importance of input features for the DARPA collected intrusion data. Important features for each of the 5 classes of intrusion patterns in the DARPA data are identified. It is shown that SVM-based and neural network based IDSs using a reduced number of features can deliver enhanced or comparable performance.

In our system, an independent intrusion detection system reports identified malicious tasks periodically. The recovery system detects all damage caused by the malicious tasks and automatically repairs the damage according to dependency relations. Without multiple versions of data objects, recovery tasks may be corrupted by executing normal tasks when we try to run damage analysis and normal tasks concurrently. We address the problem by introducing multiversion data objects to reduce unnecessary blocking of normal task execution and improve the performance of the whole system.

A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack. This system is designed to be integrated into other detectors in order to mitigate false positive rates so that this enriches the chances of detecting zero-day worms and new attack exploits","","1-4244-0997-7","1-4244-0997-7","10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156646","","Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Phase detection;Phase measurement;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis","IDS;Mahalanobis distance;clustering phase;false alarm rate;incremental learning algorithm;network anomaly detection system;network traffic;statistical model;value-byte frequency","","0","","15","","","22-24 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper proposes a solution to the above problem using an adaptive grammar generation algorithm. This method reduces the entropy among similar results given by different patterns. Immense customizability is the foremost advantage of this method. Existing grammars for new signatures can be combined into a single grammar easily rather than new grammars be generated from raw target strings. The paper, thus, looks to limit the detailed knowledge requirement for the design of signature detection procedures and in doing so re-use existing procedures which have been thoroughly debugged and tested.","","978-1-4673-0060-5","","10.1109/EMS.2011.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6131199","Deep Packet Inspection;Grammar;Pattern Matching;Regular Expressions","Educational institutions;Entropy;Grammar;Inspection;Pattern matching;Production;Protocols","grammars;pattern matching;security of data","DPI;DoS;IDS;adaptive grammar generation;adaptive pattern matching;deep packet inspection;denial of service;entropy;immense customizability;intrusion detection system;signature detection procedure","","0","","6","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","10","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Sci., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on","20110728","2011","","","1","5","Many network security applications in today's networks are based on deep packet inspection, checking not only the header portion but also the payload portion of a packet. For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The evaluation results show that our approach can reduce the number of state access in the DFA significantly.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5962596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962596","","Automata;Computers;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","computer network security;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA-based regular expression matching;Snort;compressed traffic;deep packet inspection;layer-7 filtering;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection system;rule sets;traffic monitoring","","1","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection has been studied for approximately 20 years. It is based on the beliefs that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user and that many unauthorized actions will be detectable. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are usually deployed along with other preventive security mechanisms, such as access control and authentication, as a second line of defense that protects information systems. There are several reasons that make intrusion detection a necessary part of the entire defense system. This paper describes various Intrusion Detection methods like pattern matching, state full pattern matching, protocol decode-based analysis etc and how fuzzy clustering can apply in IDS.","","","","10.1049/ic.2011.0085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193574","Fuzzy Clustering;Integrated Service Checker;Intrusion;Protocol Decode-Based Analysis","","authorisation;fuzzy set theory","IDS;access control;authentication;fuzzy clustering;information system;intrusion detection methods;intrusion detection systems;intrusion identification;preventive security mechanisms;security policy","","0","","","","","14-15 Nov. 2011","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

It is immense challenge for researcher to protect the mobile ad hoc network from the malicious node as topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious node can easily inject false routes into the network. A traditional method to detect such malicious nodes is to establish a base profile of normal network behavior and then identify a node's behavior to be anomalous if it deviates from the established profile. As the topology of a MANET constantly changes over time, the simple use of a static base profile is not efficient. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to detect the malicious node in MANET. In proposed method k-means clustering-based anomaly detection approach is used in which the profile is dynamically updated. The approach consists of three main phases: training, testing and updating. In training phase, the K-means clustering algorithm is used in order to establish a normal profile. In testing phase, check whether the current traffic of the node is normal or anomalous. If it is normal then update the normal profile otherwise isolate the malicious node and ignore that node from the network. To update the normal profile periodically, weighted coefficients and a forgetting equation is used.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155836","Dynamic Intrusion Detection System;K-means clustering;MANET","Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Testing;Training","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection approach;dynamic learning;intrusion detection approach;k-means clustering;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc network;network data;novel framework;security system;static base profile;surveillance system;topology node","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The work improves upon existing techniques, which only detect a limited set of attacks (based on measuring anomalies in the power levels of the Bluetooth device). The new method identifies reconnaissance, denial of service, and information theft attacks on Bluetooth enabled devices, using signatures of the attacks. Furthermore, this system includes an intrusion response component to detect attacks in progress, based on the attack classification.
