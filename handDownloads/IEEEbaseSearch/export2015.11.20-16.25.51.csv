Digital forensic analysis of intrusions using alerts generated by existing intrusion detection system (IDS) faces major challenges, especially for IDS deployed in large networks. In this paper, the concept of automatically sifting through a huge volume of alerts to distinguish the different stages of a DDoS attack is developed. The proposed novel framework is purpose-built to analyze multiple logs from the network for proactive forecast and timely detection of DDoS attacks, through a combined approach of Shannon-entropy concept and clustering algorithm of relevant feature variables. Experimental studies on a cyber-range simulation dataset from the project industrial partners show that the technique is able to distinguish precursor alerts for DDoS attacks, as well as the attack itself with a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 22.5%. Application of this technique greatly assists security experts in network analysis to combat DDoS attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116055","Shannon entropy;alert management;distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) detection;k-means clustering analysis;network security;online anomaly detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;digital forensics;entropy;forecasting theory;pattern clustering","DDoS attacks;FPR;IDS;Shannon-entropy concept;clustering algorithm;cyber-range simulation dataset;digital forensic analysis;distributed denial-of-service;entropy clustering approach;false positive rate;forecasting;intrusion detection system;network analysis;proactive forecast;project industrial partner;volume anomaly","","0","","32","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of them rely on sensors dedicated to local area networks or Internet. However clusters rely heavily on networks. Because of their uniformity, they are sensible to attacks: one compromised node can lead to the control of whole cluster. In order to solve such security issues, we purpose a NIDS architecture which addresses the same constraints as a cluster: efficiency, scalability and reliability. It is based on the cluster paradigm. We stress on the facts that network packets must be dispatched according to streams and analysis must be load-balanced at process level. Moreover two types of practical parallel analysis are presented, depending on the type of flows.

In this paper, to improve the accuracy and convergence rate, we use Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to refine the weight of SOM. SA algorithm find the optimal point by a form of probability, and it is proved that if enough time is given, the SA can certainly find the optimal point. The algorithm is divided into two steps: first, use traditional SOM algorithm to train samples; second, adjust the weight of excited neuron and its neighborhoods by SA algorithm.

The Android OS uses permissions to control access to software and hardware components of the device. Therefore, depending on the combination of permissions allowed by the user, a different set of hardware components will be used and hence a particular device may experience different battery consumption patterns depending on the set of allowed permissions. In this position paper we provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of the relation between some popular Android permissions and battery consumption by the device while these permissions are allowed. While battery consumption is an issue in different platforms, we chose to study this on Android because of the user's involvement in the Android permission model. We are hoping that these results will be the basis of further investigation into battery usage profiling of different Android applications based on the analysis of their permission requests and usage.","","","","10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266526","Android;Battery Exhaustion;Permission;power profiling;power rating","Androids;Batteries;Battery charge measurement;Humanoid robots;Power demand;Power measurement;Smart phones","Android (operating system);power consumption;security of data;smart phones","Android permissions;battery consumption patterns;battery usage profiling;power profiling;smart phones;tablet computer","","","","","","","27-29 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We begin by describing a methodology for benign traffic generation that combines payload pools (possibly culled from traces of live traffic) with application-specific automata to generate streams with representative characteristics. Next, we describe a methodology for malicious traffic generation, and techniques for integration with benign traffic to produce a range of realistic workload compositions. We realize our traffic generation framework in a tool we call Trident, and demonstrate its utility through a series of laboratory-based experiments using traces collected from our departmental border router, the DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data sets provided by Lincoln Lab, and a suite of malicious traffic modules that reproduce a broad range of attacks commonly seen in today's networks.

In this paper, we explore the viability and efficacy of a novel graph differential anomaly visualization (DAV) model in the area of network management. Our approach combines algorithmic graph analysis methods and visualization technologies by taking advantages from both computer and human intelligence. We focus on DAV at various levels, i.e., nodes, links and communities. Specifically, a novel community-based DAV scheme is proposed that can help understand the managed networks with a right balance of granularity and complexity. More importantly, the community-based DAV algorithm is less susceptible to network dynamics and high churn.

In particular, the analysis is focusing on the maximum sensing range in terms of azimuth angle, height, sensitivity level for indoor and outdoor implementation. With the help of IoT, sensor which detected motion on weak detection angle or signal could communicate through internet and get signal from nearby sensor for better detection signal. The WSN platform is developed using Octopus II sensor nodes while the microwave motion detector is HB100 which detect movement using Doppler effects. Octopus II will uplink all signal through internet and provide corresponding action of virtual fencing when intrusion detected. Results show maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit is decreasing as azimuth angle increasing. With high sensitivity level of virtual fence unit, the maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit is larger than the maximum sensing range of virtual fence unit at normal sensitivity level.

Unfortunately, this protocol is still vulnerable to the presence of malicious nodes. To detect malicious activities, taking into consideration network lifetime, we randomly select a set of nodes that will play the role of intrusion detection monitors. The selected nodes will monitor the behavior of regular nodes, MPRs, and CHs looking for abnormal activities such as the disruption of cluster head election. Our simulation results show that with 50% of monitors we can detect malicious activities with probability more than 70%.

However, less success has been encountered in mapping data intensive irregular applications such as graph analytics, relational databases, and machine learning. Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks. Experiments with a set of irregular data intensive CUDA applications executing on a cycle-level simulator show that DTBL achieves average 1.21x speedup over the original flat implementation and average 1.40x over the implementation with device-side kernel launches using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism.","","","","10.1145/2749469.2750393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284092","","Cognition;Context;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Organizations;Registers","graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming","1D-3D grid;BSP programming languages;CUDA dynamic parallelism;DTBL;GPU execution model;bulk synchronous parallel programming languages;cycle-level simulator;data intensive irregular applications;dynamic thread block launch;irregular data intensive CUDA applications;lightweight execution mechanism;lightweight thread block dynamic spawning;nested device-side kernel launching functionality","","","","","","","13-17 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Synchronized Co-migration of Virtual Machines for IDS Offloading in Clouds","Kourai, K.; Utsunomiya, H.","Dept. of Creative Inf., Kyushu Inst. of Technol., Fukuoka, Japan","Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom), 2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on","20140306","2013","1","","120","129","Since Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds contain many vulnerable virtual machines (VMs), intrusion detection systems (IDSes) should be run for all the VMs. IDS offloading is promising for this purpose because it allows IaaS providers to run IDSes in the outside of VMs without any cooperation of the users. However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host. In this paper, we propose VMCoupler for enabling co-migration of offloaded IDSes and their target VM. Our approach is running offloaded IDSes in a special VM called a guard VM, which can monitor the internals of the target VM using VM introspection. VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination. The migration processes of these two VMs are synchronized so that the target VM does not run without being monitored. We have confirmed that the overheads of kernel monitoring and co-migration were small.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2013.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753786","IaaS clouds;intrusion detection systems;migration;virtual machines","Bridges;Linux;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Ports (Computers);Switches;Synchronization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS offloading;IDSes;IaaS clouds;VM introspection;VMCoupler;guard VM;infrastructure-as-a-service;intrusion detection system;kernel monitoring;synchronized comigration;virtual machine","","2","","19","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The features of packet flows (such as the minimal packet inter-arrival time and the number of packets with non-zero options in TCP headers) are used frequently in determining the traffic type and applying security policies. However, the extraction of flow features is difficult due to the increasing line rates, a broad range of network protocols, and a variety of complex flow features. In this paper, we leverage the multi-core processors to speed up the feature extraction process. We design an open source parallel software tool, aiming for processing network packet flows in real-time. We implement the software in four different designs including serial, parallel, pipelined and hybrid architectures. We evaluate the performance of the parallel software tool through measurement experiments. Our experimental results show that each method increases the packet processing throughput by 5-7% in comparison with the previous method. And finally the implementation based on the hybrid architecture improves the packet processing performance by 19.3% than the implementation based on the serial architecture.","","978-1-4244-8133-0","","10.1109/NAS.2010.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575656","Flow feature extraction;multi-core processors;parallelism","Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Machine learning algorithms;Multicore processing;Payloads;Throughput","computer network security;feature extraction;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;parallel processing;parallel programming;performance evaluation;software tools;telecommunication traffic","high performance flow feature extraction;hybrid architecture;multicore processors;network applications;network protocols;network traffic;open source parallel software tool;packet flows;packet processing;performance evaluation;security policies;serial architecture","","6","","27","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ANCS 2006. ACM/IEEE Symposium on","20080725","2006","","","81","92","Modern deep packet inspection systems use regular expressions to define various patterns of interest in network data streams. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D<sup>2</sup>FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the content addressed delayed input DFA (CD<sup>2</sup>FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD<sup>2</sup>FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a ""content-less"" identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput. Specifically, we show that for an application using thousands of patterns defined by regular expressions, CD<sup>2</sup>FAs use as little as 10% of the space required by a conventional compressed DFA, and match the throughput of an uncompressed DFA.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579526","DFA;deep packet inspection;regular expressions","Added delay;Automata;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Information security;Inspection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Permission;Throughput","computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;grammars;storage management","content addressed delayed input;content addressing;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;expression representation;memory access;network applications;network data streams;regular expression parsing;state traversal process;table compression","","15","2","34","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to cryptography based protective techniques such as authentication and authorization, several defense measures, like Intrusion Detection and Tolerance, and tools are employed to protect networks thereby, making security a critical issue. Therefore, the need for defining, structuring, and quantifying security arises as a necessary first step towards measuring the effectiveness of security related deployments. This work proposes a structured approach to define and analyze security related metrics for intrusion tolerant systems for each individual host in the network and compose them in a meaningful way to provide an overall security quantification for a network. The dynamics of each machine against a particular vulnerability is modeled as a (hidden) Markov process to capture uncertainties in attacker's action and system response. Based on these stochastic analysis, security metrics of each machine are calculated which are subsequently used in the final computation of the security metrics of the network.","","978-1-4244-5487-7","","10.1109/COMSNETS.2010.5431978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431978","Markov process;Network security;hidded Markov model;intrusion detection system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probabilities;vulnerabilities","Application software;Authentication;Authorization;Computer networks;Cryptography;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Protection;Uncertainty","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;hidden Markov models;message authentication;probability;stochastic processes","computer network;cryptography based protective technique;hidden Markov process;intrusion detection;intrusion tolerant system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probability;stochastic analysis","","1","","15","","","5-9 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","2","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most background modeling methods fail in the presence of intensity changes, because the model cannot handle sudden changes. A solution to this problem is to use intensity-robust features. Despite the changes of an edge's shape and position among frames, edges are less sensitive than a pixel's intensity to illumination changes. Furthermore, background models in the presence of moving objects produce ghosts in the detected output, because high quality models require ideal backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a robust statistical edge-segment-based method for background modeling of non-ideal sequences. The proposed method learns the structure of the scene using the edges' behaviors through the use of kernel-density distributions. Moreover, it uses segment features to overcome the shape and position variations of the edges. Hence, the use of segments gives us local information of the scene, and that helps us to predict the objects and background precisely. Furthermore, we accumulate segments to build edge distributions, which allow us to perform unconstrained training and to overcome the ghost effect. In addition, the proposed method uses adaptive thresholding (in the segments) to detect the moving objects. Therefore, this approach increases the accuracy over previous methods, which use fixed thresholds.","1051-8215","","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2242551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423877","Background modeling;edge-segments;motion detection;object detection","Adaptation models;Image edge detection;Integrated circuit modeling;Kernel;Lighting;Robustness;Shape","edge detection;image segmentation;image sequences","background dynamism;background modeling;intensity changes;kernel-density distributions;nonideal sequences;statistical edge-segment distributions","","4","","33","","2013-01-30","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the most important components of a network management system to prevent attacks from paralysing the entire network. However, detecting the new type of attacks on a network system is a very difficult problem from the perspective of the classification mechanism of an IDS. This study presents an incremental network traffic classification algorithm called incremental particle swarm optimisation to enhance the performance of IDS. Based on semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation, the proposed algorithm is composed of two major phases: (i) the classification phase is employed to create the classifier for differentiating the type of network flows from the training dataset and (ii) the clustering phase is then used to classify the newly incoming patterns, which may contain known and unknown network flow types.","2047-4954","","","10.1049/iet-net.2012.0209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584858","","","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","IDS;classification phase;clustering phase;efficient network management method;high-quality network services;incremental network traffic classification algorithm;incremental particle swarm optimisation;intrusion detection system;network management system;semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"
"Training a neural-network based intrusion detector to recognize novel attacks","Lee, S.C.; Heinbuch, D.V.","Appl. Phys.

State-of-the-art IDS produce voluminous alerts, most false alarms, and function mainly by recognizing the signatures of known attacks so that novel attacks slip past them. Attempts have been made to create systems that recognize the signature of “normal,” in the hope that they will then detect attacks, known or novel. These systems are often confounded by the extreme variability of nominal behavior. The paper describes an experiment with an IDS composed of a hierarchy of neural networks (NN) that functions as a true anomaly detector. This result is achieved by monitoring selected areas of network behavior, such as protocols, that are predictable in advance. While this does not cover the entire attack space, a considerable number of attacks are carried out by violating the expectations of the protocol/operating system designer.

Traditional signature-based intrusion detection methods cannot find previously unknown attacks. On the other hand, algorithms used for anomaly detection often have black box qualities that are difficult to understand for people who are not algorithm experts. Rule extraction methods create interpretable rule sets that act as classifiers. They have mostly been combined with already labeled data sets. This paper aims to combine unsupervised anomaly detection with rule extraction techniques to create an online anomaly detection framework. Unsupervised anomaly detection uses diffusion maps and clustering for labeling an unknown data set. Rule sets are created using conjunctive rule extraction algorithm. This research suggests that the combination of machine learning methods and rule extraction is a feasible way to implement network intrusion detection that is meaningful to network administrators.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754981","Intrusion detection;anomaly detection;data mining;diffusion map;machine learning;n-gram;rule extraction","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Testing;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","black box qualities;classifier;clustering;conjunctive rule extraction;data set labeling;diffusion maps;information networks;machine learning methods;network intrusion detection;network security;online anomaly detection framework;unsupervised anomaly detection","","0","","32","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of recent approaches can not generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms in environments with noise. In this paper, we present a signature generation algorithm, namely CCSF (color coding signature finding), for polymorphic worms based on color coding. CCSF divides n sequences into m groups and each group contains 20 sequences. Firstly, CCSF generates signatures for each group by adopting color coding and filters them. Then all reserved signatures are clustered to get rid of redundant substrings. In this approach, signature can be generated without any fragment in environments with noise, and it can be used in IDS (intrusion detection system) to detect polymorphic worm. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiment results show distinct advantages in generating accurate signatures over other existed approaches.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198721","","Atherosclerosis;Character generation;Clustering algorithms;Colored noise;Communications Society;Computer worms;Information science;Intrusion detection;Noise generators;Working environment noise","invasive software","CCSF;automated signature generation approach;color coding signature finding;intrusion detection system;polymorphic worm;worm signatures","","1","","13","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect such sophisticated scans we propose the integration of algorithmic detection and visualization for human detection to simultaneously optimize computational complexity and human analyst time. The proposed approach provides real world detection capabilities without excessive computation overhead. We characterize the features of scanning attacks in a graph theory context, propose efficient graph algorithms to extract these features in real time, employ visualization techniques to show the relevant multidimensional characteristics, and provide test scenarios to show that the proposed work is more efficient and effective than previous approaches.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654827","","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Feature extraction;IP networks;Ports (Computers);Probes;Visualization","computer network security;graph theory","graph theory;sophisticated scanning attack;sophisticated stealthy network;visualization technique","","0","","9","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.","","","","10.1109/SRDS.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400","Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication","Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery","ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services","","0","","40","","","6-9 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We create a parallel version of standard Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) to determine free parameters of the SVM classifier and apply our proposed model to a content web spamming dataset, WEBSPAM-UK2011. Our implementation of the parallel PSO is constructed on a pool of threads and each thread executes tasks associated to a particle from the swarm. Experiments showed that our proposed model can achieve a higher accuracy than regular SVM and outperforms other classifiers (C4.5, Naive Bayes). Furthermore, parallel version of standard Particle Swam Optimization(PSO) can efficiently select parameters for SVM.","","978-1-4799-3731-8","","10.1109/AQTR.2014.6857840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857840","Particle Swarm Optimization;Support Vector Machine;parallelism;spam host","Accuracy;Kernel;Particle swarm optimization;Sensitivity;Standards;Support vector machines;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;Web sites;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;search engines;security of data;support vector machines;unsolicited e-mail","Internet;PSO;SVM;Web spamming dataset;particle swarm optimization;phishing;search engines;spam Websites;spam host classification;spam host detection;support vector machines","","0","","18","","","22-24 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is an unsatisfactory level of protection against abuse of cloud offerings at the moment. In this paper, we analyse the current state of abuse detection and prevention in IaaS cloud computing. To establish what constitutes abuse in an IaaS environment, a survey of acceptable use policies of cloud service providers was conducted. We have found that existing intrusion detection and prevention techniques are only of limited use in this environment due to the high level of control that users can exercise over their resources.

This paper first presents an Internet worm monitoring system. Then, based on the idea of ""detecting the trend, not the burst"" of monitored illegitimate traffic, we present a ""trend detection"" methodology to detect a worm at its early propagation stage by using Kalman filter estimation, which is robust to background noise in the monitored data. In addition, for uniform-scan worms such as Code Red, we can effectively predict the overall vulnerable population size, and estimate accurately how many computers are really infected in the global Internet based on the biased monitored data.

This knowledge is provided by network mapping tools. These tools rely on models to represent the entities of interest, and they leverage off network discovery techniques to populate the model structure with the data that is pertinent to a specific target network. Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit. The modeled information is managed by using a suite of composable network tools that can determine various aspects of network configurations through scanning techniques and heuristics.

DICAS uses as a fundamental building block the ability of a node to oversee its neighboring nodes communication. On top of DICAS, we build a secure routing protocol, LSR, which in addition supports multiple node-disjoint paths. We analyze the security guarantees of DICAS and use ns-2 simulations to show its effectiveness against three representative attacks.

This makes the network susceptible to Byzantyne faults with packets getting misrouted, corrupted or dropped. In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the ""detection manager"" to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks that contain malicious nodes indicate that unobtrusive monitoring has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate.","","0-7803-8104-1","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292276","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Fault detection;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","detection manager;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;security attacks;unobtrusive monitoring technique","","3","1","18","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes. Evaluation results show that a benign majority of nodes prevail over malicious attacking nodes as they are able to accurately classify network nodes based on reputation estimations.","","978-1-4244-4155-6","978-0-7695-3649-1","10.1109/CNSR.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4939153","Computer Network Security;Cooperative Systems;Mobile Communication","Communication networks;Communication system security;Computer graphics;Cryptography;Data security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Uncertainty","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","cooperative intrusion detection;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;network nodes;network reliability;network security;reputation exchange;trust evaluation","","5","","17","","","11-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a novel exploration in addressing these problems from a survivable, inescapable and deployable point of view.","","978-1-4244-8335-8","978-0-7695-4214-0","10.1109/HPCC.2010.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587281","Alert fusion;Cache-based mechanism;Target oriented policy","","security of data;sensor fusion","Australian Honey-Pot;CAFS scheme;alert fusion mechanism;cache-based alert fusion scheme;intrusion alert fusion system;intrusion detection system","","4","","28","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, given that voice communication is time sensitive and uses a suite of interacting protocols, VoIP exposes new forms of vulnerabilities to malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a highly-needed VoIP intrusion detection system. Our approach is novel in that, it utilizes not only the state machines of network protocols but also the interaction among them for intrusion detection. This detection approach is particularly suited for protecting VoIP applications, in which a melange of protocols are involved to provide IP telephony services. Based on tracking deviations from interacting protocol state machines, our solution shows promising detection characteristics and low runtime impact on the perceived quality of voice streams","","0-7695-2607-1","","10.1109/DSN.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1633528","","Application software;Computer science;Educational institutions;IP networks;Information systems;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Transport protocols","Internet telephony;computer crime;finite state machines;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP telephony services;Internet traffic;VoIP intrusion detection;interacting protocol state machines;malicious attacks;voice over Internet protocol","","28","1","21","","","25-28 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The advent of the computer networks has accelerated this development, and has sparked the emergence of the numerous environments that enable Web services. However, the computer network security against the distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) attacks attracts more attentions. The overwhelming alerts generated by the intrusion detection systems make it hard for the security administrator to analyze and extract the attack strategies, which hampers the performance of the attack detection. One method to resolve the problem is the attack scenarios extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel way to correlate the alerts and extract the attack scenarios. The modified case grammar, principal-subordinate consequence tagging case grammar and the alert semantic network, are used to generate the attack classes. Alerts mutual information is also applied to calculate the alert semantic context window size. Afterwards, based on the alert context, the attack instances are extracted.","","0-7803-8836-4","","10.1109/IPOM.2004.1547600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1547600","alerts correlation;intrusion detection;mutual information;network security;web services","Acceleration;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Performance analysis;Tagging;Web services","Internet;security of data;semantic networks","Web service network security;alert semantic context window size;attack strategy extraction;computer network security;distributed denial of service attacks;distributed services;intrusion detection systems;modified case grammar;principal-subordinate consequence tagging case grammar;security administrator;semantic scheme","","0","","12","","","11-13 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current solutions using software become inefficient running on high speed high volume networks and will end up dropping packets. Hardware solutions are available and result in much higher efficiency but present problems such as flexibility and cost. Our proposed system uses a modified version of Snort, a robust widely deployed open-sourced NIDS. It has been found that Snort spends at least 30%-60% of its processing time doing pattern matching. Our proposed system runs Snort in software until it gets to the pattern matching function and then offloads that processing to the field programmable gate array (FPGA). The software can then go on to other processing while it waits for the results from the FPGA. The hardware is able to process data at upto 1.7 GB/s on one Xilinx XC2VP100 FPGA. The design is scaleable and will allow for multiple FPGAs to be used in parallel to increase the processing speed even further.","","978-1-4244-1472-7","978-1-4244-1472-7","10.1109/FPT.2007.4439273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4439273","","Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Pattern matching;Payloads;Performance analysis;Quality of service;Robustness;Software architecture","field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;pattern matching;quality of service;security of data","Xilinx XC2VP100;field programmable gate array;high speed networks;high volume networks;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching;quality of service;software-hardware system","","2","","23","","","12-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. This approach will be used to set the rules for Backtracking to determine the intrusion characteristics then to implement the “ Deny All except allowed” policy rules for prevention. Combination of stream processing and backtracking is used to achieve this so-called Intrusion Prevention, so that in addition to detecting the existence of intrusion we do deny of intrusion as prevention.","","978-1-4577-1545-7","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2012.6188773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6188773","Data Stream;Frequent pattern mining;Intrusion Prevention","Analytical models;Maintenance engineering;Real time systems","computer network security;data mining","anomaly intrusion prevention system;backtracking rule;contemporary intrusion detection system;data source;high speed processing;intrusion characteristics;massive stream data processing;network model;online frequent item sets mining;prevention policy rule;stream data mining;time-sensitive sliding window;variable arrival rate","","0","","16","","","15-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.

Although Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have appealing features (e.g., low installation cost, unattended network operation), due to the lack of a physical line of defense (i.e., there are no gateways or switches to monitor the information flow), the security of such networks is a big concern, especially for the applications where confidentiality has prime importance. Therefore, in order to operate WSNs in a secure way, any kind of intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network (i.e., sensor nodes) and/or information destination (i.e., data sink or base station). In this article, a survey of the state-of-the-art in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that are proposed for WSNs is presented. Firstly, detailed information about IDSs is provided.

It preludes with several other attacks' attempts namely DeAuthentication, packet sniffing (airodump) and finally aircrack. The successful of a brute force attack is so determined by these attempts. This study will analyze DeAuthentication attack traffic pattern, sniffing and aircrack activity and propose two mitigation techniques which are 1) increase beacon time interval 2) mapping user's MAC address. Experimental result shows that deployment of mitigation techniques is efficient to stop these activities and mitigate the brute force attack.","","","","10.1109/ICCST.2014.7045190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045190","Brute Force Attack;Mitigation;Profiling;Wireless LAN","Communication system security;Computers;Force;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Scientific computing;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","computer network security;wireless LAN","MAC address;aircrack activity;airodump;beacon time interval;brute force attack mitigation;cyber attack;deauthentication attack traffic pattern;home wireless LAN;packet sniffing;wireless LAN WPA-WPA2 password","","0","","15","","","27-28 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under such strategy, IDSs may not realize the flexible detection according to different states of network security. Based on the immune principle of antigen presenting, this paper proposes a mechanism of Abnormity Presenting and Abnormity Triggering, which means detecting only when need. Once any abnormal event captured, ID system generates corresponding detectors, which discards the traditional manner to generate detectors blindly and randomly. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed schemes can realize the flexible detection.","","978-0-7695-2909-7","","10.1109/SNPD.2007.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287528","","Costing;Detectors;Equations;Event detection;Immune system;Information security;Intrusion detection;Proteins;Software engineering;Sun","computer networks;telecommunication security","IDS;abnormity presenting mechanism;abnormity triggering mechanism;antigen presenting principle;intrusion detection system;network security","","0","","11","","","July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one solution to encounter such problems. But IDSes are unable to reactive efficiently in encrypted accesses with encryption protocols, because they can not check the contents of a packet. This paper presents a new approach to detect anomaly behaviors in encrypted accesses with SSH2 protocol to network public servers such as http servers, ftp servers and database servers. In this approach, first the system extracts information from each SSH client, which is consist of transferred data size and time interval between messages. Second, the various actions are identified based on similarity of information. Finally, attacks are detected according to intrusion signatures, generated from the frequency of accesses and specifications of TCP traffic. This system dose not decipher private information, because it detect intrusion only by use of transferred data size and time interval between messages and does not require too many calculations, which are needed in common encrypted traffic analysis methods, before start operation. We show that this system is able to detect various attacks with a high accuracy, by implementing our proposed system on the Snort intrusion detection software and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4244-1691-2","978-1-4244-1692-9","10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4580619","","Access protocols;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data security;Databases;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","cryptography;feature extraction;network servers;security of data;transport protocols","DARPA evaluation dataset;SSH protocol;Snort intrusion detection software;TCP traffic;database servers;decipher private information;encrypted accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;encryption protocols;http servers, ftp servers;intrusion signatures;network public servers","","3","","18","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Combining Similarity and Dissimilarity: a Novel Approach for the Anomaly Intrusion Detection","Derhab, Abdelouahid; Bouras, Abdelghani","","WIAR '2012; National Workshop on Information Assurance Research; Proceedings of","20120618","2012","","","1","6","In this paper, we study the anomaly detection problem with the goal of minimizing memory and time complexity. Prior works need to check the whole training database to detect anomalous objects, and hence they are not scalable for large training databases. In this paper, we propose two similarity (resp., dissimilarity) measures. We show that similarity and dissimilarity can be described by one linear equation. Based on this result, we take a novel approach to address the anomalybased intrusion detection. This approach converts all the profiles composing the training database into 2-dimensional geometric points such that these points lie on the the same line y = n-x. A simple comparison operation is sufficient to decide whether an object is normal or anomalous. Complexity analysis shows that our IDS outperforms the classical anomaly-based IDS in terms of memory and time complexity.","","978-3-8007-3432-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6210575","","Atomic measurements;Complexity theory;Databases;Intrusion detection;Testing;Timing","","","","0","","","","","18-18 April 2012","","VDE","VDE Conference Publications"

However, there are some new security issues faced by VoIP protocols. Using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as VoIP signaling protocol is introduced issues called signaling attacks. In this paper, we proposed a lightweight mechanism to protect SIP-based VoIP from signaling attacks by introducing an additional header field and a method to protect some important header fields such as Proxy-Authorization, To and Call-ID which are targeted to the attacks. The proposed mechanism protects against SIP messages forgery and modifying SIP messages. The experimental results show that the average registration response time of SIPE-SAP is not much different than normal SIP registration. In addition, the SIPE-SAP call setup overhead is less than TLS.","2165-8528","978-1-4673-1377-3","978-1-4673-1376-6","10.1109/ICUFN.2012.6261715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261715","SIP;Session Initiation Protocol;Signaling attack;TLS;VoIP","Authentication;Cryptography;Protocols;Registers;Servers;Time factors","Internet telephony;signalling protocols;telecommunication security","Call-ID;SIP extension;SIP messages;SIP-based VoIP;SIPE-SAP;VoIP protocols;lightweight mechanism;proxy-authorization;security issues;session initiation protocol;signaling attacks protection;voice over internet protocol","","0","","16","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method uses two-stage matching: In the first stage, a hardware filter quickly scans the text to find partial matches, and in the second stage, the MPU scans the text to find a total match in the ClamAV 514,287 virus pattern set. To make the hardware filter simple, we use a finite-input memory machine (FIMM). To reduce the memory size of the FIMM, we introduce the parallel sieve method. The proposed method is memorybased, so it is quickly reconfigurable and dissipates lower power than a TCAM-based method. The system is implemented on the Stratix III FPGA with three off-chip SRAMs and an SDRAM, where all ClamAV 514,287 virus patterns are stored. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves 1.41-31.36 times more efficient area-throughput ratio.","","978-0-7695-3782-5","","10.1109/DSD.2009.208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350088","FPGA;Network;Reconfigurable Architecture;Virus Scanning","Field programmable gate arrays;Filters;Hardware;Internet;Pattern matching;Physical layer;Power dissipation;Random access memory;Search engines;Throughput","DRAM chips;SRAM chips;computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays","SDRAM;Stratix III FPGA;TCAM-based method;finite-input memory machine;hardware filter;intrusion detection system;off-chip SRAM;parallel sieve method;two-stage matching;virus scanning engine","","3","","24","","","27-29 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once authenticated and associated, the user can freely move around within the coverage area of the access point without losing data or network connection. On the negative side, these networks tend to have fuzzy boundaries, making it easy for an intruder to capture these transmission signals and also send massive volume of illegitimate traffic and utilize system resources in a way that renders the system inoperable thus denying access to authorized users.
