As the types and number of users of the internet increases, the requirement of an effective Intrusion Detection System(IDS) to detect these attacks also increases. Different techniques such as data mining and pattern recognition are being used to design IDS. One of the major challenges faced while designing IDSs is maximizing the accuracy of detection. To address this issue, this paper has used Ensemble of classifiers approach where each class uses different learning paradigm. The classifiers used for experimentation are Naive Bayesian(NB), Bayesian Network(BN), Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO), J48(C4.5) and Reduced Error Pruning Tree(REPTree).

Trust computations and management are highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the independent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches.

As a program runs, it uses the services of the underlying operating system to do some system calls. This system does not exactly need to know the program codes of each process. Normal and intrusive behaviors are collected with gathering the sequences of system calls for each process. Analysis of data is done via data mining and fuzzy techniques.

In this work we propose a cross-layer based routing attack detection system for ad hoc networks. Previous work that uses mostly audit trails collected from the routing protocol suffers from inadequacy of features to construct a reliable model for detecting anomalous routing behavior. On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CRADS is far superior than conventional protocol-specific detection systems.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-1997-5","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489304","","Ad hoc networks;Communications Society;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cross layer design;Data security;Detectors;Multimedia systems;Routing protocols;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security","CRADS;MANET;ad hoc networks;anomalous routing behavior detection;cross layer routing attack detection systems;cross-layer based routing attack detection system;data reduction;integrated cross layer;linear detectors;multiple protocols;nonlinear detector;nonlinear nature;routing protocol;support vector machine","","5","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, Weighted SVM considers different penalty parameters about class only and ignores importance among different samples. In this paper, we introduced class and sample weighted factors respectively and propose a new method, namely, Class and Sample Weighted C-Support Vector Machine (CSWC-SVM) to solve the problem.

We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this new family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller and comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected.

As more and more applications are encrypting the payloads and not to use well-known ports, traditional traffic classification methods such as transport-layer protocol ports based ones can not accurately and efficiently deal with these applications. In this paper we investigate the problem of classifing traffic flows into different application categories. And a new bag-of-words (BoW) model based traffic classification method is proposed, which has been widely used in document classification and computer vision. In the new traffic classification method the application categories of interests represents the bags, centroids represent the words of the BoW model, respectively. By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.","","978-1-4673-4942-0","978-1-4673-4940-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477666","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Out of order;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training;Vectors","Internet;computer vision;decision trees;document handling;pattern classification;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic","BoW model;C4.5 algorithm;Internet traffic classification;bag-of-words model;built-up vector;category representation vector;computer vision;cosine similarity;document classification;packet arrival sequence","","0","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, this study analyses SIP De- registration and call-disruption attacks and proposes a means of detecting these attacks. Attack detection is accomplished through a comparison of the messages last sent by the user and those that are considered to be an attack based on a Retransmission mechanism.

We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a ‚Äúuncompromised‚Äù router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment. Third, we present a statistical analysis module for the detection of TCP packet dropping attacks.

But as the network advanced, intrusions and misuses followed. Consequently, network security has come into issue. Now-a-days intrusion detection systems have become a standard component in security infrastructures. Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. And practically all of them require some kind of termination in network connections. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present PIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces most of the problems contained by the previous systems and it doesnpsilat need to terminate any network connections to detect the intruder. This system generates quick responses against intrusions and stops the intruder to proceed for further attacks.","","978-0-7695-3595-1","","10.1109/ICIME.2009.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5077011","Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion Prevention;Network Connection Termination;Packet Behavior;Trust Issue","Centralized control;Computer science;Control systems;Humans;Information management;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Real time systems","computer networks;security of data","PIDS;computer networks;global connectivity;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection;network intrusion prevention;network security","","1","","10","","","3-5 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To mitigate extra load caused by renewing of certificates, we have identified critical factors affecting it and designed the computation formula for optimal amount of cross certificates issued by trusted authority. To further improve the service reachablity in highly mobile networks in earlier stages of PKI deployment, we have designed the Cluster Glue. The Cluster Glue helps to connect groups of nodes from different parts of network which owns the certificates issued by the same authority.

The objective of key management is to dynamically establish and maintain secure channels among communicating nodes. Desired features of key management in sensor networks include energy awareness, localized impact of attacks, and scaling to a large number of nodes. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing acceptable levels of security and conserving scarce resources, in particular energy, needed for network operations. Many schemes, referred to as static schemes, have adopted the principle of key predistribution with the underlying assumption of a relatively static short-lived network (node replenishments are rare, and keys outlive the network). An emerging class of schemes, dynamic key management schemes, assumes long-lived networks with more frequent addition of new nodes, thus requiring network rekeying for sustained security and survivability. In this article we present a classification of key management schemes in sensor networks delineating their similarities and differences. We also describe a novel dynamic key management scheme, localized combinatorial keying (LOCK), and compare its security and performance with a representative static key management scheme. Finally, we outline future research directions.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2006.1632659","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632659","","Collaboration;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Large-scale systems;Network servers;Polynomials;Proposals;Resilience;Scalability;Sensor phenomena and characterization","cryptography;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","dynamic key management;localized combinatorial keying;long-lived networks;sensor networks;static short-lived network","","52","","12","","","April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed work contributes to the problem of securing data forwarding in the network layer; this is accomplished through exploiting the redundancy of multi-path routing for forwarding data packets. To maximise the possibility of successful delivery to a destination, each node generates a table with a reliability index for each of its neighbour without performing neighbourspsila monitoring; based on that reliability value, sending/receiving traffic is prioritised. This work evaluates the effectiveness of REliable and Efficient Forwarding (REEF) using the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA), REEF-IDA; the conducted simulation shows that REEF-IDA outperforms REEF in which it increases the throughput of the network while it decreases both end-to-end delays and packet loss ratio.","","978-9927-486-02-0","978-9927-486-03-7","10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669844","Ad hoc networks;cross layering;information dispersal;mobility;network layer;packet forwarding;priority queuing;security","Data security;Dispersion;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Redundancy;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data forwarding security;end-to-end delays;information dispersal algorithm;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath routing;neighbour monitoring;packet forwarding enhancement;packet loss ratio;reliability index;reliable-efficient forwarding;security research field;sending-receiving traffic","","0","","31","","","8-10 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies and notifies other nodes in the network to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. Numerous schemes have been proposed for intrusion detection and response systems, for ad hoc networks. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. In this paper, we examine the vulnerabilities of wireless networks and argue that we must include intrusion detection in the security architecture for mobile computing environment. We propose a mIDS (mobile intrusion detection system) suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, which detects nodes misbehavior, anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. mIDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes. Simple rules are designed to identify the misbehavior nodes. Theproess of identyfing the misbehavior node is carried out by a special node called a monitor node. Periodically monitor node is identified in the network.","","978-0-7695-3126-7","","10.1109/ISA.2008.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511525",": IDS;CDMA;DoS;QoS;TDMA;mIDS","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Availability;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Protection;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;cryptography;mobile computing;packet radio networks;telecommunication security","authentication;encryption software;firewalls;mobile computing environment;mobile intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;packet transmissions;response systems;security services;wireless networks","","3","","21","","","24-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By a secret sharing scheme, a secret message can be divided into multiple shares; then by multipath routing, the shares can be delivered to the destination via multiple paths. Improved security is expected because an adversary (adversaries) will have more difficulty in collecting enough shares to compromise the secret message. As the broadcast wireless channel of a MANET has a significant impact on the performance of multipath routing, we examine the performance of SPREAD based on the shared single wireless channel model by simulation.

Industry demands effective protection of assets while reducing the susceptibility of detection systems to unnecessary activation. Hence both the likelihood of intruder detection and the likelihood of unwanted alarm rejection need to be maximised to ensure quality performance leading to effective and efficient asset protection. To provide an indication of different volumetric motion sensing technologies' strengths and weaknesses in these areas, investigation has been made into the performances of dual and quad element passive infrared, and dual technology passive infrared/microwave sensors. This was accomplished by practical testing, with theoretical analyses of the outcomes before comparison of specific detectors to allow interpretations about each technology type. Some interpretations do not agree with outcomes predicted from theory or common views within the electronic security industry.

The commonly deployed security devices are firewall, IDS, IPS, anti-virus etc. Potential number of threats is still pervading which are formulated as attacks by combining many unnoticed primitive events. The best solution is to install a Complex Event Processing (CEP) system which can analyze multiple devices to infer attack patterns. Log information of network devices is the best choice for analysis. In a large network, there will be millions of events logged. Correlated analysis of this huge volume of log is the main challenge in Complex Event Processing (CEP) system. We describe a method to reduce the input to the Complex Event Processing (CEP) system, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

As the popularity of VoIP systems increases, they are being subjected to different kinds of intrusions some of which are specific to such systems and some of which follow a general pattern. VoIP systems pose several new challenges to intrusion detection system (IDS) designers. First, these systems employ multiple protocols for call management (e.g., SIP) and data delivery (e.g., RTP). Second, the systems are distributed in nature and employ distributed clients, servers and proxies. Third, the attacks to such systems span a large class, from denial of service to billing fraud attacks. Finally, the systems are heterogeneous and typically under several different administrative domains. In this paper, we propose the design of an intrusion detection system targeted to VoIP systems, called SCIDIVE (pronounced ""Skydive""). SCIDIVE is structured to detect different classes of intrusions, including, masquerading, denial of service, and media stream-based attacks. It can operate with both classes of protocols that compose VoIP systems - call management protocols (CMP), e.g., SIP, and media delivery protocols (MDP), e.g., RTP. SCIDIVE proposes two abstractions for VoIP IDS - stateful detection and cross-protocol detection. Stateful detection denotes assembling state from multiple packets and using the aggregated state in the rule-matching engine. Cross protocol detection denotes matching rules that span multiple protocols. SCIDIVE is demonstrated on a sample VoIP system that comprises SIP clients and SIP proxy servers with RTP as the data delivery protocol. Four attack scenarios are created and the accuracy and the efficiency of the system evaluated with rules meant to catch these attacks.","","0-7695-2052-9","","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311913","","Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer networks;IP networks;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Streaming media;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet telephony;client-server systems;data communication;protocols;security of data","IP networks;SCIDIVE;SIP proxy servers;VoIP systems;billing fraud attacks;call management protocols;cross-protocol detection;data delivery;denial-of-service intrusion;intrusion detection;masquerading intrusion;media delivery protocols;media stream-based attacks;rule-matching engine;stateful detection;voice traffic transmition;voice-over-IP","","29","4","17","","","28 June-1 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This attack can be used to infiltrate the database of any web application that may lead to alteration of database or disclosing important information. Cross site scripting is one more attack in which attacker obfuscates the input given to the web application that may lead to changes in view of the web page. Three tier web applications can be categorized statically and dynamically for detecting and preventing these types of attacks.

IEEE","20060320","2005","","","3263","3268 Vol. 5","The current Department of Defense (DoD) satellite communications architecture relies heavily on point-to-point, circuit-based communications technology, which is an inherently inefficient use of bandwidth resources. The current Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Operations Iraqi (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF) demand a more efficient and scalable infrastructure to support warfighter transformation. To meet these emerging requirements, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) DoD teleport program office (TPO) is building an initial transformational net-centric architecture by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 with significant upgrades starling in FY 2006. The DoD teleport system provides the deployed warfighter access to the global information grid (GIG) by linking the space and ground segments through a worldwide, pre-positioned military and commercial satellite communications infrastructure. Through multiple radio frequency (RF) media (military and commercial bands), teleport provides inter-theater reach-back into the defense information systems network (DISN) and service command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems, as well as intra-theater communications support for tactical users. These interfaces enable the seamless, interoperable, and secure transport of command and control (C2), intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and mission critical information supporting warfighter global operations. The TPO net-centric teleport architecture converges all the voice, video, and data requirements into a single Internet protocol (IP)-based transport system, consisting of: satellite IP-based networking modems, a ""black"" convergence router suite, and a voice over IP (VoIP) gateway for unclassified voice. This architecture, combined with the global network operations (NetOps) construct, will enable significant bandwidth efficiencies for greater reach-hack and enhanced warfighting capabilities through dynamic bandwidth allocation req- ired for advanced capabilities such as unmanned aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. As part of the Department's transformation, the teleport net-centric and circuit-based architecture will exist in parallel for some time to enable a gradual transition by the deployed warfighter. This architecture will be implemented in two phases beginning with a limited-IP design at two sites in FYO5 followed by a worldwide implementation at all DoD teleport locations. This paper highlights the implementation and intended operations of the new, net-centric teleport.","","0-7803-9393-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1606159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1606159","","Bandwidth;Buildings;Circuits;Command and control systems;Information systems;Intelligent networks;Military communication;Military computing;Radio frequency;Satellite communication","IP networks;Internet telephony;bandwidth allocation;command and control systems;internetworking;military communication;modems;open systems;resource allocation;routing protocols;satellite communication;surveillance;telecommunication security;transport protocols","DISA;DISN;Defense Information Systems Agency;Department of Defense;GIG;GWOT;Global War on Terror;IP-based networking modem;ISR mission;NetOp;OEF;OIF;Operations Enduring Freedom;Operations Iraqi Freedom;TPO;VoIP gateway;bandwidth resource allocation;circuit-based communication technology;command-control system;commercial satellite communication;convergence router;defense information systems network;global information grid;global network operation;intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance;interoperability;intratheater communication;military satellite communication;multiple radio frequency;net-centric DoD teleport;teleport program office;transport security;voice over Internet protocol;warfighter transformation","","0","","","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method takes the features of the network connections as nodes of a scale-free model, then detects the clusters of the network and extracts the key nodes of the model. The extracted nodes can be used in the IDS to detect the existence of intrusions. The result shows that the detection rate of the method is almost 1 percent lower than that of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, but the efficiency is improved by 13 percent.

However, the findings obtained from an attack graph highly depend on the quality of modeling. In this paper, attack modeling based on Petri nets is extended and an approach based on hierarchical Colored Petri nets is provided.

People have become increasingly dependent on the Internet to perform various tasks. Networks require a system that protects against intrusion activities. Therefore, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been created. Subsequently, IDSs have become an important part of modern networks to detect suspicious attacks. Modern networks expand and operate at high speeds, which is why handling all network traffic without overlooking security issues is difficult for IDS that run on a single processor. In this paper, we proposed a shared memory design called Hybrid Multi-Pattern Algorithm (HMA) as extension of our previous work, multi-core based HMA. The experiments show that GPGPU based HMA performs better than multi-core based HMA. This finding proves that GPGPU-based HMA is robust and can function properly in a high-speed network.","","978-1-4799-5685-2","","10.1109/ICCSCE.2014.7072704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7072704","GPGPU;High speed network;Hybrid multi-pattern algorithm;Intrusion detection system;Pattern matching","Computers;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Payloads","computer network security;graphics processing units;pattern matching;shared memory systems","GPGPU based hybrid multipattern algorithm design;GPGPU-based HMA;IDS;high-speed intrusion detection system;high-speed network;intrusion detection systems;network traffic handling;shared memory design;suspicious attack detection","","0","","23","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three particular scenarios are highlighted, which showcase this need. When using supervised Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), these systems need labelled datasets to be trained. Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection. The GA has been implemented to automatically provide the set of metrics that generate the most appropriate intrusion detection results.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956736","Automatic Labelling;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Network Traffic Labelling;Unsupervised Anomaly IDS","Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Measurement;Telecommunication traffic","digital forensics;feature selection;genetic algorithms","GA based approach;automatic dataset labelling;feature selection;genetic algorithm;labelled network traffic dataset;offline forensic analysis;real-time implementation;supervised intrusion detection systems;unlabelled dataset;unsupervised anomaly based IDS","","1","","13","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Mechanism Design-Based Multi-Leader Election Scheme for Intrusion Detection in MANET","Mohammed, N.; Otrok, H.; Lingyu Wang; Debbabi, M.; Bhattacharya, P.","Concordia Univ., Montreal","Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2008. WCNC 2008. IEEE","20080415","2008","","","2816","2821","In this paper, we study the election of multiple leaders for intrusion detection in the presence of selfish nodes in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively prolong the overall lifetime of IDS in MANET and balance the resource consumptions among all the nodes.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-1997-5","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489524","","Communications Society;Computer security;Design engineering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection;VCG model;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves model;mechanism design-based multileader election scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;resource consumption balancing;selfish nodes","","9","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes can locally determine their locations through received signal strength variations and inform neighbours about location updates accordingly. In position verification, network nodes verify the position of each node and further ensure that each physical location is bounded by only one identity at any particular time. In this paper we will survey Sybil attack detection techniques and their related issues. Finally we will present our ideas about the Sybil attack detection via one-time localization (only at the entrance into the network) which significantly reduces the communication overhead unlike other schemes where per packet location tracking or periodic dissemination of location information is used to detect Sybil attacks.","","978-1-4244-5401-3","978-1-4244-5402-0","10.1109/DeSE.2009.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395109","Ad hoc networking;RSSI;Wireless networking;identity attack;misbehaviour detection;signal strength;sybil attack","Broadcasting;Communication system security;Computer networks;Cost function;Mobile ad hoc networks;Productivity;Protocols;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","packet location tracking;signal strength based Sybil attack detection;signal strength based position verification;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","16","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By computing the cross-correlation between the control and data traffics, we observe a general 'similar' behavior between the two planes during normal behavior, and that this similarity is affected during abnormal behaviors. This allows us to focus on abnormal changes in network traffic behavior. We test our approach on the Network Intrusion Dataset provided by the Information Exploration Shootout (IES) project and the 1999 DARPA Intrusion detection Evaluation Dataset from the MIT Lincoln Lab. We find that TCP control and data traffic have high correlation levels during benign normal applications. This correlation is reduced when attacks that affect the aggregate traffic are present in the two datasets.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-1693-6","978-1-4244-1694-3","10.1109/IPDPS.2008.4536559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4536559","Network traffic analysis;abnormal behavior;anomaly detection;cross-correlation function;long-range dependence","Aggregates;Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Data engineering;Data security;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","TCP control;computer network intrusion detection;cross-correlation function;data traffic;network traffic behavior analysis","","4","","6","","","14-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
