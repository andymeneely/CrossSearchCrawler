Proceedings. 2001 IEEE Symposium on","20020807","2001","","","50","61","We present a method of analysis for evaluating intrusion detection systems. The method can be used to compare the performance of intrusion detectors, to evaluate performance goals for intrusion detectors, and to determine the best configuration of an intrusion detector for a given environment. The method uses a decision analysis that integrates and extends ROC (receiver operating characteristics) and cost analysis methods to provide an expected cost metric. We provide general results and illustrate the method in several numerical examples that cover a range of detectors that meet a performance goal and two actual detectors operating in a realistic environment. We demonstrate that, contrary to common advice, the value of an intrusion detection system and the optimal operation of that system depend not only on the system's ROC curve, but also on cost metrics and the hostility of the operating environment as summarized by the probability of intrusion. Extensions of the method are outlined, and conclusions are drawn","1081-6011","0-7695-1046-9","","10.1109/SECPRI.2001.924287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=924287","","Cost function;Data analysis;Data mining;Decision theory;Detectors;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Jacobian matrices;Probability;Statistical analysis","decision theory;security of data;software performance evaluation","ROC;cost analysis methods;decision theory;expected cost metric;intrusion detection systems evaluation;performance goals;receiver operating characteristics","","13","1","","","","2001","14 May 2001-16 May 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To better understand this decision, we formulate a model of interdependent network security where there is a system administrator responsible for a network of size n against autonomous attackers attempting to penetrate the network and infect the network machines with viruses or other exploits. We introduce the concept of a loss profile, which encapsulates the idea of variable loss due to infection. Through the application of a simple loss profile to this interdependent network security scenario, we conclude that the decision is dependent upon a number of factors including external and internal vulnerabilities, the types and likelihoods of different amounts of loss, and the interaction of all of these effects. Through this analysis, we form a model for decision-making that is simple to understand and applicable to many other interdependent security scenarios.","","978-1-4673-1108-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280204","","Computational modeling;Computers;Games;Internet;Security;Sociology;Statistics","computer network security;computer viruses;decision making","autonomous attackers;decision making;external vulnerability;interdependent network security;internal vulnerability;loss profile;network machine infection;network penetration;system administrator;variable loss;virus","","1","","8","","","10-12 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By exploiting these vulnerabilities, researchers have also discovered a number of security attacks that can be launched on IEC61850 substation network. These attacks can be categorized into two, which are common network security attacks on IEC61850 network and security attacks that exploit the IEC61850 multicast messages.

Thus, the target satellites should be analyzed frequently in order to monitor their health. Though the approach based on detecting satellite signals is the most reliable and widely applied, it has the disadvantages of heavy workload, long period, low efficiency and poor real-time capability. To solve this problem, this paper presents an approach to recognize constellation satellites' usability automatically by computer using clustering. According to the relationship between satellite's usability and its orbit characteristics, using the latest orbit parameters downloaded from the internet, this approach recognizes the satellites according to their differences in orbit characteristics. This approach has high speed and little manual intervention, which can be used to all the constellations that follow a certain orbit rule, such as Iridium, Globalstar, GPS and so on. Take Iridium for example, the correct rate is 80.44%.","","","","10.1109/FSKD.2013.6816326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816326","Automatic Recognition;Clustering;Constellation Satellites;Usability","Constellation diagram;Orbits;Programmable logic arrays;Satellites;Signal detection;Space vehicles;Usability","Global Positioning System;Internet;artificial satellites;pattern clustering;real-time systems;signal detection","GPS;Globalstar;Internet;Iridium;automatic recognition approach;clustering;constellation satellites usability;health monitoring;orbit characteristic;orbit parameters;real-time capability;satellite signal detection;target satellites","","0","","16","","","23-25 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and communication/ network protocols, and their private networks are physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and efficiently.","","","","10.1109/BWCCA.2013.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690909","Anomaly Detection;IDS;SCADA;Secure Service","Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers","Internet;SCADA systems;computer network security;critical infrastructures;cryptographic protocols;operating systems (computers)","Internet;abnormal command execution identification;base rule set;communication protocol;dynamically produced rule set;intrusion detection system;m-connected SCADA network vulnerability;m-connected status;national critical infrastructure;network anomaly detection;network protocol;network-based pattern reference method;operating systems;pattern reference model;pre-known intrusion pattern;private network;public network;security model;specific threshold value;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","12","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we describe the MeDICi integration framework (MIF), which is a middleware platform we have created to address these challenges. The MIF extends an open source messaging platform with a component-based API for integrating components into analytical pipelines. We describe the features and capabilities of the MIF, and show how it has been used to build a production analytical application for detecting cyber security attacks. The application was composed from multiple independently developed components using several different programming languages.

And it is hard to maintain attack signature database because it should be updated frequently when new kind of attacks appear.

Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for establishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network.

To protect computer hosts from the increasing threat of intrusion, various kinds of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been developed. The main disadvantages of current IDSs are a high false detection rate and the lack of post-intrusion decision support capability. To minimize these drawbacks, we propose an event-driven intrusion detection architecture which integrates subject-verb-object (SVO) multi-point monitors and an impact analysis engine. Alert fusion and verification models are implemented to provide more reasonable intrusion information from incomplete, inconsistent or imprecise alerts acquired by SVO monitors.

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the extended model has significantly reduced the number of false positives.","","978-1-4244-1339-3","978-1-4244-1340-9","10.1109/CEC.2007.4424907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4424907","","Artificial immune systems;Detectors;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Libraries;Mathematical model;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","artificial immune systems;security of data","artificial immune systems;distributed denial of services attacks;extended thymus action;light weight intrusion detection system;malicious traffic;network intrusion detection;network system","","1","3","22","","","25-28 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A DoS attack generates a large amount of traffic, which will occupy the bandwidth and degrade the quality of video. The proposed framework consists of two components: intrusion detection and adaptive transmission management. The intrusion detection component monitors the incoming traffic to the server, detects the attacks, and interacts with the adaptive transmission management component; while the adaptive transmission management component is designed to improve QoS of the video via the efficient utilization of the network resources. With the detection of the DoS attacks, the bandwidth occupied by the attacks can be reduced and protected for video transmission.

According to the limitation of SK-SVM, in this paper we present an intrusion detection method based on multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM). MK-SVM can calculate the weights of kernel functions and Lagrange multipliers simultaneously through semi-infinite linear programming, and thus achieve the choice of kernel functions and the optimization of classifier. Furthermore, in order to reduce the time and space required of this method, we adopt feature selection and clustering method in the process of input data preprocessing.

Bus-based CAN does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus-based CAN are alarming, because safety-critical subsystems (e.g., the power train) often deploy a CAN bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus-based CAN systems. The CAN router establishes a partitioning of a CAN bus into separate CAN segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the CAN system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the CAN router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus-based CAN, but are detected and contained on router-based CAN. The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e.g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the CAN router offers ports that are compatible to standard CAN, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy CAN based systems.","","978-1-4673-2685-8","978-1-4673-2683-4","10.1109/SIES.2012.6356590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356590","","Automotive engineering;Multicast communication;Routing;Security;Software;Topology","computer network security;controller area networks;software maintenance","CAN router;CAN systems security;automotive applications;automotive domain;bus-based CAN;controller area network;denial-of-service attacks;eavesdropping;failure propagation;legacy CAN based systems;message fabrication;power train;router-based CAN;safety domain;safety-critical subsystems;star coupling router;trust model","","2","","24","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","0","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The PMU can be accessed by the PU through the internet using devices, such as PCs/laptops with direct internet access or mobile phones via a Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service access network. The PU consists of an insulin pump for subcutaneous insulin infusion to the patient and a continuous glucose measurement system. The aforementioned devices running a user-friendly application gather patient's related information and transmit it to the PMU. The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment.

Our classification use a combination of keyword matching technique and statistical behavior profiles. Keywords are pre-defined by observing from both audio and video traffic. Behavior profiles consist of three attributes, which are the average received packet size, a ratio of number of server-client packets, and the flow duration. Each attribute have an independent threshold of mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma).

Different intrusion detection techniques can be employed to search for attack patterns in the observed data. Misuse detection and anomaly detection are the most commonly used techniques. But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naïve bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced. This is used to form new features, based on the features of the original data set.

Most existing approaches have focused on intrusion detection and post-attack responses in a similar fashion to fault detection and recovery. However, attack behaviors are much more complex and less predictable than fault behaviors as an attacker often changes his course of actions during the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach that can incorporate behaviors of attackers into the decision analysis of security management. This is especially crucial as attackers can keep advancing their techniques to outsmart security technologies. Our research aims to enhance the science of security that enables behavioral modeling as well as model extensibility. In particular, we present an analytical game theoretic approach to analyzing security of smart grid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems by including attacker/defender behaviors in the proposed sequential, non-zero sum, and two-player game model. The paper describes the development of the game payoffs and illustrates how informed decisions can be made on a real-world scenario of attacks at the sensor level of the smart grid SCADA systems.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007770","Game theory;SCADA;SCADA security;Sequential games;payoffs;utility function","Conferences;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Smart grids","SCADA systems;decision theory;fault diagnosis;game theory;power system faults;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","behavioral modeling;cyber attack game analysis;decision analysis;fault detection;fault recovery;game payoffs development;informed decision derivation;intrusion detection;model extensibility;nonzero sum game model;post-attack response;security management;sequential game model;smart grid SCADA system security;smart grid protection;supervisory control-and-data acquisition;two-player game model","","0","","15","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","86","7","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show through simulation that the AKS scheme can greatly improve the connectivity and security of the existing multiple deployment scheme in wireless sensor networks.","","978-0-7695-2943-1","","10.1109/NPC.2007.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4351510","","Authentication;Base stations;Communication system security;Computer science;Cryptography;Data security;Educational institutions;Network servers;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","adaptive key selection scheme;multiple deployment scheme;security functionality;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","18-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed algorithm selects representative samples from these subgroups such that the samples reflect the entire dataset. An optimum allocation scheme is developed based on the variability of the observations within the subgroups. In the second stage, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the extracted samples to detect intrusions. We call the proposed algorithm as optimum allocation-based least square support vector machine (OA-LS-SVM) for IDS. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the experiments are carried out on KDD 99 database which is considered a de facto benchmark for evaluating the performance of intrusions detection algorithm.

In a distributed Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), collaboration and cooperation is critical concern to managing trust. The networks work well only if the mobile nodes are trusty and behave cooperatively. Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes. Trust-based approach provides a flexible and feasible approach to choose the shortest route that meets the security requirement of data packets transmission. This paper focuses on trust management with their properties and provides a survey of various trust-based approaches and it proposes some novel conceptions on trust management in MANETs.","","","","10.1109/SPACES.2015.7058292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058292","MANET;Properties of Trust;Security;Trust;Trust Management","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;centralized administration;data packets transmission;geographically limited area;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;network security;network topology;packet forwarding misbehaviour;trust management;trust-based approach;trust-based model","","0","","36","","","2-3 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system. The paper presents the Evasion technique for customized apriori algorithm. The paper aims to make a new functional structure to evade NIDS. This framework can be used to audit NIDS.

Flooding DDoS attacks produce adverse effects for critical infrastructure availability, integrity and confidentiality. Current defense approaches cannot efficiently detect and filter out the attack traffic in real time. Online analysis of real time attack traffic and their impact and degradation of host and network based performance metrics becomes very essential. So, online measurement of these network performance metrics itself acts as an Intrusion detection system. The anomalies are the inference for network security analyst to suspect whether the network is under attack or not. Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack. The Interface Based Rate Limiting (IBRL) algorithm proposed in this paper is used to mitigate the identified DDoS attacks. The implementation is carried out on an experimental testbed build up on Linux machines and Virtual routers. The experimental results show that there is considerable increase in the host and network based performance metrics for legitimate users even under DoS and DDoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-1599-9","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206744","Distributed Denial of Service attack;host and network based performance metrics;rate limiting;virtual router","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Internet;Limiting;Measurement;Monitoring;Throughput","Linux;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack;DDoS detection;IBRL;Linux machines;critical infrastructure availability;critical infrastructure confidentiality;critical infrastructure integrity;cyber society;distributed denial of service attacks;experimental testbed;host-network based metrics;host-network based mitigation;interface based rate limiting algorithm;network performance metrics online measurement;real time attack traffic online analysis;virtual routers","","3","","15","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of them scarcely try to combine the two issues together to propose an integrated solution, which is employed to defend the pivotal data and to recover the data when the intrusion has taken place. In this paper, we propose a framework of intrusion detection/recovery system (IDRS). This system is capable of detecting the intrusion on the file-level and recovering data on the block-level. Its advantages include that the file-level detection simplifies the implementation and the recovery based on the block-level can decrease the recovery time and raise the utilization ratio of storage devices. Again, considering that iSCSI has increasingly played an important role in network storage systems, we implement the IDRS prototype based on this promising protocol. The result of tests shows the extra storage overheads, arising from IDRS, are small (less than 10%). Therefore, we believe it is feasible to deploy IRDS on iSCSI systems to protect key files from damage.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529401","","Availability;Data engineering;Data security;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Protection;Protocols","digital storage;file organisation;security of data","IDRS;block-level data recovery;file-level intrusion detection;iSCSI;network storage systems","","1","","16","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An organization should find the methods to protect their data and network system to reduce the risk from attacks. Snort Intrusion Detection System (Snort-IDS) is a security tool of network security. It has been widely used for protecting the network of the organizations. The Snort-IDS utilize the rules to matching data packets traffic. If some packet matches the rules, Snort-IDS will generate the alert messages. However, Snort-IDS contain many rules and it also generates a lot of false alerts. In this paper, we present the procedure to improve the Snort-IDS rules for the network probe attack detection. In order to test the performance evaluation, we utilized the data set from the MIT-DAPRA 1999, which includes the normal and abnormal traffics. Firstly, we analyzed and explored the existing the Snort-IDS rules to improve the proposed Snort-IDS rules. Secondly, we applied the WireShark software to analyze data packets form of attack in data set. Finally, the Snort-IDS was improved, and it can detect the network probe attack. This paper, we had classified the attacks into several groups based on the nature of network probe attack. In addition, we also compared the efficacy of detection attacks between Snort-IDS rules to be updated with the Detection Scoring Truth. As the experimental results, the proposed Snort-IDS efficiently detected the network probe attacks compared to the Detection Scoring Truth. It can achieve higher accuracy. However, there were some detecting alert that occur over the attack in Detection Scoring Truth, because some attack occur in several time but the Detection Scoring Truth indentify as one time.","","","","10.1109/ICoICT.2014.6914042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914042","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Network Security;Network probe attack;Snort-IDS rule","Communication networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols","computer network security;data analysis","MIT-DAPRA;Snort intrusion detection system;Snort-IDS;WireShark software;abnormal traffics;alert messages;data packet analysis;data packet traffic matching;detection scoring truth;false alerts;network probe attack detection;network protection;network system security;normal traffics;performance evaluation","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes new solution based on multi-agent concept for the latest plant automation systems to protect customer investments through integrating security standards into the automation solutions as well as approaching more defenses in depth approaches aligning to IEC 62351 and ISA 99 standards for Industrial Control System Security.","","978-1-4799-6545-8","","10.1109/CIMCA.2014.7057795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7057795","Cyber Security;Distribution Automation;IEC 62351;Industrial Automation;Industrial Network;Network Analysis;Network Security;Smart-Grid","Automation;Control systems;Process control;Protocols;Security;Servers;Standards","IEC standards;industrial control;multi-agent systems;power engineering computing;power system control;security of data","IEC 62351;ISA 99 standards;Industrial Control System Security;anomaly detection;automation networks;industrial automation infrastructure;multiagent based approach;plant automation systems;power plants;security standards","","0","","12","","","21-22 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"High-Performance Intrusion Detection Using OptiGrid Clustering and Grid-Based Labelling","Ishida, M.; Takakura, H.; Okabe, Y.","Grad.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.","","978-1-4577-0531-1","978-0-7695-4423-6","10.1109/SAINT.2011.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129","OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system","Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data","feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data","","3","","16","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20100304","2009","","","1","6","Intrusion detection is one of the fundamental applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Some applications require different detection capabilities at different areas in the deployment field. Gaussian distributed WSNs can fulfill such requirements and are widely deployed in practice. In addition, the presence of some high capability sensors leads to performance enhancement in term of intrusion detection probability. This makes it imperative to explore the intrusion detection problem in heterogeneous WSNs. This work is to examine the intrusion detection problem in a heterogeneous Gaussian distributed WSN theoretically and experimentally. A heterogeneous WSN model with distinct types of Gaussian distributed sensors is proposed, where both single-sensing detection and fe-sensing detection models are employed. Based on this network model, the intrusion detection probabilities under various application scenarios are theoretically derived and experimentally validated by extensive simulations. This work is to provide guidelines in designing heterogeneous WSNs for intrusion detection.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425822","","Acoustic sensors;Acoustic signal detection;Application software;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Magnetic sensors;Mechanical sensors;Monitoring;Optical sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Gaussian distribution;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Gaussian distributed networks;heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;intrusion detection probability","","6","","13","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Toward an Optimal SVM Classification System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images","Bazi, Y.; Melgani, F.","Dept. of Inf. & Commun. Technol., Trento Univ.","Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on","20061030","2006","44","11","3374","3385","Recent remote sensing literature has shown that support vector machine (SVM) methods generally outperform traditional statistical and neural methods in classification problems involving hyperspectral images. However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","0196-2892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine","","91","1","46","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The majority of the research focuses on developing algorithms or signatures for detecting polymorphic and metamorphic payloads. However much of this problem has already been solved through the mainstream use of host based protection mechanisms e.g. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Randomization (ASLR). Many hackers are now using the more inventive attack methods e.g., return-to-libc, which do not inject shell code onto the stack and thus evade DEP and common shell code detection mechanisms. The purpose of this work is to propose a series of generic signatures that could be used to detect network born return-to-libc attacks. To this end we outline how we performed a return-to-libc network based attack, which bypasses DEP and common IDS signatures, before suggesting an efficient signature for detection of similar return-to-libc attacks.","","978-1-4244-5805-9","","10.1109/ICDS.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432802","","Buffer overflow;Computer bugs;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Computer worms;Functional programming;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection","buffer storage;digital signatures","buffer overflow attack;generic signature;metamorphic payload;network intrusion detection system;polymorphic payload;return-to-libc network based attack","","0","","21","","","10-16 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can also accommodate patterns which come up during search time, thus works well for both pre-determined as well as dynamic pattern set. Furthermore, its speed enhances as the minimum pattern length P increases for data set of length n taking O(n/P) time during search.
