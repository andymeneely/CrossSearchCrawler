One of such research efforts is modeling of cyber-attacks. In this context, several modeling approaches have been developed, such as approaches based on attack trees (AT). In this paper, we propose Colored Petri Net (CoPNet) modeling approach by extending the attack trees with new modeling constructs and analysis approaches. CoPNet based attack model is flexible enough to model Internet intrusion, including the static and dynamic features of the intrusion. The process and rules of building CoPNet based attack model from AT are also presented. In order to evaluate the risk of intrusion, some cost elements are added to CoPNet based attack modeling. We show how attack trees can be converted and analyzed in CoPNets. Finally, we provide a case study that illustrates the CoPNet approach.","","978-1-4673-2678-0","","10.1109/INTECH.2012.6457810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457810","AT;Attack Modeling;BG P;CoPNet;Cyber-Attack;Vulnerability","Analytical models;Color;Computational modeling;Logic gates;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Petri nets","Internet;computer network security;trees (mathematics)","BGP systems;CoPNet based attack model;CoPNet modeling approach;Internet intrusion model;attack trees;colored Petri net modeling approach;cyber-attack activities;dynamic intrusion features;static intrusion features","","0","","23","","","18-20 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Artificial immune systems (AIS) is a novel computing paradigm inspired from the human immune system (HIS). The dramatic features of HIS like distributability, uniqueness, adaptability, mobility, imperfect-detection, and anomaly-detection, have grabbed the attention of computational researchers for adopting HIS principles to design AIS that are robust, scalable, highly flexible, resilient to sub-versioning, and degrade gracefully. Designers of AIS make use of their creative abilities for designing computational systems by extracting corresponding metaphors from HIS. AIS is growing as a core paradigm for a wide application area including: intrusion detection, data analysis, pattern recognition, optimization, robotics, distributed control, and bioinformatics etc. The field of AIS, being in its infancy, bears enormous research potential. This work aims to throw light on some prospective research issues in the field. The effort is based on (1) latest research references and (2) our experience for pioneering AIS based research infrastructure in the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).

Each IC, a smart sensor with a one-way outgoing communication over the network, monitors in real-time the status of one or more physical processes and raises an alarm when the monitored process measurements violate predefined constraints. ICs are structurally and behaviorally independent of the cyber-portion of a Cyber Physical System (CPS) and hence are much less likely to be affected by cyber attacks than the control system that monitors and controls a CPS. Thus, ICs serve as devices orthogonal to an existing intrusion detection system and assist in the early detection of successful attacks through independent monitoring of physical processes.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903097","cyber attacks;cyber-physical systems;intelligent checkers;safety;security","Integrated circuits;Liquids;Monitoring;Process control;Purification;Security;Sensors","intelligent sensors;process control;process monitoring;safety;security of data;water treatment","CPS control;control system;cyber attacks;cyber physical systems;intelligent checker design;intrusion detection system;one-way outgoing communication;physical process;predefined constraint violation;process measurement;process monitoring;real-time status monitoring;safety enhancement;security enhancement;smart sensor;successful attack detection;water purification system","","0","","20","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to promptly update the supported rule sets and detect new emerging attacks makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) a very appealing technology. An important issue is how to scale FPGA-based NIDS implementations to ever faster network links. Whereas a trivial approach is to balance traffic over multiple, but functionally equivalent, hardware blocks, each implementing the whole rule set (several thousands rules), the obvious cons is the linear increase in the resource occupation. In this work, we promote a different, traffic-aware, modular approach in the design of FPGA-based NIDS. Instead of purely splitting traffic across equivalent modules, we classify and group homogeneous traffic, and dispatch it to differently capable hardware blocks, each supporting a (smaller) rule set tailored to the specific traffic category. We implement and validate our approach using the rule set of the well-known Snort NIDS, and we experimentally investigate the emerging trade-offs and advantages, showing resource savings up to 80 percent based on real-world traffic statistics gathered from an operator's backbone.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205739","Deep packet inspection;FPGA;Snort;intrusion detection system;string matching;traffic awareness","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Logic gates","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;telecommunication traffic","Snort NIDS;equivalent modules;field programmable gate arrays;hardware blocks;high-speed FPGA network;homogeneous traffic;network intrusion detection systems;network links;real-world traffic statistics;resource occupation;resource savings;traffic-aware design","","1","","40","","2012-05-29","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed scheme is based on using a wavelet based analysis of the received signal strength. We first develop a model to describe the changes in the received signal strength of a wireless station during a session hijack, while the received signal is embedded in colored noise caused by fading wireless channels. An optimal filter is then designed for the purpose of detection. We show that using a Wavelet Transform (WT), the colored noise with complex Power Spectral Density (PSD) in our case can be approximately whitened. Since a larger Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) increases the detection rate and decreases the false alarm rate, the SNR is maximized by analyzing the signal at specific frequency ranges. The detection mechanism is validated using both simulation and experimental results. The detector is shown to be reliable, computationally inexpensive and have minimal impact on the network performance.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2010.04.081447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5441359","Network security, intrusion detection.","Colored noise;Computational modeling;Fading;Filters;Frequency;Signal analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms;Wireless networks","safety systems;telecommunication security;time series;wavelet transforms;wireless channels","fading wireless channels;optimal filter;power spectral density;received signal strength;session hijacks;wavelet based analysis;wavelet transform;wireless networks","","1","","13","","","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6231-5","","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Asymmetric Concurrency;Computational Model;Intrusion Detection;Memory Observation","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data structures;Information security;Interference;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","computational model;concealment mechanism;concurrent observations;concurrent processing units;cost model;data structures;forced synchronization;interleaved linearization;malicious code;observation mechanism;privilege escalation;resource contention;second-order operation;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency","","2","","19","","","11-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nowadays, the question is not whether organizations need more security, but how much to spend for added security. And yet investing in IT security has always been a hard sell for IT managers. Scores of security technologies are on the market and, if anything is certain, it is that none of them can guarantee security. Each choice involves risk. The problem is that security managers lack structured cost-benefit methods to evaluate IT security solutions in light of prevailing uncertainties. A framework can help evaluate the costs and benefits of IT security solutions using a company's risk profile. Using an unconventional concept, this framework bases benefit on avoided risk rather than increased productivity. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) uses this framework to help demonstrate to management and auditors that it is significantly less expensive to accept some damage from cyberattacks than to attempt to prevent all possible damages. This pragmatic approach continues to enable LBNL's cybersecurity staff to optimize security countermeasure investments and reduce spending without sacrificing protection. The framework described here uses a risk management approach that integrates risk profile with actual damages and implementation costs to determine the costs and benefits of information security solutions. This approach requires reasonably voluminous data and is thus well suited for organizations with extensive incident data or when the consequences of incidents are high enough to warrant extensive data gathering.","1520-9202","","","10.1109/MITP.2004.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1390871","","Computer crime;Computer security;Costs;Data security;Information security;Investments;Laboratories;National security;Productivity;Uncertainty","DP management;information technology;investment;risk management;security of data","IT management;IT security solutions;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory;cost-benefit methods;information security;risk management;risk profile;risk-based value measurement;security countermeasure investment optimization;security management","","8","","5","","","Nov.-Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network monitoring system detects anomalies such as attacks, states of hosts or services, resources. The aim of this is recognizes network faults and attacks quickly. A method widely used for almost network monitoring systems is setup agents on servers, network devices and then establishing connections between them and monitoring servers using some protocols such as ICMP and SNMP. These servers send periodic requests to agents to get reports or agents send traps to network monitoring servers. With this method, it must long time to alert. We propose a solution to fast detecting some anomalies such as servers or devices operate with high frequency (called “hot IPs”) and low frequency (called “low IPs”) and it works independently to early warning for these anomalies using non-adaptive group testing method. In particular, if dealing with up to 260,000 IPs, we can detect up to 31 hot and low IPs within 2.5 minutes.","","","","10.1109/ICTC.2013.6675536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675536","Group Testing;Hot IPs;Low IPs;Networking Anomaly","","IP networks;computer centres;computer network security;computerised monitoring;network servers;protocols","ICMP protocol;SNMP protocol;big data centers;discontinuous network reduction;error correction;hot-IP;low-IP;monitoring servers;network attacks;network device monitoring operation;network faults;network monitoring servers;network monitoring system;networking anomaly detection;nonadaptive group testing;server farms;server monitoring operation;setup agents","","2","","26","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the state-of-the-art, IDS produce voluminous alerts, most false alarms, and function mainly by recognizing the signatures of known attacks so that novel attacks slip past them. Attempts have been made to create systems that recognize the signature of “normal”, in the hope that they will then detect attacks, known or novel. These systems are often confounded by the extreme variability of nominal behavior. This paper describes an experiment with an IDS composed of a hierarchy of neural networks (NN) that functions as a true anomaly detector. This result is achieved by monitoring selected areas of network behavior, such as protocols, that are predictable in advance. While this does not cover the entire attack space, a considerable number of attacks are carried out by violating the expectations of the protocol/operating system designer. Within this focus, the NNs are trained using data that spans the entire normal space. These detectors are able to recognize attacks that were not specifically presented during training. We show that using small detectors in a hierarchy gives a better result than a single large detector. Some techniques can be used not only to detect anomalies, but to distinguish among them","","0-7803-6521-6","","10.1109/MILCOM.2000.904111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904111","","Detectors;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Monitoring;Network servers;Neural networks;Physics;Protection;Protocols;Statistics","backpropagation;neural nets;safety systems;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ANN;IDS;TCP;anomaly detector;attack signatures recognition;backpropagation neural networks;false alarms;intrusion detection;network behavior monitoring;operating system;protocols","","1","","6","","","2000","22 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security mechanism for WSNs has to be considered differently from traditional network. Firstly, there are severe constraints on WSNs devices such as minimal energy, computational and communicational capabilities. Secondly, there is an additional risk of physical attacks such as node capture and tampering. Moreover, cryptography based techniques alone are insufficient to secure WSNs. Hence, intrusion detection techniques must be designed and developed to detect the any kind of undesirable attacks. Further, these techniques should be lightweight because of resource-constrained nature of WSNs. Therefore, we present a new approach of robust and lightweight solution for detecting the sinkhole attack based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings of messages. The proposed solution needs collaboration of some extra monitor (EM) nodes apart from the ordinary nodes. We use values of RSSI from four EM nodes to determine the position of all sensor nodes where the base station (BS) is located at origin position (0,0). We use this information as weight from the BS in order to detect sinkhole attack. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is lightweight due to the monitor nodes were not loaded with any ordinary nodes or BS. Moreover, the proposed mechanism does not cause the communication overhead.","","978-4-907764-34-0","978-4-907764-33-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334764","detecting sinkhole attacks;intruder detection;security in wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power system security;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","RSSI;base station;communication system;extra monitor node;intrusion detection;node capture;physical attack;received signal strength indicator;security system;sinkhole attack detection;tampering;wireless sensor network","","0","","19","","","18-21 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently exerted defence system based on the use of firewall, antivirus software and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) represents a necessary minimum. This traditional approach to security of computer systems is primarily oriented to the defence against already existing threats. It is essential to adapt the security system to this trend as the current threats have much more aggressive forms. The use of decoy based security technology - Honeypot - represents an adequate form of defence. However, even this technology is not a “security panacea” as its 100% functionality is proportionally dependent on the specific installation process.

The RRS-based Common Tactical Radio System (GTRS), currently in development by the Swedish Armed Forces, is designed for use in diverse geographical settings and for purposes varying from international combat missions to national contingency operations. However, protecting these networks from attacks and safeguarding the carried information against leaks is an ongoing research challenge, especially in combined scenarios where tactical data may flow across organizational boundaries. This paper presents a best-effort approach to Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) for inter-organizational RRS-based networks. The proposed architecture makes use of data mining techniques and an efficient n-dimensional clustering algorithm which has previously been successfully used for real-time anomaly detection in critical infrastructure protection. The DLP architecture is developed as an extension to the GTRS system, modeled and simulated in OPNET™ Modeler.

Inside the infrastructure, specific runtime protections have been implemented for different kernel objects, kernel data structures are protected by the periodic detection and recovery, the interception of arguments is used to protect vulnerable system calls. At runtime once any system inconsistency has been detected, predefined recovery actions will be invoked. The consistency detection regulations and corresponding recovery actions can also be flexibly customized by system developers. The infrastructure requires few modifications to kernel source code, thus it is easy to integrate into existing embedded systems. The evaluation experiment results indicate our prototype system can correctly detect the inconsistent kernel data structures caused by security attacks and also prevent kernel from exploits due to vulnerable system calls with acceptable penalty to system performance. Moreover, it is fully software-based without introducing any specific hardware and requires no modifications to system call APIs, therefore legacy commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) applications can be also easily reused.","","978-0-7695-3492-3","","10.1109/EUC.2008.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756331","Detection;Recovery;Reliability;Security","Data security;Data structures;Embedded system;Kernel;Object detection;Protection;Prototypes;Runtime;Software prototyping;System performance","application program interfaces;data structures;embedded systems;operating system kernels;security of data;system monitoring;system recovery","commercial-off-the-shelf application;embedded system;kernel data structure;kernel object;kernel source code;lightweight system-level detection;recovery infrastructure;runtime protection;security attack;system call API;system call function;vulnerable system call","","0","","22","","","17-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve energy-efficiency and reliability, a subset of sensor nodes are randomly selected as monitors in the network and each sensor node is monitored by at least k nodes. For the resistance against the attacks, the monitors are protected from identity exposure to prevent them becoming the explicit targets of adversaries. A collective monitoring triggering scheme is also proposed to further improve the capability and reliability of monitoring.

In cognitive radio networks, effect of these malicious users on network performance becomes more threatening, where they impersonate primary users by emitting similar signals, causing secondary users to vacate the occupied channel needlessly. As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is shown by calculating the throughput of the network and number of channel switches with respect to varying number of secondary and malicious nodes and by comparing it to an earlier proposed TCP protocol.","","978-1-4799-2293-2","","10.1109/FIT.2013.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717217","cognitive radio networks;cross layer design;security;transport layer protocol","Adaptation models;Cognitive radio;Hidden Markov models;Protocols;Throughput;Training;Wireless networks","access protocols;cognitive radio;computer network security;hidden Markov models;transport protocols;wireless channels","MAC layer;TCP protocol;channel switches;cognitive radio network;cross-layered approach;hidden Markov model;malicious node;open medium access;security threat;transport layer protocol;wireless channel;wireless network","","0","","23","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be achieved by profiling the traffic. A fully profiled traffic can contain significant information of the network's current state, and can be further used to detect anomalous traffic. Many has addressed problems of profiling network traffic, but unfortunately there are no specific profiles could lasts forever for one particular network, since network traffic characteristic always changes over and over based on the sum of nodes, software that being used, type of access, etc. This paper introduces an online adaptive system using evolving connectionist systems based connectionist model to profile network traffic in continuous manner while at the same time try to detect anomalous activity inside the network in real-time and adapt with changes if necessary. Different from an offline approach, which usually profile network traffic using previously captured data for a certain period of time, an online and adaptive approach can use a shorter period of data capturing and evolve its profile if the characteristics of the network traffic has changed.","","0-7803-9091-1","","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527622","Adaptive System;Distributed Anomaly Detection;Evolvable-Neural-Based Fuzzy Inference System;Evolving Connectionist Systems","Adaptive systems;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","adaptive systems;computer networks;evolutionary computation;fuzzy reasoning;neural nets;real-time systems;security of data","anomalous traffic detection;connectionist model;distributed adaptive network anomaly detection system;evolvable-neural-based fuzzy inference system;evolving connectionist system;network diagnosis;network traffic profiling;real-time detection","","2","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since software implementation may not keep pace with the high-speed demand, turning to hardware-based solutions becomes promising. This work presents an innovative architecture to realize string matching in sub-linear time based on algorithmic heuristics, which come from parallel queries to a set of space-efficient Bloom filters. The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module. This architecture is simulated with both behavior simulation in C and timing simulation in HDL for antivirus applications. The simulation shows that the throughput of scanning Windows executable files for more than 10000 virus signatures can achieve 5.64 Gb/s, while the worst-case performance is 1.2 Gb/s if the signatures are properly specified.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2012011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840440","Algorithms;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);string matching","","C language;digital signatures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;integrated circuit design;logic design;program verification;string matching","Bloom filter;C language;HDL;algorithmic heuristics;antivirus application;bad-block heuristic;behavior simulation;field programmable gate array;hardware accelerator;linear worst-case time method;network security;nonblocking interface;parallel query;sublinear time string-matching algorithm;timing simulation;verification module;virus signature","","5","","39","","2009-04-24","Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm was demonstrated on anomalous ICMP network packets (input) and Snort rules (output of the algorithm). Output rules were sorted according to a fitness value and any duplicates were removed. The experimental results on ten test cases demonstrated a 100 percent rule alert rate.

Most of the existing key management schemes concentrate only on network structures and key allocation algorithms, ignoring attributes of the nodes themselves. Due to the distributed and dynamic nature of MANETs, it is possible to show that there is a security benefit to be attained when the node states are considered in the process of constructing a private key generator (PKG). In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical key management scheme in which nodes can get their keys updated either from their parent nodes or a threshold of sibling nodes. The proposed scheme can select the best nodes to be used as PGKs from all available ones considering their security conditions and energy states. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can decrease network compromising probability and increase network lifetime.","","978-1-4244-5238-5","978-1-4244-5239-2","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379731","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379731","","Computer network management;Computer networks;Cryptography;Engineering management;Identity management systems;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Research and development;Research and development management;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;cryptography;military communication;mobile communication;telecommunication network management","hierarchical identity based key management scheme;military applications;network lifetime;tactical mobile ad hoc networks","","1","","15","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A huge variety of malware typically spreads over the Internet, evolving every day, and challenging the research community and security practitioners to improve the effectiveness of countermeasures. In this paper, we present a system that automatically extracts patterns of network activity related to a specific malicious event, i.e., a seed. Our system is based on a methodology that correlates network events of hosts normally connected to the Internet over (i) time (i.e., analyzing different samples of traffic from the same host), (ii) space (i.e., correlating patterns across different hosts), and (iii) network layers (e.g., HTTP, DNS, etc.). The result is a Network Connectivity Graph that captures the overall ""network behavior"" of the seed. That is a focused and enriched representation of the malicious pattern infected hosts exhibit, purified from ordinary network activities and background traffic. We applied our approach on a large dataset collected in a real commercial ISP where the aggregated traffic produced by more than 20,000 households has been monitored. A commercial IDS has been used to complement network data with alerts related to malicious activities. We use such alerts to trigger our processing system. Results shows that the richness of the Network Connectivity Graph provides a much more detailed picture of malicious activities, considerably enhancing our understanding.","","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288435","","IP networks;Itemsets;Malware;Monitoring;Protocols;Servers","Internet;graph theory;invasive software","Internet;Malware;malicious activities;malicious pattern;malicious traffic dissection;network behavior;network connectivity graph;network user privacy;network users security;research community;security practitioners","","","","","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","14","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919","Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.","Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement","Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration","","3","","32","","2010-11-09","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This research shows that it is possible to derive configuration file(s) to setup different security measures based on the input from system description files. In addition, we highlight an important anomaly in industrial control systems, namely the missing/tardiness of expected traffic. In this paper, we show how the proposed system works by taking IEC 61850 SCD files and generating configuration files for security measures such as firewall and IDS/IPS. Additionally, current IDS/IPS only raise an alert when unexpected traffic appears in the system. They do not alert on the disappearance of the expected traffic.

In this sense, approaches like localized geographic routing are very promising. Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph of the network. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We motivate our work by discussing application scenarios that benefit from our scheme and suggest basic mechanisms for choosing appropriate curves. We further present preliminary results from an implementation of our curve-based routing scheme.","2155-6806","978-1-4577-1345-3","","10.1109/MASS.2011.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076605","Algorithms;localized routing;network protocols;routing algorithms;wireless multihop networks","Ad hoc networks;Joining processes;Mobile computing;Routing;Spread spectrum communication;Trajectory;Wireless networks","radio networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","curve-based planar graph routing;face routing extension;localized geographic routing;multihop wireless network;network protocol;routing algorithm scalability","","0","","10","","","17-22 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An attack in Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is due to unreliability, unfixed topology, limited battery power and lack of centralized control. The first line of defense solutions is Encryption and authentication which are not adequate to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Existing IDSs for MANETS depend on the Watchdog technique. In existing system Researchers main attraction is on designing new prevention, detection and response mechanism for MANETs. The scheme will identify, supervise and observe the malicious nodes without adjusting the performances in the network. The motivation is to overcome the issues such as “limited transmission power, packet dropping, receiver collision and false misbehavior reports” generation of the Watchdog system. In this paper, we proposed a new the Modified Version of EAACK based IDS that is used to overcome the MANET attacks.

No protocol has been designed and implemented so far to parameterize security as a QoS parameter. However, it has been noted recently that security and QoS are highly intertwined; security mechanisms may severely affect QoS mechanisms in terms of network performance and data confidentiality. In addition, users are not given the choices on which security services and mechanisms as well as which security level should be applied to their traffic. A security-enhanced quality of service-based (SQoS) network has been presented recently, with two major objectives. One objective is to offer the users elastic choices on the treatment of messages with appropriate security mechanisms with respect to their own QoS and budget requirements. Another objective is to facilitate interaction between security and QoS mechanisms in the most efficient manner by providing information to each other. In this paper, the network performance is investigated by defining the utility functions and maximizing the user's benefits subject to a set of constraints","","0-7803-9393-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605990","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Computer security;Data security;Information security;Laboratories;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","performance evaluation;quality of service;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","SQoS network;network performance analysis;network traffic;security-enhanced quality of service;utility function","","1","","8","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a compile-time analysis and transactional memory runtime system that allows several irrevocable transactions to execute concurrently with normal revocable transactions unlike state-of-the-art methods that allow for at most one irrevocable transaction at a time. Our approach uses a compile-time analysis to derive a fine-grained lock-assignment scheme using a precise context-sensitive data structure analysis that is able to identify disjoint logical data structures.
