We describe advanced capabilities for mission-centric cyber situational awareness, based on defense in depth, provided by the Cauldron tool. Cauldron automatically maps all paths of vulnerability through networks, by correlating, aggregating, normalizing, and fusing data from a variety of sources. It provides sophisticated visualization of attack paths, with automatically generated mitigation recommendations. Flexible modeling supports multi-step analysis of firewall rules as well as host-to-host vulnerability, with attack vectors inside the network as well as from the outside.

Instead, intruders perform their attacks through a sequence of intermediary hosts before attacking the target. This type of attack is known as a ""stepping-stone attack"". Stepping-stone detection is to determine if a host machine is being used as a stepping-stone by attackers. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for stepping-stone detection using a pervious mapping-based detection method. The technique reduces the detection problem to finding a mapping between two streams of packets. If our algorithm cannot find the mapping, then no such mapping exists. But if there is a mapping, then the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find one and the solution will always be the one with minimum indexed. We provide the proof of the correctness of the algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithm has a low time complexity.

The HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision. In the implementation, radial basis function model is used, because of its simplicity and its flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the soft decision based on the neural network, the robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved.

With the onset of gigabit networks, current generation networking components for NIDS will soon be insufficient for numerous reasons; most notably because the existing methods cannot support high-performance demands. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%. Moreover, using extensive pipelining and hardware parallelism, it can be shown that for realistic workloads, our architectures for FEM and outlier analysis achieve 21.25- and 23.76-Gb/s core throughput, respectively.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.916288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451089","Feature extraction;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);network intrusion detection system (NIDS);principal component analysis (PCA)","Adaptive arrays;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Software performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;feature extraction module;network administrator;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;outlier detection method;principal component analysis","","15","6","39","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes a new framework to detect anomalies and to provide early alerts for flooding attacks in backbone networks. Thus allow to quickly react in order to prevent the flooding attacks from strangling the victim server and its access network. The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and false alarm rate. It is able to detect low intensity attacks covered by the large number of traffic in high speed network.","0742-1303","978-1-61284-926-3","","10.1109/LCN.2011.6115504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6115504","Anomaly detection;BOTNET;Chi-Square divergence;DDoS;Intrusion Detection System;Least Mean Square;SYN flooding;Sketch","Data structures;IP networks;Monitoring;Probability distribution;Radiation detectors;Time series analysis;Vectors","Internet;least mean squares methods;network servers;security of data;subscriber loops;telecommunication services;telecommunication traffic","Internet services;Japan;Pearson chi-square divergence;USA;access network;backbone network traffic;denial of service;detection accuracy;false alarm rate;flooding attacks detection;least mean square filter;probability distributions;random aggregation;randomly aggregated flows;real IP traces;sketch data structure;time series;trans-Pacific transit link;victim server","","4","","32","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HonIDS is characterized by its layered structure and is enhanced by two detection models: TFRPP (times, frequency, range, port risk, average payload length) model and Bayes model. The basic idea of these models is that although it is hard to directly judge whether one interaction with the honeypots is an attack or malicious activity, it is possible to identify intruders by analyzing the plentiful and global events of honeypots in a given period of time. The TFRPP model gives the honeypot system the ability to assess different risks, by assigning dubiety scores to the hosts who visited honeypots. The Bayes detection model can detect some main types of attacks by classification.

For example, a security system may be deployed using WSNs as outlined in M. Turon, J. Suh (Apr. 2005), and P. Dutta., et al., (Apr. 2005). Furthermore, WSNs are of particular interest to adversaries due to their frequent deployments in open and unprotected environments. Preventive mechanisms can sometimes be applied to protect WSNs from an assortment of attacks. However, in many cases, a more sophisticated methodology needs to be applied for situations in which intrusions or attacks cannot necessarily be anticipated in advance. In such instances, an intrusion detection system is warranted. For WSNs, one of the primary concerns deals with availability of the network and individual nodes. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are a particularly great threat to WSNs. The effects of a DoS attack are described extensively in A.D. Wood and J.A. Stankovic (Oct. 2002),and http://www.tinyos.net. WSNs are particularly vulnerable to failure under such attacks because of their limited energy, processing capacity, and storage. An effective DoS attack merely has to deplete the resources of the nodes to render them unavailable. In this paper we design and implement a preliminary intrusion detection system (IDS) for WSNs that addresses the security concern of DoS attacks and fits the demands and restrictions of WSNs.","","978-1-4244-0941-9","978-1-4244-0941-9","10.1109/EIT.2007.4374444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4374444","Attack;Denial of Service (DoS);Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Network","Batteries;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Event detection;Floods;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","denial of service attacks;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","5","","15","","","17-20 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model.

In this paper we introduce FloTracker that is an online log-free host-based root-cause analysis detection engine, with instantaneous forensics capabilities. FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to eventually create a thriving developer-community, where developers around the world contribute reusable modules and designs for the benefit of the community as a whole. To this end, we have created a repository of ldquoUser Contributed Designsrdquo at NetFPGA.org. But creating an ldquoopen-source hardwarerdquo platform is quite different from software oriented open-source projects. Designing hardware is much more time consuming-and more error prone-than designing software, and so demands a process that is more focussed on verifying that a module really works as advertised, else others will be reluctant to use it. We have designed a novel process for contributing new designs. Each contributed design is specified entirely by a set of tests it passes. A developer includes a list of tests that their design will pass, along with an executable set of tests that the user can check against. Through this process, we hope to establish the right expectations for someone who reuses a design, and to encourage sound design practices with solid, repeatable and integrated testing. In this paper we describe the philosophy behind our process, in the hope that others may learn from it, as well as describe the details of how someone contributes a new design to the NetFPGA repository.","","978-1-4244-4407-6","978-1-4244-4406-9","10.1109/MSE.2009.5270838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270838","","Acoustic testing;Education;Ethernet networks;Internet;Open source hardware;Open source software;Process design;Software design;Software standards;Solids","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;open systems;user centred design","NetFPGA platform;NetFPGA repository;NetFPGA.org;developer-community;integrated testing;networking systems;open-source hardware platform;reusable modules;reusable network hardware design;software oriented open-source projects;user contributed designs","","0","","7","","","25-27 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regrettably, current solutions are far from perfect, since they either produce a large number of false positives or they can only detect already known attacks. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving IDS performance, i.e. achieving high detection while reducing false positives. In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level. We present an ontology-based approach to correlation, and describe how it can be implemented as a distributed, highly scalable system.

To detect and prevent this kind of attacks, it is typical to build anomaly intrusion detection system (AIDS) to distinguish a legitimate user from an intruder, called masquerader. One important hypothesis of this type of detection is: different user exhibits different behavior in their online activities. The user behavior can be captured and compared. The efficiency of AIDS relies on the quality of the training data. Many prior studies encounter the problem of low hit rates and high false alarms. In this paper, we study the relationship between the user behavior in terms of operating system commands and the success rate of detection. We first used the principal component analysis (PCA) to select the commands that are highly effective in distinguishing users. Then we use these commands to classify users into categories. Our analysis shows a strong correlation between the false rate and the distance between these categories.","","978-0-7695-3382-7","","10.1109/ISDA.2008.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696203","Intrusion Detection;Masqueraders;Network Security;Principal Component Analysis;Profiles","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Detectors;Electrochemical machining;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing;Training data","operating systems (computers);principal component analysis;security of data","PCA;anomaly intrusion detection system;masquerade detection;operating system commands;principal component analysis;user behavior analysis","","2","","17","","","26-28 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Senior-level managers or executives should review process measurement data regularly to ensure that these defenses are being performed properly and to provide an objective basis for organizational improvement. This article focuses on lessons learned implementing improvements in the first of these defenses, security patch management, and is derived largely from pilot projects conducted in collaboration with Consortium members.

Accurate identification of P2P traffic makes great sense for efficient network management and reasonable utility of network resources. Application level classification of P2P traffic, especially without payload feature detection, is still a challenging problem. This paper proposes a new method for P2P traffic identification and application level classification, which merely uses transport layer information. The method uses support vector machines which have been optimized for performing large learning tasks, rendering that this method become more suitable for large network traffic. The experimental results show that this method achieved high efficiency and is suitable for real-time identification.

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527","Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior","","2","","30","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe both single-stage and multi-stage solutions for the game in terms of its Nash and Perfect Bayesian Equilibriums.

This proliferation, in combination with the interconnection of networks via the Internet, has drastically increased their vulnerability to attack by malicious agents. The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods. Fuzzy-based systems accommodate the imprecision associated with mutated and previously unidentified attack modes. This paper presents an evolutionary-fuzzy approach to intrusion detection that is shown to provide superior performance in comparison to other evolutionary approaches. In addition, the method demonstrates improved robustness in comparison to other evolutionary-based techniques.","","978-1-4244-7859-0","978-1-4244-7857-6","10.1109/NAFIPS.2010.5548289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548289","evolutionary computation;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithms;network intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Uncertainty","Internet;computer network security;evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory;optimisation","Internet;computer network;evolutionary based system;evolutionary optimization;fuzzy rule based network intrusion detection system;malicious agent;mobile network","","1","","18","","","12-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How is it possible to assess the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) ability to meet corporate security requirements? Can one monitor and enforce the agreed cloud security levels? Unfortunately, no comprehensive solutions exist for these issues. In this context, we introduce a new approach, named SPECS. It aims to offer mechanisms to specify cloud security requirements and to assess the security features offered by CSPs, and to integrate the desired security services (e.g., credential and access management) into cloud services with a Security-as-a-Service approach. Furthermore, SPECS intends to provide systematic approaches to negotiate, to monitor and to enforce the security parameters specified in Service Level Agreements (SLA), to develop and to deploy security services that are cloud SLA-aware and are implemented as an open-source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

Centralized access control determination fails to work in mobile ad-hoc networking environments, as the information necessary for pre-configuration is not available. This situation is exacerbated by the dynamic nature of the environment's membership, so that the time and resources expended in offline management are largely wasted. This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate interaction partners. A distributed, node-centric approach to reputation management processes nodal behavior feedback and provides a reputation index that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations. The availability of a reputation index gives a measure of expectation of a peer's behavior, based on past performance, and makes a MANET a more distributed operational environment.","","0-7803-9290-6","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495969","","Access control;Availability;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Environmental management;Feedback;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Resource management;Waste management","ad hoc networks;authorisation;computer network management;groupware;mobile radio;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc collaborative environment;decentralized trust-based access control system;distributed node-centric approach;distributed operational environment;dynamic collaboration;interaction partners;mobile ad hoc network;nodal behavior feedback;offline management;peer trustworthiness;reputation index;reputation management;sociological trust;trust management","","5","","28","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show how an intrusion detection system can recognize the plans of the intruder by modeling the domain as a logic program and then reducing the plan recognition problem to computing models of the logic program. This methodology has been used widely for several planning problems and fits very naturally for plan recognition problems. We give an example scenario and show how to model it.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generated by exploiting these vulnerabilities have performance impact on both victim as well as on other hosts sharing the communication path. Hence in order to protect the computational and bandwidth resources of the shared path, the anomalies caused by these attacks are to be detected and the attack traffic should be filtered out from the network elements. Under the context of flow state maintenance not deployed in the network elements, the bandwidth characterization of the attack traffic is essential to deploy the filtering rules in the equipments. In this work we have considered the network bandwidth characterization of a highly critical DDoS attack in the network: the distributed reflector attack through spoofed IPv6 flows. The generated spoofed IPv6 traffic from the attacker (slaves), the reflector attack traffic caused by the responses from the reflector and the victim, and the end-to-end path bandwidth characteristics of these flows over a 6 to 4 tunnel are reported in terms of flow rates and per flow packet count. The flow rate pattern of the spoofed flows is modeled at the attacker side using inter departure time and packet size. The impact of network scale factor on the flow rate pattern over the path is studied and reported. We also have quantified the reflector attack flow rate in the presence of the scale factor and multiple spoofed flow sources.","0742-1303","978-1-61284-926-3","","10.1109/LCN.2011.6115573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6115573","","Bandwidth;Estimation;Generators;Level measurement;Servers;Size measurement;Time measurement","IP networks;next generation networks;protocols;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;IPv6 based reflector attacks;IPv6 communication protocol;distributed denial of service;flow state maintenance;next generation networks;path behavior characteristics;security threats","","0","","13","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the inherent nature of PCM technology does not align perfectly with either applications in terms of cost-per-bit, performance, power, endurance or retention. The missing killer applications for PCM have slowed down the technology development from becoming mainstream. From the systems perspective, the ever-growing big data problems call for a paradigm shift from traditional compute-centric system to data-centric system for better performance, efficiency and productivity. A data-centric system will demand new hardware features to support the efficient storage and manipulation of data in a wide range of data-intensive applications. Considering these factors, this paper will give an overview of recent research efforts to enable PCM for building a reliable and efficient ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). By leveraging multiple levels of computing stack - technology, circuit and architecture, we will show a holistic approach of tailoring PCM to meeting the new system requirements.

The heterogeneous distance functions are used to cluster data in this paper. The cooperative network intrusion detection based on semi-supervised clustering algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the network data flows are divided into three data flows (TCP flow, UDP flow, and ICMP flow) according to network protocol and are sent to three detection agents. Then every detection agent constructs the detection model using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm based on the HVDM (Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric) distance. Finally, revise and verify the detection model by using test data. Simulation experiments are done by using KDD CUP 1999 data set, results show that the method presented here is feasible and efficient.","","978-1-4244-6763-1","","10.1109/CSCWD.2010.5471988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5471988","Cluster;Cooperative;Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm;Heterogeneous Distance Function;Intrusion Detection","Cities and towns;Clustering algorithms;Collaborative work;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Partitioning algorithms;Protection;Protocols;Testing","","","","0","","16","","","14-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mathematical transformation algorithms have proven effective at interpreting multilingual, unstructured data, but high computational requirements of such algorithms prevent their widespread use. The rate of computation can be vastly increased with field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware. To experiment with this approach, we developed a system with FPGAs that ingests content over a network at high data rates. The system extracts basewords, counts words, scores documents, and discovers concepts on data that are carried in TCP/IP network flows as packets over a Gigabit Ethernet link or in cells transported over an OC48 link. These algorithms, as implemented in FPGA hardware, introduce certain constraints on the complexity and richness of the semantic processing algorithms. To understand the implications of these constraints and to benchmark the performance of the system, we have performed a series of experiments processing multilingual documents. In these experiments, we compare techniques to generate basewords for our semantic concepts, score documents, and discover concepts across a variety of processing operational scenarios","","0-7803-9545-X","","10.1109/AERO.2006.1656050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656050","","Acceleration;Computational intelligence;Computational linguistics;Data mining;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;National security;Sorting;Testing;Text analysis","field programmable gate arrays;local area networks;natural languages;text analysis","FPGA hardware;Gigabit Ethernet link;OC48 link;TCP/IP network flows;baseword extraction;document scoring;document streams;field programmable gate array;hardware accelerated algorithms;multilingual document processing;multilingual unstructured data;semantic concepts;semantic processing;word counting","","7","5","19","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the one hand, the PHEV owner needs to charge its PHEV through the grid, given possibly time-varying electricity pricing schemes. On the other hand, the energy stored in a PHEV can also be sold back to the grid so as to act as an ancillary service while possibly generating revenues to its owner. Consequently, this motivates the need to develop smart charging policies that enable the PHEV owner to optimally decide on when to charge or discharge its vehicle, while minimizing its long-term energy consumption cost. In this paper, we model this PHEV energy management problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is solved by using a linear programming (LP) technique so as to obtain the optimal charging policy. In particular, we devise optimal charging policies that are resilient to the price information attacks such as denial of service (DoS) attacks and price manipulation attacks over the grid's communication network. We show that, under potential price information attacks, each PHEV can optimize its charging policies given only an estimated price information, which leads to a discrepancy between the real and expected costs. To this end, we analyze this cost difference using the proposed MDP model, which can also guide the system designer and administrator to decide whether reinforcing the system's security is required. The simulation results show that the proposed PHEV charging policy is effective and is adaptable to different PHEV mobility patterns, battery levels and varying electricity prices. It is also demonstrated that improving the system's ability to detect and resolve the attack can obviously reduce the impact brought by the attacks.","","978-1-4673-0910-3","978-1-4673-0909-7","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486015","","Batteries;Discharges (electric);Electricity;Energy consumption;Positron emission tomography;Pricing;Roads","Markov processes;battery powered vehicles;energy management systems;hybrid electric vehicles;linear programming;power engineering computing;pricing;smart power grids","DoS attacks;G2V communications;LP technique;MDP;Markov decision process;V2G communications;administrator;ancillary service;battery levels;bidirectional energy flow;denial of service attacks;energy management problem;grid communication network;grid-to-vehicle communications;linear programming technique;long-term energy consumption cost minimization;mobility patterns;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;power grids;price information attacks;price manipulation attacks;resilient PHEV charging policies;smart charging policies;smart grid;system designer;system security;time-varying electricity pricing schemes;vehicle-to-grid communications","","3","","11","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The alert verification module adopts a novel rule learning based mechanism which analyzes the change of system behavior caused by an intrusion to determine whether an attack succeeded and therefore lower the number of false alarms.

To better defend these PoIs, the design of the bistatic radar network is investigated in two stages. First, we study the problem of optimally placing a number of radar transmitters and receivers in the sense of minimizing the maximum distance product between a PoI and its closest transmitter-receiver pair. For this problem, we propose a randomized Voronoi algorithm. Next, given the radars' locations, assuming that the transmitters use fixed and orthogonal frequencies to illuminate signals for interference avoidance, we study the problem of frequency selection for the receivers. Since an intelligent attacker can adaptively change the PoI to attack, the receivers should dynamically adapt their frequencies to cover different subsets of the PoIs. Accordingly, we model the dynamic interactions between the bistatic radar network and the attacker as a repeated security game. Based on their respective information, we propose two learning algorithms for each of them, respectively. We show that if both players follow the modified-regret-matching procedures, the empirical distributions of their actions converge to the set of correlated equilibria.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2013.011713.120892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416889","Bistatic radar network;learning algorithm;node placement;repeated game;security game","Bistatic radar;Games;Receivers;Security;Transmitters;Vectors","","","","0","","21","","2013-01-22","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This has been manifested as an every increasing range of new protocols, new encryption algorithms, new methods of authentication, smarter firewalls and intrusion detection techniques, new anti-malware products and many more. During the same period of time increasing demands for more trustworthy network infrastructure have seen the development of sophisticated analysis tools necessary to meet the operational requirements of law enforcement agencies. These include tools for e-discovery, commercial intelligence and national security. Thus the industry has seen equally significant developments in computer forensic tools where methods of searching for and detection of, malicious activity for presentation as evidence and provision of trust have become ever more sophisticated. To a considerable degree the science of security and forensics have seen both rapid but separate developments. This paper proposes that there are areas in common between these two important fields of endeavour and sets out techniques and ideas which demonstrate how they can overlap and work together in order to provide improved security and trustworthiness in critical infrastructures. In particular this paper addresses computer security and forensic analysis from a real-time perspective such that security events can be monitored in a live network while sound forensic data collection, storage and processing can be carried out in a manner which supports real-time security and at the same time still meeting the requirements of sound evidence.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593243","","Computer architecture;Computers;Fires;Forensics;Monitoring;Real time systems;Security","computer forensics;computer network security;government data processing;national security","computer forensic tools;computer security;critical infrastructure protection;e-discovery;intrusion detection techniques;law enforcement agencies;malicious activity detection;national security;network forensics;trustworthy network infrastructure","","2","","12","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to increasing number of Advanced Persistent Attacks such as malware, rootkit, spyware etc., virtual machine protection is highly challenging task. The key element of Advanced Persistent Threat is rootkit that provides stealthy control of underlining Operating System (kernel). Protecting individual guest operating system by using antivirus and commercial security defense mechanism is cost effective and ineffective for virtualized environment. To solve this problem, Virtual Machine Introspection has emerged as one of the promising approaches to secure the state of the virtual machine. Virtual Machine Introspection inspects the state of multiple virtual machines by operating outside the virtual machine i.e. at hypervisor level. In this work, Virtual Machine Introspection based malicious process detection approach is proposed. It extracts the high level information such as system call details, opened known backdoor ports from introspected memory to identify the spurious process. It triggers an alert in response to detected intrusion.","","978-1-4799-8432-9","","10.1109/ABLAZE.2015.7155003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155003","Hypervisor;Rootkit;Semantic Gap;Virtual Machine;Virtual Machine Introspection;Virtualization","Kernel;Malware;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtualisation","advanced persistent attacks;advanced persistent threat;antivirus;backdoor port;guest operating system protection;high level information;hypervisor level;intrusion detection;malicious process detection approach;malware;memory introspection;rootkit;security defense mechanism;spurious process detection;spyware;state inspection;stealthy control;system call details;underlining operating system kernel;virtual machine introspection;virtual machine protection;virtual machine state security;virtualized cloud computing environment;vulnerability exploitation","","0","","27","","","25-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally. The results show that used in intrusion detection, the new algorithm has higher identification rate and it can increase network running efficiency and the success rate of training. Thereby it can reduce undetected rate and false alarm rate. Thus it proves the validity of the new algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4638-4","978-1-4244-4639-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5302607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302607","","Biological neural networks;Computer network management;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Helium;Information security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Transfer functions","genetic algorithms;neural nets;security of data","GA-based WWN intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;identification rate;network running efficiency;network security;wavelet neural network","","0","","13","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rapid growth of web sites and web applications gives way to deliver complex business applications through the web. As the web dependency increases, so do the web hacking activities. Web applications are normally written in scripting languages like JavaScript, PHP embedded in HTML allowing connectivity to the databases, retrieving data and putting them in the WWW site. A web application is vulnerable to many kinds of threats and attacks. In order to detect known attacks, some set of attack rules and detections are needed. In this paper, a negative security model based on misuse of web applications is used. This negative security model provides a Web Application Firewall(WAF) engine with a rule set, to ensure critical protection across every web architecture. WAFs are deployed to establish an increased external security layer to detect and/or prevent attacks before they reach web applications. This paper has been tested with apache web server's log file. We have tested successfully almost all the common attacks. This paper also allows for HTTP traffic monitoring and real-time analysis with little or no changes to existing infrastructure.","","978-1-4244-7817-0","","10.1109/CISIM.2010.5643461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5643461","Web intrusion;attacker;cross-site scripting;logging;rule set;sql injection;web application firewall","Computer hacking;Databases;Fires;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Web server","Internet;authoring languages;computer crime;computer network security;ethical aspects;hypermedia;information retrieval","HTTP traffic monitoring;WWW;Web application firewall;Web server log profile;Web sites;anomaly detection;data retrieval;ethical hackers;hacking;negative security model;real-time analysis;scripting languages;threats;unethical hackers","","1","","11","","","8-10 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A central coordinator mobile agents architecture and neighborhood watch in virtual areas are two potential concepts that could overcome the limitation of existing models. In this work a coordinator association approach for mobile agent based IDS will be presented.

However, as the VMs from different customers are running on the same host, an attack to the management virtual machine will easily lead to the compromise of the guest VMs. Therefore, it is critical for a cloud computing system to ensure the trustworthiness of management VMs. To this end, we propose VMGuard, an integrity monitoring and detecting system for management virtual machines in a distributed environment. VMGuard utilizes a special VM, Guard Domain, which runs on each physical node to monitor the co-resident management VMs. The integrity measurements collected by the Guard Domains are sent to the VMGuard server for safe store and independent analysis. The experimental evaluation of a Xen-based prototype shows that VMGuard can quickly detect the root kit attacks while the performance overhead is low.","1521-9097","978-1-4244-9727-0","978-0-7695-4307-9","10.1109/ICPADS.2010.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695587","Integrity Monitoring;Remote I/O;Virtual Machine","","cloud computing;system monitoring;virtual machines","VMGuard server;cloud computing provider;cloud computing system;cloud providers;coresident management;detecting system;distributed environment;guard domain;independent analysis;integrity monitoring system;management virtual machine;virtual machines","","5","","25","","","8-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406","amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services","","","","4","","","","","Feb. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"
