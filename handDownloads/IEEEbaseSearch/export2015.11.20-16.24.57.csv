Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The acceptability and usability of Intrusion Detection Systems get seriously affected with the data in network traffic. A large number of false alarms mean a lot in terms of the acceptability of Intrusion Detection Systems[1].In this paper we consider the dataset with multi classes and propose the classification for each type of attacks in a separate layer.

That is, if a firewall prevents outside IP addresses from sending packets to an internal protected machine that is only accessible on the local network, our technique can still find the machine. We employ a novel TCP/IP side channel technique to achieve this. The technique uses side channels in “zombie” machines to learn information about the network from the perspective of a zombie. Unlike previous TCP/IP side channel techniques, our technique does not require a high packet rate and does not cause denial-of-service. We also make no assumptions about globally incrementing IPIDs, as do idle scans. This paper addresses two key questions about our technique: how many machines are there on the Internet that are hidden behind firewalls, and how common is ingress filtering that prevents our scan by not allowing spoofed IP packets into the network. We answer both of these questions, respectively, by finding 1,296 hidden machines and measuring that only 23.9% of our candidate zombie machines are on networks that perform ingress filtering.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218441","","IP networks;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Ports (Computers);Probes;Size measurement","IP networks;Internet;firewalls","IP addresses;IP identification;Internet measurement technique;TCP/IP side channel technique;firewalls;hidden machines;idle scans;original SYN;zombie machines","","0","","33","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A knowledge base is inconsistent iff no probability function satisfies it. We propose a new process that consistently infers information from such bases. Contrary to ordinary inference processes, ours tackles inconsistencies by trusting every single item of knowledge, where trust can be an application-specific parameter. Moreover, our inference process behaves common sensically when applied to a consistent knowledge base, since it coincides with the maximum entropy inference process. Besides, we provide new measures of inconsistency and similarity that deal with possibly inconsistent knowledge bases.

So it is an important issue that how to make the IP networks to be more resilient under faults and attacks, i.e., to improve their tolerance abilities for both fault and intrusion. However recently, most of the researches focus on only one of them, and decouple the survivability and security each other. According to the trust model in social networks, this paper proposes an efficient scheme which is resilient to both fault and intrusion based on trust relationship for IP networks. This scheme not only borrows the trust rating from the social links, but also qualitatively describes the relationships between the trust rating and the network behavior. Then, this paper analyses the scheme how to tolerate three known malicious behaviors, viz., self-faults, bad mouth attacks and conflict behavior attacks. Finally, our scheme can detect the malicious nodes fast and accurately and efficiently prevent these malicious behaviors in IP networks.","","978-4-88552-232-1","978-4-88552-231-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4773800","IP networks;fault-tolerant;intrusion-tolerant;resilient;trust-based","Cryptography;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Helium;IP networks;Mouth;Resilience;Robustness;Scalability;Social network services","IP networks;computer network reliability;telecommunication security","IP network faults;TSIPN model;malicious attacks;network survivability;social network security;trust-based resilient scheme","","0","","13","","","14-16 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, network devices, enterprise servers or personal computers are potential targets of these attacks. Current security solutions like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) and virtual private networks (VPN) are centralized solutions which rely mostly on the analyze of inbound network connections. This approach notably forgets the effects of a rogue station, whose communications cannot be easily controlled unless the administrators establish a global authentication policy using methods like 802.1x to control all network communications among each device. To the best of our knowledge, a distributed and easily manageable solution for the global security of an enterprise network does not exist. In this paper, we present a new approach to deploy a distributed security solution where communication between each device can be control in a collaborative manner. Indeed, each device has its own security rules, who can be shared and improved through exchanges with others devices. With this new approach, called grid of security, a community of devices ensures that a device is trustworthy and that communications between devices progress in respect of the control of the system policies. To support this approach, we present a new communication model that helps structuring the distribution of security services among the devices. Like this, we can secure both ad-hoc, local-area or enterprise networks in a decentralized manner, preventing the risk of a security breach in the case of a failure.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318979","distributed communication;grid design;security architecture","Authentication;Collaboration;Communication system control;Communication system security;Control systems;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Microcomputers;Network servers;Virtual private networks","grid computing;middleware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","authentication policy;distributed security solution;firewalls;grid of security;intrusion detection systems;network security;virtual private networks","","1","","17","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering factors such as intrusion detection latency and a variety of parameters for real-time, Semi-Markov evaluation model for survival assessment is established. Based on this model, relevant quantitative criteria are made to define the important indicators of survivability, such as integrity and availability, so as to validate intrusion detection capability and the survivability of real-time database. The three important factors of false alarm, detection rate and the intensity of attack are analyzed in detail by the TPC-C benchmark.

Third International Conference on","20080523","2008","","","610","617","In today's IT environments, there is an ever increasing demand for log file analysis solutions. Log files often contain important information about possible incidents, but inspecting the often large amounts of textual data is too time-consuming and tedious a task to perform manually. To address this issue, we propose a novel log file visualization technique called Histogram Matrix (HMAT). HMAT visualizes the content of a log file in order to enable a security administrator to efficiently spot anomalies. The system uses a combination of graphical and statistical techniques and allows even non-experts to interactively search for anomalous log messages. Contrary to other approaches, our proposal does not only work on certain special kinds of log files, but instead works on almost every textual log file. Additionally, the system allows to automatically generate security events if an anomaly is detected, similar to anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. This paper introduces HMAT, demonstrates its functionality using log files from a variety of services in real environments, and identifies strengths and limitations of the technique.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529398","","Availability;Data security;Data visualization;Event detection;Histograms;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection","data visualisation;matrix algebra;security of data;statistical analysis","anomaly detection;histogram matrix;interactive search;intrusion detection system;log file visualization;statistical technique","","1","","15","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method constructs a homogeneous Markov chain model to characterize the normal behavior of a privileged program, and associates the states of the Markov chain with the unique system calls in the training data. At the detection stage, the probabilities that the Markov chain model supports the system call sequences generated by the program are computed. A low probability indicates an anomalous sequence that may result from intrusive activities. Then a decision rule based on the number of anomalous sequences in a locality frame is adopted to classify the program's behavior. The method gives attention to both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and is especially suitable for on-line detection.

Wireless sensors have become an excellent tool for military applications involving intrusion detection, perimeter monitoring, information gathering and smart logistics support in an unknown deployed area. Since sensor networks are resource-constrained devices, their design needs to minimize efforts without compromising the task's integrity. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach for an intrusion detection based on the structure of naturally occurring events. With the acquired knowledge distilled from the self-organized criticality aspect of the deployment region, we apply a hidden Markov model. In other words, we let our sensor network adapt to the norm of the dynamics in its natural surroundings so that any unusual activities can be singled out.

Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this background, this paper proposes a third alternative that hybrids misuse and anomaly prevention.

Very relevant communication concepts have been investigated such as RF radio communication in the terra hertz band or molecular communication based on transmitter molecules. Yet, one question has not been considered so far and that is nano communication security, i.e., will it be possible to protect such systems from manipulation by malicious parties? Our objective is to provide some first insights into the security challenges and to highlight some of the open research challenges in this field. The main observation is that especially for molecular communication existing security and cryptographic solutions might not be applicable.

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of “self-driving” cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of “connected vehicles” (United States) or “cooperative ITS” (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting. We also raise awareness to generate discussion about these threats at this early stage in the development of vehicle automation systems.","1524-9050","","","10.1109/TITS.2014.2342271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899663","Automated vehicle;autonomous vehicle;cooperative automated vehicle;cyberattacks;security","Automation;Computer crime;Privacy;Safety;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","intelligent transportation systems;road safety;security of data","V2I/I2V;V2V;automation system safety;autonomous automated vehicles;connected vehicles;cooperative ITS;cooperative automated vehicle systems;cooperative automated vehicles;cyberattacks;intelligent transportation systems;self-driving cars;vehicle automation systems","","0","","48","","2014-09-16","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They are used for spamming, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information, and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for several reasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February 2011. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers. Its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure. This paper offers a detailed dissection of the botnet's scanning behavior, including general methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet behavior across the global Internet.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2297678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717049","Botnet;Internet background radiation;Internet telephony;Network Telescope;VoIP;communication system security;darknet;network probing;scanning","Animation;Geology;IP networks;Internet;Ports (Computers);Servers;Telescopes","IP networks;computer network security;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","IPv4 address space;SIP server;Sality botnet;UCSD Network Telescope;VoIP-related infrastructure;critical voice communications infrastructure;cyber-criminal activity;global Internet;horizontal scan;malware evolution;network scans;scanning strategy;stealth scanning strategies;traffic data;unsolicited traffic","","0","","68","","2014-01-20","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus, there is no guarantee that a routed communication path is free of malicious nodes that will not comply with the employed protocol and attempt to interfere the network operations. In this paper, we survey the problem of secure routing in ad hoc wireless networks, and discuss the related techniques of cryptographic key distribution. However, no matter how secure the routing protocol is, it is still possible that some nodes are compromised and become malicious. The presence of compromised nodes, especially in nodes that are communication bottlenecks, limit the effectiveness of the described secure routing protocols. We therefore consider the problem of intrusion detection for such nodes. The intrusion detection problem and some solutions are described in detail for a concrete queueing model of medium access. The extensions of the solutions to address the problem in more general scenarios are also discussed.","","0-7803-8140-8","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290203","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer science;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;queueing theory;routing protocols;telecommunication security","compromised nodes;concrete queueing model;cryptographic key distribution;intrusion detection problem;medium access;secure routing protocols;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","26","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we use the ns-2 network simulator to demonstrate the vulnerability of the MintRoute protocol to link quality attacks by a malicious node. We then propose a novel ""sequence number gap trick"" as a lightweight means to test for and detect the presence of a malicious attacker. The simulation results show that judicious use of the sequence number gap trick provides robust detection of malicious nodes, preserving the data delivery capabilities of the WSN.","","978-1-4244-7264-2","978-1-4244-7263-5","10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5535004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5535004","","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Simulation;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","","","","2","","11","","","14-17 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, anticipatory reasoning-reacting systems (ARRS) were proposed as a high secure system with the ability to defend against malice anticipatorily, however, until now, there is no concrete implementation of ARRS for security, as well as no evidence showing the practical usefulness of anticipatory computing for security. As a step towards to ideal secure systems, we designed and implemented an ARRS for malice defense, which can adapt to different application by configuring different information source, anticipatory model, and anticipatory actions. We also evaluated our system by KDD99 dataset and a case study of web server. This paper proposes what features ideal malice defense systems should have, points out the gap between current IDSs and ideal malice defense systems, shows why some advantages of ARRSs could contribute ideal malice defense systems, and presents and evaluates a practical implementation of ARRS for security.","2327-0586","978-1-4673-4997-0","","10.1109/ICSESS.2013.6615410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6615410","anticipatory computing;anticipatory reasoning-reacting system;intrusion detection system;malice defense system","Context modeling;Electronic mail;Face;Software","Internet;security of data","ARRS;KDD99 dataset;Web server;anticipatory actions;anticipatory reasoning reacting systems;computing malice;confidentiality;information security systems;information source;intrusion detection systems;malice anticipatorily;malice defense systems;secure system","","0","","55","","","23-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, the double-loop structure is improved by adding a certain length of transmission fiber in the start and end of each loop which enhances the linear relationship between amplitude and distance. Second, in order to enhance the SNR, a spectral subtraction pre-processing method is provided. Through the above methods, precise location of a disturbance is guaranteed.

These open environments cause WSN to be more vulnerable to various wireless hackinglike spoofing jamming and broadcast attack. Securing a WSN from these attacks is a challenging task. Denial of Service (DoS) attack is one of the major security attacks in WSN. Jamming a single or cluster of nodes is a type of DoS attack on WSN. In this paper, a novel approach in detecting the physical layer DoS style jamming attack is proposed and analyzed. Here, we propose a method called physical layer jamming identification. This method is based on residual energy where few nodes are marked as monitor nodes. These nodes monitor the jamming attack by checking the Receiver Signal Strength Indicator and packet delivery ratio values of other nodes. It improves system performance and increases packet deliver ratio.","","978-1-4673-2922-4","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449882","Denial of service attack;Jamming attack;Wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;Jamming;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;jamming;radio receivers;wireless sensor networks","DoS style jamming attack detection;WSN;broadcast attack;catalyst;computer networks;denial of service attack;environmental monitoring;military surveillance;open environments;outdoor applications;packet delivery ratio values;physical layer jamming identification;receiver signal strength indicator;residual energy;wireless hackinglike spoofing jamming;wireless sensor network","","0","","16","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a traffic prediction model based on gene expression programming (GEP-ADS) is proposed, to predict the time series of normal traffic. Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS. The simulation results show that our ADS is able to achieve high detection accuracy with a low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283101","","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Gene expression;Hidden Markov models;Mathematics;Predictive models;Programming profession;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","genetic algorithms;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;time series;wireless sensor networks","GEP-ADS algorithm;GEP-based lightweight anomaly detection scheme;WSN trust;energy constraint;energy consumption;gene expression programming;intrusion detection scheme;routing attack;security model;simulation result;time series method;traffic prediction model;wired network;wireless sensor network reliability","","0","","16","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the number of security vulnerabilities grows every day, not the same thing can be said about the number of defense methods. But the most delicate problem in the information security domain remains detecting unknown attacks known as zero-day attacks. This paper presents methods for isolating the malicious traffic by using a honeypot system and analyzing it in order to automatically generate attack signatures for the Snort intrusion detection/prevention system. The honeypot is deployed as a virtual machine and its job is to log as much information as it can about the attacks. Then, using a protected machine, the logs are collected remotely, through a safe connection, for analysis.

CPINDEX installs appropriate cyber-side instrumentation probes on individual host systems to dynamically capture and profile low-level system activities such as interprocess communications among operating system assets. CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system. Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state.

One way to keep the quiescent current low is to replace conventional electronic systems like an intrusion detection system by an energy autonomous one. The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient. Power consumption of the proposed wireless sensor network is computed and compared with other wireless networks employing different types of ALOHA MAC layer protocols for handling sporadic traffic without significant control overhead.","","978-1-4673-1590-6","978-1-4673-1589-0","10.1109/SSD.2012.6198098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198098","Wireless sensor networks;automotive;energy autonomous","Base stations;Glass;Media Access Protocol;Power demand;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;automotive electronics;energy conservation;energy harvesting;mobile radio;power consumption;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","ALOHA;ASYMOF;MAC layer protocol;automobile safety system;built-in safety feature;electronic system;energy autonomous microsystems with mechanical energy harvester for mobile;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;network traffic handling;parking garage;power consumption;wireless energy autonomous sensor network","","0","","8","","","20-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, developing the network applications on network processors is not easy. How to efficiently program multiple processing elements and utilize various memory modules as well as the hardware resources on network processors are always challenges. In this paper, we investigate several optimization issues and programming techniques that should be considered by the developers to achieve higher packet processing rate on network processors. We use an existing packet classification scheme called hierarchical binary prefix search (HBPS) as the benchmark to test and evaluate these optimization techniques.

Since these resources are installed to displace carbon-based generation and to provide an income stream to the resource owner, it is important that both installation objectives (as a minimum) can be met. With all of these renewable energy resources available, the opportunity also exists to assist with the energy management of this resource-rich distribution network. However, the renewable energy resources do not produce power in a deterministic manner. The available production depends on the time of day and many other environmental factors. Accordingly, a system that is able to program and coordinate the production and storage of power in a distribution network would be of benefit to the network operator. This paper presents a multiagent system (MAS) that is responsible for the management of renewable energy resources and power storage systems connected to the distribution network of a zone substation. The MAS manages the orderly connection and disconnection of resources using a plug and play algorithm in order to minimize disturbances to the supply-and-demand balance within the distribution network. The proposed MAS design is validated using a network based on the IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The results obtained through computer simulation show that with the MAS, it is possible to manage the power resources so that there is minimal power drawn from the upstream network during periods of high demand.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2363844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6951478","Energy management;plug and play (PnP);reinforcement learning (RL);smart grid;team formation","Australia;Availability;Nickel;Renewable energy sources;Smart grids;Standards;Substations","distribution networks;energy management systems;environmental factors;multi-agent systems;smart power grids;substations","DVF;IEEE 34-bus test feeder;MAS;carbon based generation;distributed value function;distribution networks;energy balance;energy management;environmental factors;installation objectives;multiagent system;power storage systems;renewable energy resources;smart grid;supply-and-demand balance;zone substation","","0","","43","","2014-11-10","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software. As part of the Symerton project, we propose using virtualization to address these issues. We have designed a system that has a virtual machine dedicated to high-performance networking, and a virtual machine dedicated to hosting non-performance critical tasks in a general-purpose operating system. Using a proof-of-concept implementation, we show that the resulting system outperforms a general-purpose operating system by an average of 22% for a real networking application. We also discuss tradeoffs that will need to be considered in further development of systems using this design.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579531","communications systems;networking;virtualization","Acceleration;Application software;Buildings;Cryptography;Hardware;Operating systems;Sockets;Software libraries;Virtual machining;XML","computer networks;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","ASIC;Symerton project;XML processing;network processors;operating systems;packet processing complexity;proof-of-concept implementation;service provider networks;virtual machine","","0","6","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection system is an indispensable part of computer and network forensics. It is deployed to monitor network and host activities including dataflows and information accesses etc. But current intrusion detection products presents many flaws including alert flooding, too many false alerts and isolated alerts etc. We describe an ongoing project to develop an intrusion alert management system $TRINETR. We present a collaborative architecture design for multiple intrusion detection systems to work together to detect real-time network intrusions. The architecture is composed of three parts: alert aggregation, knowledge-based alert evaluation and alert correlation. The architecture is aimed at reducing the alert overload by aggregating alerts from multiple sensors to generate condensed views, reducing false positives by integrating network and host system information into alert evaluation process and correlating events based on logical relations to generate global and synthesized alert report. The first two parts of the architecture have been implemented and the implementation results are presented.","1524-4547","0-7695-2183-5","","10.1109/ENABL.2004.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1376839","","Collaborative work;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Floods;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Network synthesis;Project management;Real time systems;Sensor systems","computer crime;computer network management;monitoring;telecommunication security","TRINETR intrusion detection alert management systems;alert aggregation;alert correlation;alert flooding;collaborative architecture design;computer forensics;cyber attacks;false alerts;isolated alerts;knowledge-based alert evaluation;multiple intrusion detection systems;network forensics;network monitoring;real-time network intrusion detection","","6","","22","","","14-16 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is the process of monitoring and analyzing network traffic data to detect security violations. Mining approach can play very important role in developing an intrusion detection system. The network traffic can be classified into normal and anomalous in order to detect intrusions. In our paper, top-ten classification algorithms namely J48, BayesNet, Logistic, SGD, IBK, JRip, PART, Random Forest, Random Tree and REPTree were selected after experimenting with more than twenty most widely used classification algorithms. The comparison of these top-ten classification algorithms is presented in this paper based upon their performance metrics to find out the best suitable algorithm available. Performance of the classification models is measured using 10-fold cross validation. Experiments and assessments of these methods are performed in WEKA environment using NSL-KDD dataset.","","978-0-7695-5066-4","","10.1109/ISCBI.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724320","Classification;Data mining;Intrusion Detection;NSL-KDD;WEKA","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Vegetation","Bayes methods;computer network security;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","BayesNet algorithm;IBK algorithm;J48 algorithm;JRip algorithm;NSL-KDD dataset;PART algorithm;REPTree algorithm;SGD algorithm;WEKA environment;anomalous network traffic;classification technique;comparative study;intrusion detection system;logistic algorithm;mining approach;network security;network traffic data analysis;network traffic data monitoring;normal network traffic;random forest algorithm;random tree algorithm","","4","","23","","","24-26 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200273","Anomaly detection;least squares;online updating;oversampling;principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Data models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Memory management;Principal component analysis","","","","4","","26","","2012-05-15","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Not only it provides various services to users (e.g. calls, instant messaging, internet conferencing etc), but it is also in a process of extending services (e.g. fax service). Due to the open environment of packet switched network, the signaling protocols (such as SIP and H.323) and the transport protocols (e.g. RTP and SRTP) used by VoIP, it is prone to unwanted accesses and does not comply with the security standards. VoIP is also vulnerable to threats from TCP/IP and UDP. Furthermore, the malicious users can exhaust proxy and end users with INIVTE flooding in SIP. In order to overcome these challenging issues, we propose a simple and robust method to detect INVITE flooding on the SIP proxy server by a strategic proxy model that is based on a user-specified threshold. This model is based on the traffic pattern of normal VoIP traffic and the attacked traffic pattern. Unlike considering only stateful proxies, our model is works for both stateless and stateful proxies.","","978-1-4244-9539-9","","10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982572","","Computer crime;Estimation;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers","IP networks;Internet telephony;packet switching;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","H.323;INIVTE flooding;SIP proxy server;SRTP;TCP/IP;UDP;VoIP technology;attacked traffic pattern;end users;flooding attack;malicious users;normal VoIP traffic;packet switched network;security standards;signaling protocols;stateful proxy;stateless proxy;strategic proxy model;strategy based proxy;transport protocols;unwanted accesses;user agent;user-specified threshold;voice over IP technology","","4","","18","","","4-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After we carefully research on network topological architecture and scan attack method and mechanism, we find that scan attack always happened at network layer and transport layer. Then we propose a scan detection method based on distributed cooperative model. It is composed of feature-based detection, scenario-based detection and statistic-based detection.

Occurrence and spread of attack induced failure imply that hosts once trusted cannot remain equally trusted all the time. System components and human operators can benefit from a scheme that assesses the trustworthiness of hosts i.e., the confidence that individual hosts are not corrupt, on a continuous basis by adjusting and adapting their behavior when a host's trustworthiness diminishes.

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","0","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firewalls provide a false sense of security because they have inherent flaws that are continuously exploited by hackers. Current firewalls lack in providing adequate security against insiders. Literature suggests that these limitations arise from the deficiencies in firewall design. This paper presents a model of a firewall called disarming firewall. The model is composed of different components, each serving different purpose. The firewall protects against malicious insiders by limiting the attacking capabilities of each internal host. Knowing that obtaining knowledge of end systems is a precursor of an attack, the firewall hides the identity of OS and server software placed in DMZ from internal as well as external users. Another problem solved by the firewall is the general laziness in applying patches to the software. The auditing system of firewall actively monitors all systems in the perimeter and applies patches as soon as they are released.","","978-1-4244-8001-2","","10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625739","Disarmed Host;Firewall;Network Security","Authentication;Fires;Internet;Monitoring;Servers;Software","authorisation;computer crime;operating systems (computers)","auditing system;disarming firewall;hackers;network security;operating system;server software","","0","","22","","","14-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently data mining and state transition analysis are becoming important components in identifying intrusions. This paper proposes a semantic based intrusion detection scheme where state transition analysis, pattern matching and data mining techniques are integrated to maximize the detection accuracy. Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder. Implementations prove that the proposed hybrid intrusion detection scheme can accurately detect an intruder with the help of a wired network and an appropriate database.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972244","ANTLR;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Grammar;Image sensors;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Radiofrequency identification;Semantics","computer network security;data mining;pattern matching;wireless sensor networks","ANTLR tool;WSN;data mining technique;data streaming;hybrid intrusion detection scheme;metamorphosed;pattern matching;semantic based intrusion detection scheme;semantic rules;spatial domain;state transition analysis;surveillance system;time domain","","1","","19","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
