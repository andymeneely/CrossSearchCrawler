Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is in operation in Industries, Govt. organization, Banks to guard mission critical data from fraudulent access and tempering. In recent years, with the explosion of Internet, the number of attacks in computer networks is constantly increasing. This is primarily due to the lack of proper authentication of communicating entities in the network. Moreover, the different layer of network is prone to various threats due to vulnerabilities in each of its layers. The layers are independent of each other in functionality and the lower layers provide service to the upper layers. So any compromise in a lower layer will affect all layers above it without the knowledge of the higher layers. So the attacks needs to be classified in layered fashion and their mitigation technique needs to be developed layer wise which means, modern IDS system should also needs to be designed in layered fashion. In this talk, a brief overview of layered approach to Intrusion detection system will be presented by identifying different attacks at different layers in the Internet protocol stack. The need of multiple IDSs for protection of systems will also be discussed.","","978-1-4244-9578-8","","10.1109/NCETACS.2011.5751372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751372","","","Internet;computer network security;protocols","Internet protocol stack;attack mitigation technique;intrusion detection system;network layer specific attack","","0","","","","","4-5 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these disasters, it is very important to detect the occurrence of them as soon as possible, and evacuate people quickly. To cope with these issues, the authors are developing ERESS (Emergency Rescue Evacuation Support System). ERESS is based on Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANET) and aims to reduce the number of victims in panic-type disasters. This system consists of new mobile terminals (handset size) with advanced disaster recognition algorithm and acquires sensor information such as acceleration, direction difference and walking steps. Collected information about them is used for detecting the occurrence of a disaster. However, until now, there is no suitable information spreading method for ERESS to collect their information effectively. In this paper we propose three information spreading methods which are suitable for ERESS. The proposed methods are a TTL (Time To Live) control, a transmission power control, and an integrated method using separated sectors. We show the validity of the proposed methods by computer simulations.","","978-1-4673-3071-8","978-1-4673-3069-5","10.1109/ITST.2012.6425277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425277","ERESS;MANET;Panic-type Disasters;TTL","Ad hoc networks;Computer simulation;Delay;Flowcharts;Mobile communication;Power control;Power demand","disasters;emergency services;mobile ad hoc networks;power control;telecommunication terminals","ERESS;MANET;TTL control;advanced disaster recognition algorithm;chemical explosion;computer simulations;earthquakes;emergency rescue evacuation support system;fires;mobile ad-hoc networks;mobile terminals;multihop information spreading methods;panic- type disasters;sensor information;terrorisms;time to live control;transmission power control","","1","","6","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main reason for using data mining techniques for intrusion detection systems is due to the enormous volume of existing and newly appearing network data that require processing. The amount of data accumulated each day by a network is huge. Several data mining techniques such as clustering, classification, and association rules are proving to be useful for gathering different knowledge for intrusion detection.

Consumer electronic devices have evolved depending on user needs. Users want to use compact and portable devices such as cellular phones, laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. anywhere and at anytime to download multimedia data or to access realtime traffic. The mobile Ad Hoc networks have several salient characteristics, such as Dynamic topologies, Bandwidth-constrained, Variable capacity links, Energy-constrained operation and Limited physical security. Due to these features, mobile Ad Hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks launched through compromised node. The communication in mobile AdHoc networks comprises of two phases, the route discovery and the data transmission. In a hostile environment, adversarial nodes can try to disrupt communication in both the two phases. However, consumer electronic devices generally operate on limited battery power and therefore are vulnerable to security threats like data flooding attacks. Flooding attack is a novel and powerful attack against on-demand Ad Hoc routing protocols. At present, FAP (Flooding Attack Prevention) is the single scheme proposed to resist such attack. But it may not give quality of service. In this paper, we present a Period Based Defense mechanism against data flooding attack in wireless AdHoc network. This is the new technique to defend the flooding attack. This scheme is based on the periods and uses a blacklist to efficiently prevent the data flooding attack. The main aim of this paper is to enhance the throughput of burst traffic. As a result of which, many data packets are forwarded at a high rate for the whole duration. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme enhances the throughput of burst traffic.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726662","Data flooding attack;burst traffic;throughput;wireless ad hoc network","Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Quality of service;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","PDA;adversarial nodes;bandwidth-constrained variable capacity links;battery power;burst traffic;cellular phones;compromised node;consumer electronic devices;data flooding attacks;data packets;data transmission;denial of service attacks;dynamic topologies;energy-constrained operation;flooding attack prevention;hostile environment;laptop computers;limited physical security;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile users;multimedia data;on-demand ad hoc routing protocols;period based defense mechanism;personal digital assistants;quality of service;realtime traffic;route discovery;security threats;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","5","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of secure manor introduced, all sophisticated traffics of user are protected in a close operating environment and go on in security. We describe the principle of secure vault and how to implement such model. Especially, we detail the structure of secure manor, which is the core of our model. Finally, the performance is discussed by an experiment.","","978-0-7695-3073-4","","10.1109/CISW.2007.4425553","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4425553","","Computational intelligence;Computer security;Educational institutions;Filters;Hip;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Traffic control","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","Internet;cyber attack;end user;intrusion prevention system;public open network environment;secure vault model","","0","","7","","","15-19 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed method, intrusion detection is performed not with all the fragment packets but with partial fragment packets. If the fragment packet comes, the packet-matching-buffer containing the partial part of the previous fragment packet and this packet is merged into a packet-matching-buffer. After this work, pattern matching for this buffer is done. Finally, for the purpose of the next packet, the partial region of the current packet is stored into the packet-matching-buffer. With the help of these steps, there are two advantages. The one is that it doesn't need to re-assemble all fragment packets for intrusion detection. The other is that the size of buffer can be smaller than all fragment packet re-assembly and can be predictable as a constant size. The proposed method can be used efficiently to prevent malicious code of attackers for avoiding intrusion detection system","","89-5519-129-4","","10.1109/ICACT.2006.205933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625538","Fragment Packet;Intrusion Detection;Partial Re-assembly","Assembly;Buffer storage;Change detection algorithms;Delay;Intrusion detection;Merging;Pattern matching","pattern matching;security of data","fragment packet partial reassembly method;intrusion detection;malicious attacker code;packet-matching-buffer;partial fragment packets;pattern matching","","0","1","13","","","20-22 Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since current approaches to detecting network intrusions rely on associating individual network actions the temporal distribution of an attack throughout a network makes it extremely difficult to accurately identify the intrusion. This paper describes an approach to detecting temporally distributed attacks based on a modified Hierarchical Quilted Self-Organizing Map (HQSOM). The HQSOM approach emulates some aspects of biological neural networks by distributing the reasoning capability throughout a hierarchical structure. The approach described here combines an adaptive learning parameter with variable spatial and temporal clustering to associate the components of the attack.

Most of the recent research on intrusion detection systems for wireless attacks either focuses on just one layer of observation or uses a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. The goal of this study is to detect injection types of attacks in wireless networks by fusing multi-metrics using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief theory. When combining beliefs, an important step to consider is the automatic and self-adaptive process of basic probability assignment (BPA). This study presents a comparison between manual and automatic BPA methods using the D-S technique. Custom tailoring BPAs in an optimum manner under specific network conditions could be extremely time consuming and difficult. In contrast, automatic methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior training or calibration from an administrator. The results show that multi-layer techniques perform more efficiently when compared with conventional methods. In addition, the automatic assignment of beliefs makes the use of such a system easier to deploy while providing a similar performance to that of a manual system.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687157","","","computer network security;inference mechanisms;probability;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling;wireless LAN","802.11 attacks;D-S belief theory;Dempster-Shafer belief theory;automatic assigned thresholds;basic probability assignment;custom tailoring BPA;manual assigned thresholds;multilayer data fusion intrusion detection system;multimetrics;self-adaptive process;wireless attacks;wireless networks","","1","","","","","Jan. 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we present a new cluster based intrusion detection algorithm that takes care of black hole attacks in a MANET. This proposed algorithm is based on trustworthiness of the nodes in a network. The network is considered to be a layered structured. The nodes are member of a cluster. Each cluster has cluster head that takes care of all the members of its own cluster and communicates with cluster head at layer 2 whenever required. The cluster head at layer 2 communicate with all cluster head at layer 1. The selection of cluster head depends on three parameters battery power, mobility and trust value of a node in a cluster. Periodically the cluster head updation is done according to three parameters. We have implemented our algorithm using the NS simulator.

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, the term `bad character' is a character that causes a mismatch. While checking multiple bytes in scanning the text at a time, the BLAST algorithm overcomes the reduction of the average shift value in a typical search, which is caused by the dependency on the multi-byte search unit (MBSU) and the large frequency of the last character of the given patterns. From the theoretical analysis, the authors validate the correctness of the BLAST algorithm. Also, from the experimental results across different setups, the authors show that the BLAST algorithm provides the faster search time than the other algorithms. For example, the authors obtain an enhancement by as much as 212.41% on average for various numbers of attack patterns and attack traffic conditions compared with that of the modified Wu-Manber algorithm. In addition, it is shown that the BLAST algorithm drastically reduces the amount of memory required for constructing the shift table based on a MBSU from 64 KB to 1 KB.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2011.0305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587875","","","computer network security;search problems;string matching;text analysis","B-layered bad-character SHIFT tables;BLAST algorithm;MBSU;Wu-Manber algorithm;attack patterns;attack traffic conditions;byte checking;high-speed pattern matching;multibyte search unit;multipattern matching algorithm;pattern search time;shift values;single bad-character SHIFT table;single-byte search unit;space-time tradeoff;text scanning","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a χ<sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %. These results show promise for the use of MAID in early DOS detection using MIB traffic parameters.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232401","","Computer crime;Computer displays;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Prototypes;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;neural nets;probability;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","χ<sup>2</sup> test;AKS;CST;DOS computer network attacks;DOS intrusion detection;Denial of Service;FDM;KKS;KS type statistic;KST;Kolmogorov-Smyrnov test;MAID;MIB traffic parameters;PDF;SNMP;anomaly status vector;combined area-KS type test;early detection;fractional deviation from mean statistic;misclassification rates;multiobservation-window;network testbed facility;neural network classifier;probability density function;similarity metrics;statistical anomaly intrusion detection;traffic intensity scenarios","","13","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection parameters are numerous and in many cases they present uncertain and imprecise causal relationships which can affect attack types. A Bayesian Network (BN) is known as graphical modeling tool used to model decision problems containing uncertainty. In this paper, a BN is used to build automatic intrusion detection system based on signature recognition. A major difficulty of this system is that the uncertainty on parameters can have two origins. The first source of uncertainty comes from the uncertain character of information due to a natural variability resulting from stochastic phenomena. The second source of uncertainty is related to the imprecise and incomplete character of information due to a lack of knowledge. The goal of this work is to propose a method to propagate both the stochastic and the epistemic uncertainties, coming respectively from the uncertain and imprecise character of information, through the Bayesian model, in an intrusion detection context.","","978-1-4244-4171-6","978-1-4244-4173-0","10.1109/ISI.2009.5137285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137285","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Context modeling;Intrusion detection;Marine vehicles;Protection;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Tellurium;Uncertainty","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;stochastic processes","Bayesian network;epistemic uncertainty;graphical modeling tool;hybrid propagation;intrusion detection;learning;model decision problem;signature recognition;stochastic phenomena","","0","","15","","","8-11 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The communications between nodes are multihop, and provided in a decentralized way without preexisting infrastructure. These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks. Based on simulation results, our filters prove that these attacks can be detected with a high rate of accuracy.","","","","10.1109/SCVT.2014.7046699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046699","","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","Bayes methods;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian filter;Bernoulli filter;DoS attack detection;MANET;blackhole attack;denial of service attack detection;grayhole attack;intrusion detection mechanism;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless entity;multinomial filter;packet dropping attack detection;reactive routing protocol;received packet drop;route discovery phase;self-organized network;watchdog;wormhole attack","","0","","13","","","10-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management protocol with a trust-based service composition application. Our results indicate that trust-based service composition significantly outperforms non-trust-based (random) service composition and its performance approaches the maximum achievable performance with global knowledge.","","978-1-4673-1238-7","978-1-4673-1237-0","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263792","Internet of things;Trust management;performance analysis;social networks","Accuracy;Communities;Convergence;Internet;Protocols;Quality of service;Security","Internet;computer network reliability;computer network security;protocols;trusted computing","Internet of Things;IoT;community-interest;cooperativeness;direct observations;false recommendation attacks;global knowledge;heterogeneous network environments;honesty;human-carried devices;human-operated devices;indirect recommendations;malicious nodes;maximum achievable performance;reliability management;scalable trust management protocol;smart objects;social encounter event;social interaction event;social relationships;trust aggregation;trust assessment accuracy;trust convergence time;trust evaluation;trust parameters;trust properties;trust-based service composition application","","1","","20","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel self-organized key revocation scheme based on the Dirichlet multinomial model and identity-based cryptography (IBC). Our key revocation scheme offers a theoretically sound basis for a node in MANETs to predict the behavior of other nodes based on its own observations and reports from peers. In our scheme, each node keeps track of three categories of behavior defined and classified by an external trusted authority, and updates its knowledge about other nodespsila behavior with 3-dimension Dirichlet distribution. Differentiating between suspicious behavior and malicious behavior enables nodes to make multilevel response by either revoking keys of malicious nodes or ceasing the communication with suspicious nodes for some time to gather more information for making further decision. Furthermore, we also analyze the attack-resistant properties of our key revocation scheme through extensive simulations in the presence of adversaries.","","978-1-4244-2412-2","978-1-4244-2413-9","10.1109/LCN.2008.4664309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664309","","Analytical models;Bayesian methods;Identity-based encryption;Information analysis;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Packaging;Peer to peer computing;Public key;Public key cryptography","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio","Dirichlet multinomial model;attack-resistant properties;identity-based cryptography;key revocation;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;multilevel response;self-organized key revocation scheme","","0","2","22","","","14-17 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of the major techniques for network security protection, such as virtual private networks (VPN), firewalls, and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), are all dependent on the speed and ability of packet classification. The complexity of multi-dimensional packet classification will result in large scale rule-sets, which makes it prohibitive for software implementation. Algorithms based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) can solve this problem but cause entries expansion during the range matching. Our paper introduces a new region encoding mechanism of range mapping which can eliminate the expansion. By adding a new regional code, which is used to encode the ranges spanning two regions or more, the improved mechanism is able to express all the ranges by only one entry. Simulation and characteristics analysis of real rule-sets verify this encoding mechanism's feasibility and efficiency in actual applications.","","978-0-7695-3932-4","978-1-4244-5467-9","10.1109/FCST.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5392861","TCAM;entry expansion;packet classification;range matching","Computer science;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;National security;Protection;Quality of service;Routing;Virtual private networks;Wide area networks","computer network security;content-addressable storage;encoding;pattern matching","TCAM;encoding mechanism;entries expansion;network security protection;packet classification;range matching;ternary content addressable memory","","0","","14","","","17-19 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design a model-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for sensor networks used for PCS. Given that PCS tends to have regular traffic patterns and a well-defined request-response communication, we can design an IDS that models normal behavior of the entities and detects attacks when there is a deviation from this model.

Characterizing the service times of network IDSs is a crucial step in improving their real time performance. We analyzed about 41 million packets organized in five data sets of 10 minutes each collected at the entry point of a large production network and processed by Snort, a commonly used IDS. The processing times of the three main stages in Snort were measured. The main conclusions of our study were: (1) rule checking accounts for about 75% of the total processing time in IDSs, with mean pay load checking time being 4.5 times larger than mean header checking time. (2) The distribution of rule checking limes is markedly bimodal, a direct consequence of the bimodality in packet composition in current high speed Internet traffic. (3) Header processing times have a small variance and small correlation coefficients. (4) In contrast, the distribution of payload processing times displays high variance, in a form that can be generally characterized as ""slightly heavy-tailed"". Explicitly, payload processing times have a lognormal upper tail, clipped at the top 1%. This extreme 1% upper tail is better fit by an exponential distribution. (5) Additionally, payload processing times were shown to be highly correlated, with correlation coefficients several orders of magnitude higher than the confidence bands for the standard whiteness test. The impact of these findings in the design of IDSs for real time operation in networks is discussed, and compared with existing results for processing times for Unix processes, which were shown to display pronounced heavy-tailed characteristics.","0191-2216","0-7803-8682-5","","10.1109/CDC.2004.1428609","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1428609","","Data security;Displays;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Production;Statistical distributions","Internet;exponential distribution;information systems;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;Snort;Unix processes;exponential distribution;lognormal upper tail;network intrusion detection system;payload processing times;security violations;statistical distribution","","14","","24","","","14-17 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multiagent-based abstraction layer is responsible for converting the row security policy into specific configuration profiles or scripts that can be used to configure different security products. This scenario eliminates the difficulty of configuring and implementing a given security policy.

A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies.

Data packets are dispersed and transmitted simultaneously through the reliable disjoint paths. The primary reliable path sends the information packet containing the transmission information. At the destination, if there is mismatch between the transmission information and the data packets received, a negative feedback is sent back to the source that includes the particulars of the affected paths. The affected paths are then removed from the list of node-disjoint paths by the source. The destination can recover the data effectively by attaining reliability, since the data packets are dispersed along multiple paths using an efficient dispersion algorithm. Our simulation result shows that, when compared with existing scheme, our framework reduces overhead and delay, at the same time increasing the packet delivery ratio.","","978-1-4244-3594-4","978-1-4244-3595-1","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787688","Detection;Dispersion;Malicious;Multipath;Reliable","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Dispersion;Intrusion detection;Isolation technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Routing;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;data forwarding operations;dispersion techniques;efficient dispersion algorithm;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath reliable routing algorithm;negative feedback;network layer security solution;node-disjoint reliable paths;packet delivery ratio;reliability index;security attacks","","3","","17","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such algorithms are widely used for testing intrusion detection systems. We investigate the notion of completeness of a mutation algorithm: its capability to generate all possible attack instances from a given set of attack transformations. We define the notion of a Phi-complete mutation algorithm. Given a set of transformations Phi, an algorithm is complete with respect to Phi, if it can generate every instance that the transformations in Phi derive. We show that if the rules in Phi are uniform and reversible then a Phi-complete algorithm exists. Intuitively speaking, uniform and reversible transformations mean that we can first exclusively apply transformations that simplify the attack, then exclusively apply transformations that complicate it, and still get all possible instances that are derived by the rules in Phi. Although uniformity and reversibility may appear severe restrictions, we show that common attack transformations are indeed uniform and reversible. Therefore, our Phi-complete algorithm can be incorporated into existing testing tools for intrusion detection systems. Furthermore, we show that a Phi-complete algorithm is useful, not only for testing purposes, but also for determining whether two packet traces are two different mutations of the same attack","1063-6900","0-7695-2615-2","","10.1109/CSFW.2006.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1648707","","Computer security;Conferences;Encoding;Feeds;Genetic mutations;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;System testing;TCPIP;Uniform resource locators","security of data","Phi-complete mutation algorithm;attack mutation algorithms;attack transformations;intrusion detection systems;reversible transformations;transformations Phi;uniform transformations","","0","13","29","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The customization of routers introduces increased vulnerabilities and attacks that allow potential attackers to compromise the router. Since network routers play a key role in todays network data transport, they became an interesting targets for attackers. An attacker can mount different attacks like denial-of-service or man-in-the-middle by intelligently dropping, modifying or diverting packets arriving at a compromised router. In this paper, we considered the problem of detecting packet modification attack which is performed by an attacker through misbehaving router. Since it is necessary to differentiate malicious packet modification from regular packet modification, detecting such an attack is challenging task. We proposed a controller-based packet modification misbehavior detection technique that excellently detects malicious packet modification by using a hash-based comparison of incoming and outgoing packets of the router. Experiments were carried out using Mininet Simulator and based on the results obtained, we observe that our proposed technique unambiguously detects the malicious packet modification.","","978-1-4799-3485-0","","10.1109/CNSC.2014.6906649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906649","","IP networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Software;Switches","Internet;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols","Internet supports;Mininet simulator;computer networks;controller-based packet modification misbehavior detection technique;denial of service attacks;diverting packets;dropping packets;hash-based comparison;heterogeneous applications;malicious packet modification;man-in-the-middle;misbehaving router;modifying packets;network data transport;network routers;packet modification attack detection;programmable packet processors;protocols applications;regular packet modification","","0","","11","","","19-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many techniques have been developed that can address known attacks and similar new attacks that may arise in the future. Some methods, like Earlybird and Polygraph, focus on string-based content prevalence in payloads; others focus on the presence of particular I386 instructions, e.g., Sigfree counts the number of ldquousefulrdquo instructions in each request. For both types of systems, a white-listing mechanism, in which some strings or instructions are regarded as innocuous, is necessary to avoid a high false positive rate associated with common content such as URL addresses and peer-to-peer traffic. In this paper, we explore a more sophisticated attack model that not only makes malcode payloads look like nominal ones, but which is also assumed to be both aware of and exploitative of the white-listing itself in forming a Trojan mechanism. In other words, the malware attempts to embed its malcode into the prevalent content that is normally white-listed. If the malcode is encrypted, the attacker will also attempt to obfuscate its plain-text decryption code as much as possible. Both current string-based and instructionbased systems will likely fail to detect such attacks. We propose a comprehensive IDS model in the paper and discuss some potential defensive mechanisms against such attack.","","978-1-4244-2483-2","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567340","","Computer networks;Computer worms;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Embedded computing;Humans;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Payloads","cryptography;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","IDS model;Trojan mechanism;URL addresses;code obfuscation;covert malware modeling;encryption;generalized suffix tree;network defenses;payload-based detection;peer-to-peer traffic;string-based content prevalence;white-listing mechanism;zero-day attacks","","0","1","35","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The property of “full-healing” is not only focused on registered-session recovery as most self-healing or mutual-healing group key distribution schemes, it enables an authorized group member to recover entire key chain for the historical sessions. We give a formal definition of the “full-healing” and introduce technical details and properties of the F-GKD schemes.

But existing studies mostly considered statistical network flow attributes such as packet size distributions, for that there arenpsilat so far efficient solutions to extract signatures based on application-level content. The association rules algorithm may be the key to solve the problem, but itpsilas unavailable while itemset is a permutation of items or transaction is a set of itemsets. Aiming at this problem, the paper provides a signatures extracting algorithm based on offset constraint, which present the notion of Sequence Itemset and Offset Attribute Set, remedying the defect of association rules algorithm. The results indicate that signatures extracted by this approach is highly accurate for apply to online application identification.","","978-0-7695-3505-0","","10.1109/IITA.Workshops.2008.152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731895","Application Identification;Offset Constraint;Sequence Itemset;Signatures Extracting","Association rules;Data analysis;Data mining;Information technology;Itemsets;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;handwriting recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;statistical analysis","application-level content;application-level identification approach;application-level signatures extracting algorithm;association rules algorithm;machine learning;network data analysis;offset attribute set;offset constraint;packet size distributions;sequence itemset;statistical network flow attributes","","0","","10","","","21-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a secure wireless sensor based intelligent traffic system which aims to use fuzzy logic to alleviate heavy traffic conditions.

In this work, it is presented an evaluation of Rényi and Tsallis entropy performances compared with Shannon entropy in order to obtain an optimal attribute subset that increase the capability of the Intrusion Detection System to classify the traffic as normal or as suspicious.

Virus scanning is usually performed on email, Web and file transfer traffic flows at intranet security gateways. The performance of popular anti-virus applications relies on the pattern matching algorithms implemented in these security devices. The growth of network bandwidth and the increase of virus signatures call for high speed and scalable pattern matching algorithms. Motivated by several observations of a real-life virus signature database from Clam-AV, a popular antivirus application, a fast pattern matching algorithm named MRSI is proposed in this paper.

Some systems are used for providing security to this data. Like these systems intrusion detection system (IDS) is used for providing security to computer networks and information systems. In IDS many systems uses number of techniques for providing accuracy by selecting complete features of dataset but they lagged in terms of time and memory. For real time applications time and memory is critical issue. So, there is a need of such systems which will minimize time and memory parameters. This paper presents IDS using two Methods. These both methods based on neural network. First method uses less features of dataset using Principal component Analysis (PCA) technique and second method uses complete features of dataset. Experiments are performed on these two methods using KDD Cup 99 dataset. The results simulate the effect of less featured based incomplete learning technique and complete feature based learning technique. According to the obtained results when the system usage the less features of KDD Cup 99 dataset with incomplete instances of data then the classification accuracy of model becomes less efficient as compared to the entire dataset training but it is efficient for time and memory parameters. So, Method I is beneficial for real time applications. These both systems are developed using Java technology.","","978-1-4799-8080-2","","10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7322612","Backpropagation;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);KDD Cup 99 Dataset;Neural Network;Principal Component Analysis (PCA)","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Cryptography;Image edge detection;Indexes;Neural networks;Principal component analysis","","","","","","","","","2-4 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system, intended mainly for Internet censorship, is a national-scale filter based on intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies. Our results indicate that the Chinese censors discontinued this HTML response filtering for the majority of routes some time between August 2008 and January 2009 (other forms of censorship, including backbone-level GET request filtering, are still in place). In this paper, we give evidence to show that the distributed nature of this filtering system and the problems inherent to distributed filtering are likely among the reasons it was discontinued, in addition to potential traffic load problems. When the censor successfully detected a keyword in our measurements and attempted to reset the connection, their attempt to reset the connection was successful less than 51% of the time, due to late or out-of-sequence resets. In addition to shedding light on why HTML response filtering may have been discontinued by the censors, we document potential sources of uncertainty, which are due to routing and protocol dynamics, that could affect measurements of any form of censorship in any country. Between a single client IP address in China and several contiguous server IP addresses outside China, measurement results can be radically different. This is probably due to either traffic engineering or one node from a bank of IDS systems being chosen based on source IP address. Our data provides a unique opportunity to study a national-scale, distributed filtering system.","1063-6927","978-1-4244-7261-1","","10.1109/ICDCS.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541676","","Computer science;Distributed computing;HTML;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Postal services;Telecommunication traffic","","","","0","","35","","","21-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposal is specified as the IEEE 802.11s amendment. Although the IEEE802.11s amendment is still a draft, some implementations based on it may already be found. The first and most widespread of these implementations is the one developed by One Laptop per Child (OLPC) for its educational laptop - the XO. One notable feature of IEEE 802.11s is the fact that the mesh network is implemented at the link layer, relying on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses for its mechanisms. This feature enables the design and development of new CPU-free network devices that provide layer-2 multihop communication. This tutorial describes the main characteristics of the IEEE 802.11s proposal illustrating the advantages and disadvantages of the MAC layer approach in comparison to the traditional layer three paradigm to multihop wireless networks. To achieve this, this work provides a detailed analysis of 802.11s traffic captured in a real testbed, with special attention to the path discovery mechanism. The step by step explanation of the mesh mechanisms highlights how some of the design choices may impact on the scalability and reliability of such networks.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.040210.00037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473885","HWMP;IEEE 802.11s;MANETS;multihop wireless networks;wireless mesh networks","Mesh networks;Portable computers;Scalability;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Tutorials;Wireless LAN;Wireless mesh networks","Tutorials;telecommunication network reliability;wireless LAN;wireless mesh networks","IEEE 802.11s;MAC addresses;OLPC;layer-2 multihop communication;mesh mechanisms;multihop MAC;one laptop per child;path discovery mechanism;reliability;scalability;wireless local area networks standard;wireless mesh capabilities","","11","","50","","2010-05-27","First Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Data plane functional update enables feature extension, customization, optimization and patch on design flaws, which is crucial for application to cope with the changes in operational constraints. A case study on network protection using this platform is included to verify the developed platform and to demonstrate the benefits of remote functional updates.

It consists of layers of alternating self-organizing map and sampling operator. The self-organizing layer is made up of certain numbers of SOMs, with each map only looking at a local region block on its input. The winning neuron's index value from every SOM in self-organizing layer is then organized in the sampling layer to generate another 2D map, which could then be fed to a second self-organizing layer. In this way, local information is gathered together, forming more global information in higher layers. The construction method of the DSOM is unique and will be introduced in this paper. Experiments were carried out to discuss how the DSOM architecture parameters affect the performance. We evaluate our proposed DSOM on MNIST and CASIA-HWDB1.1 dataset.

Proceedings. 20th IEEE Symposium on","20020806","2001","","","99","108","Local and wide area network information assurance analysts need current and precise knowledge about their system activities in order to address the challenges of critical infrastructure protection. In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance. Our reasoning framework has been developed by leveraging the concepts of cost analysis and pricing under uncertainty found in economics and finance.
