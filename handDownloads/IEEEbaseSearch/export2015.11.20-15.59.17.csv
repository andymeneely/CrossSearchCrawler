It is well known that reputation is an important property to promote cooperation among parties in game theory. Therefore, we consider the effect of reputation when parties interact in social cloud to find a new way realizing mutual cooperation. More specifically, parities in the social cloud are rational who value their reputation. Cooperation can boost their reputation, so they have incentives to cooperate with others such that they may get a higher utility. The basic idea of this paper is to add reputation deriving from social cloudas part of the utility. That is, we describe the architecture and interaction between two rational parties in the social cloud, where two parties receive their opponent's trust or reputation from the social cloud. The computation of trust and reputation is finished in the social cloud. Finally, we prove that given proper parameters in rational secure two-party computation (rational STPC), it is possible to complete the computation in just one round in the second stage of the protocol.","","978-1-4799-1774-7","","10.1109/WAINA.2015.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096180","Game theory;Nash equilibrium;Rational computation;Reputation;Social cloud","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Game theory;Lead;Protocols;Security;Social network services","cloud computing;game theory;social networking (online);trusted computing","STPC;game theory;rational parties;secure two-party computation;social cloud;trust computation","","0","","","","","24-27 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the proposed system model, an optimal downlink power allocation scheme is proposed under the constraints that 1) each user should satisfy individual signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) requirement for successful heterogeneous communication; 2) the sum of transmit power allocated to each user is equal to the permissible total transmit power at the smart meter; 3) allocated transmit power to each user is feasible. By employing the theorem that the sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables follows Erlang distribution, the probability distribution function (PDF) of the smallest allocated transmit power is mathematically obtained from the properties of downlink indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channels. Numerical results show that the total downlink capacity is greatly enhanced by the proposed power allocation scheme.

The objective of this project is to detect and perform defense mechanism for packet replication attack. A Packet replication problem reduced by the NS2 simulator for MANET, each data packet is replicated in the IP layer at its source. The number of replication times is determined by the number of route entries for the destination, each data packet is uniquely identified with the tree-id provided by NS2 and the redundant packets are discarded in the IP layer at the receiver.

The maximum number of consecutive deletions represents the constraint. Besides eliminating the need for finer exhaustive search in the attack database records in which the detected subsequence is too distorted, the new search procedure also enables better control over the search process in the case of deliberate distortion of the attack strings.

The security system is composed of some static monitoring nodes, a Transmote, and a home server. Static nodes with pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor and digital camera are mounted on doorframes and windows to detect intruders and send intrusion alarm messages to the home server. Transmote with PIR sensor and camera can patrol in the house for security surveillance. Transmote also can provide network repairing service when some static router nodes fail. Transmote modules and static monitoring nodes are controlled by two different wireless sensor networks. The remote house owner can get the alarm messages through Internet. Transmote can transform into I-shaped or O-shaped configuration according to different locomotion requirements. A prototype system has been implemented and some performance tests have been done. Experimental results show that the I-shaped Transmote can pass through an 8.8 cm high and 10 cm wide channel. The velocity of the I-shaped Transmote is up to 3 m/min and the maximum velocity of O-shaped Transmote is 9.3 m/min.

The overall performance of the new hardware system has been further compared with the presence of conventional Bayesian classifier and Support Vector Machines classifier. The experimental results show the very promising performance by considering the coupled metric learning scheme in the FPGA implementation.

We present intelligent systems architecture and integration, including risk management and validation for reduction of false positives and infrastructure protection using a novel approach using adaptive responses from firewall packet filters in what we call, network quarantine channels (NQC). This includes risk assessments and design of integrated virtual private networks (VPNs) and strategic controls via packet filters, which collaborate with the NQC to reply to suspicious hosts, and them deny access to sensitive data servers in the infrastructure. The firewall packet filters provide effective intelligent responses by to granting access to the normal packets and denying malicious traffic access to the network, after the identity of the connections are verified through the statistical analysis in the NQC. These effective strategies reduce false positives and increases detection capability of the IDS. The intelligent systems at the system-of-systems level include systems modeling and simulation, systems engineering education, training, quality management for intrusion detection, computer security and disaster response. The validation includes statistical analysis and modeling of systems integration for handling large-scale and complex systems in emerging commercial networks. This includes large-scale systems integration various applications for technology transfer between academia and industry, and applicable to communications systems, medical systems, management and sustainability. The paper examines issues in robust design- , factors, safety, security and usability, and transitions from design to production, deployment and use, quality control and system management and management interactions, risk management and systems architecture.","","1-4244-1041-X","1-4244-1041-X","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2007.374667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258872","communications systems;large-scale systems integration applications;medical systems;risk management;systems architecture and integration;technology transfer academia and industry;validation systems","Filters;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Modeling;Quality management;Risk management;Statistical analysis;Systems engineering and theory;Virtual private networks","risk management;security of data;statistical analysis;systems analysis;systems engineering;virtual private networks","academia;adaptive response;communications system;computer security;design to production;disaster response;firewall packet filter;integrated virtual private networks;intelligent engineering systems design;intelligent network infrastructure systems;intrusion detection system;large-scale system;medical system;network quarantine channel;network systems;packet filters;quality control;quality management;risk assessment;risk management;risk validation;statistical analysis;strategic control;system management;system-of-systems;systems architecture;systems engineering education;systems engineering training;systems modeling;systems simulation;technology transfer","","1","","20","","","9-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dynamic forensics using IDS or honeypot are all based on a common hypothesis that the system is still in a reliable working situation and collected evidences are believable even if the system is suffered from intrusion. In fact, the system has already transferred into an insecurity and unreliable state, it is uncertain that whether the intrusion detectors and investigators could run as normal and whether the obtained evidences are credible. Although intrusion tolerance has been applied in many areas of security for years, few researches are referred to network forensics. The work presented in this paper is based on an idea to integrate intrusion tolerance into dynamic forensics to make the system under control, ensure the reliability of evidences and aim to gather more useful evidences for investigation. A mechanism of dynamic forensics based on intrusion forensics is proposed. This paper introduces the architecture of the model which uses IDS as tolerance and forensics trigger and honeypot as shadow server, the finite state machine model is described to specify the mechanism, and then two cases are analyzed to illuminate the mechanism.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207895","dynamic forensics;finite state machine;intrusion tolerance","Automata;Control systems;Distributed processing;Forensics;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Protection;Real time systems","finite state machines;security of data","dynamic forensics;evidence reliability;finite state machine model;honeypot;integrate intrusion tolerance;intrusion detection system;network forensics;security","","0","","15","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When compared to wired and base station-based wireless networks: MANETs are susceptible to both insider and outsider attacks. This is mainly because of the lack of well-defined defense perimeter. In this paper, we define distributed firewall architecture that is designed specifically for MANET networks. Our design is using the concept of network capabilities and is especially suited for environment which lacks centralized structure and is composed of different devices. Our model denies all communication by default and nodes can access only services and other nodes that they are authorized to. Every node contains a firewall mechanism which includes intrusion prevention system and compromised node will not necessarily compromise whole secured network. Our approach should add security features for MANETs and help them withstand security threats which would otherwise damage, if not shutdown unsecured MANET network. Our simulation shows, that our solution has minimal overhead in terms of bandwidth and latency, works well even in the presence of routing changes due to mobile nodes and is effective in containing misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/SAMI.2015.7061882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7061882","Ad hoc;firewall;mobile network;network capability","Databases;Firewalls (computing);Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Public key","computer network reliability;firewalls;military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","base station-based wireless network routing;civil rapid-deployment network security;distributed firewall architecture;emergency rescue operations;intrusion prevention system security threats;mobile ad hoc disaster-relief network;mobile node fault;tactical military MANET;well-defined defense perimeter","","0","","9","","","22-24 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increases in electricity demand with inadequate delivery infrastructure and cyber-physical attack threats due to technological interdependencies introduce more complex events. Accurate and timely power system event identification and detection have great significance in system operation, monitoring, and control processes. Insufficient and slow event information may lead to catastrophes. Significant research effort is being made toward developing robust monitoring systems using advanced state of the art technologies such as synchrophasor technologies. This paper extends our previous work [1] and proposes a model that leverages the causal relationship between devices in cyber physical systems. Causal event graphs (CEG), a modified version of Bayesian networks, are used to create unique paths that model deterministic signatures of each cyber-physical event. The CEG and Bayesian network can be incorporated to event detection systems (EDS) to classify cyber physical events. A causal event graph for each scenario can be created using a sequence of power system events, measureable states, and logs from different sources. A modified IEEE 9 bus system with multi zone distance protection schemes for two transmission lines is used to demonstrate the proposed concept. A total of 22 cyber-physical scenarios are mapped into CEG and Bayesian networks to define rules for cyber-power system events.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939285","Bayesian network;CEG;EDS;cyber-physical;scenarios;synchrophasor","Bayes methods;Circuit faults;Monitoring;Phasor measurement units;Power system stability;Relays","belief networks;graph theory;phasor measurement;power transmission lines;power transmission protection","Bayesian networks;IEEE 9 bus system;causal event graph;cyber-physical attack threats;cyber-power system events;event detection systems;multizone distance protection;power system event identification;robust monitoring systems;synchrophasor technology;transmission lines","","0","","18","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With any Cyber-Physical system use Cloud Web Services it inherits a security problem, the HX-DoS attack. HX-DoS attack is a combination of HTTP and XML messages that are intentionally sent to flood and destroy the communication channel of the cloud service provider. The relevance of this research is that TCP/IP flood attacks are a common problem and a lot of research to mitigate them has previously been discussed. But HTTP denial of service and XML denial of service problem has only been addressed in a few papers.

Many proposed schemes were presented recently, but none of which, employing separate system bus, have been proven experimentally as a potentially effective method for protecting the data stored in hard drives and removable disks. In our scheme, the system does not need to maintain any authentication mechanism or data integrity for the packets sent by any node, with a well-received attention towards threatening our valuable stored data. In this paper we implemented a model for a dual bus architecture system based on a bus bridge which controls the data transferred between the two system buses, as well as preventing all spy ware programs.

"A proactive risk-aware robotic sensor network for Critical Infrastructure Protection","McCausland, J.; Di Nardo, G.; Falcon, R.; Abielmona, R.; Groza, V.; Petriu, E.","Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Univ. of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Computational Intelligence and Virtual Environments for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIVEMSA), 2013 IEEE International Conference on","20131003","2013","","","132","137","In this paper, a risk-aware robotic sensor network (RSN) is proposed in the context of Critical Infrastructure Protection. Such a network will be comprised of mobile sensor nodes that perceive various aspects of their environment and topologically reconfigure in order to secure a strategic area of interest. Risk awareness is provided through the application of a recently developed Risk Management Framework to the RSN. The risk level of each node is assessed in terms of their degree of distress, proximity factor, and terrain maneuverability. Risk monitoring alerts are issued whenever any given sensor node's quantitative risk metric exceeds a user-defined threshold value. At this point, a node-in-distress (NID) has been identified as the weak point of the securing structure around which the RSN is deployed. The NID can no longer be used with confidence and the effective perimeter coverage of the RSN has been reduced, thus creating potential security breaches in the area of interest. In response, the remaining nodes will self-organize to maximize the perimeter coverage while minimizing the cost of doing so. A limited set of contingency network topologies is produced via evolutionary multi-objective optimization using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and then ranked according to a human-guided alternative selection algorithm.

Electric power dispatch systems, management information systems, customer relation systems and so on, are all built on this infrastructure. It is an important task for network administrators of electric power industry to monitor, control and manage electric power information networks. Through installing safeguards, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and anti-virus systems, the reliability of Electric Power Information Networks has been improved to a certain extent. However, threats also exist due to the loss of comprehensive understanding about network vulnerability. System methods should be employed to the vulnerability research of electric power information networks. Modeling Electric Power Information Network vulnerability and finding network flaws become more and more critical. A network intruder will take a series of actions to achieve a certain goal, and each action will change the state of a network. Thereby attack trees can be used to model the vulnerability of a network. An attack tree can be viewed as a directed tree where vertices represent network states and edges represent actions that lead state transitions. Root vertex is a certain goal. Any path from a leaf vertex to the root vertex is a whole attack pattern violating the security property of a network. A node of an attack tree can be decomposed as a set of attack sub-goals, either all of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed, or any one of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed. So there are two decomposition operations in an attack tree: AND and OR. Formal logic can be applied to attack analysis. Thus we can model attacks for network vulnerability analysis. This modeling method has two major advantages. At first it can be used to analyze the flaws of a network - - and find unknown flaws. Secondly network administrators use it to handle flaws rationally under the limits of the finite resources. Electric power information networks are generally made up of production control networks, enterprise management networks and external networks. They are connected and form a complex network. It is necessary to comprehend and analyze its vulnerability. An information network of an electric power plant is illustrated, and attack modeling is used to analyze its vulnerability. Industry control computers can manipulate electric devices. It is vital to guarantee industry control computers. Hence the goal is set to obtain the administrator right of an industry control computer. An attack tree is constructed tolocate the flaws of the network. Some advices to network security administrators are given. It is an attempt to formulate the security administration of electric power information networks using attack trees. Faulty Tree Method (FTM) has been used to analysis the reliability of power systems. Attack tree can help integrate the reliability analysis of the hybrid system consisting of an electric power system and an electric power information network system.","","978-1-4244-5938-4","","10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5666152","Electric power information network;attack tree;network security;vulnerability","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Fires;Monitoring;Security;Servers","directed graphs;fault trees;formal logic;load dispatching;power system reliability;power system simulation;security of data;trees (mathematics)","FTM;attack modeling;customer relation system;directed tree;electric power dispatch system;electric power information networks;electric power system;enterprise management networks;faulty tree method;formal logic;industry control computer;management information system;network security administrators;network vulnerability analysis;power system analysis;power system reliability;production control networks;root vertex;safeguard","","0","","15","","","24-28 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, a novel method to determine membership function is proposed, and a new FSVM based on non-equilibrium data is constructed.

A pattern consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps of fixed lengths. PERG preprocesses a database of these patterns into hardware. To our knowledge, PERG is the first pattern matching hardware targeting viruses, as well as the first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. This makes guarding against false positives faster than traditional Bloom filters because verification requires checking against one pattern instead of several patterns. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into one modest FPGA chip with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. The architecture achieves roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern-matching engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters.

Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used. We develop mathematical models based on stochastic petri nets to identify the optimal rate for IDS execution to maximize the mean time to security failure of the system, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational conditions and attacker behaviors.","","978-0-7695-3448-0","978-0-7695-3448-0","10.1109/PRDC.2008.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725308","host-based IDS;intrusion detection;mean time to security failure;mission-oriented group communication systems;mobile ad hoc networks;voting-based IDS","Bandwidth;Batteries;Communication system security;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Petri nets;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","attacker behavior;intrusion detection system technique;mathematical model;mission-oriented mobile group system;mobile ad hoc network;operational condition;stochastic petri net;system failure definition;system lifetime maximization","","0","","28","","","15-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, we consider the case that the data communications system to support RTP (i.e., to broadcast power price information to the deferrable load) can be under attack, which makes the power price information unavailable or falsified.

We propose a new methodology for verifying the vulnerability of firewall configurations to IP spoofing attack and for synthesizing IP spoofing-free configurations.

In order to ensure high security this work focuses on multiple classifier fusion technique to increase detection rate. The primary role of classifier is to classify the correct and incorrect instance therefore multiple classifier design that is practical, and detects more attack by means of combining them is preferred here. To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done. Decision based on threshold value and combining the classifiers result based on majority voting rule helps to increase the overall efficiency and accuracy in detecting the various categories of attack.","","978-1-4799-3826-1","","10.1109/ICCPEIC.2014.6915405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915405","Fusion;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Majority Voting Rule;Multiple Classifier","","security of data;sensor fusion","detection methodologies;diversified intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;misuse based attacks;multiple classifier fusion technique;security;sensor fusion;threshold value","","0","","17","","","16-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20090626","2009","","","1124","1129","Testing network-based security tools such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) differs from testing ordinary network tools (e.g., routers and switches). Basically, in addition to the parameters (such as bandwidth utilization, routing information and packets timing) that are important for network tools, security tools are more sensitive to issues like traffic composition, contents, and session level parameters. Generating a realistic synthetic traffic that keeps all the characteristics of the real traffic has proved to be difficult. For this reason, security testers often use real traffic traces in their test or evaluation. However, the available traces are often limited in number or size. Therefore, it is necessary to merge and manipulate traces to create a test environment that would be representative of the operational environment, and to inject attacks into the traffic. A variety of tools for recording, replaying as well as forging packets can be obtained easily, but there exist very few tools for manipulating traces so as to modify the traffic composition from the networking viewpoint. Among them, surprisingly there is no tool for manipulating traces without destructing their security-relevant characteristics. In this paper, we present a brief survey for trace manipulation and packet forging tools. Then we determine the requirements of tools for manipulating traces and injecting attacks while keeping their original characteristics. Finally, we present the architecture, and the implementation of our tool intended to fill this lack in security testing tools.","","978-1-4244-3999-7","978-0-7695-3639-2","10.1109/WAINA.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136802","","Character generation;Communication system traffic control;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Switches;System testing;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Traffic control","IP networks;bandwidth allocation;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","TCP/IP network;attack injection;bandwidth utilization;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;network traffic trace manipulation tool;network-based security testing tool;packet forging tool;packet timing;routing information","","1","","15","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we select effective security parameters for our detection engine using an equivalent class with a graphical illustration namely correlation relation graph (CRG). These extracted parameters among all parameters of each normal behavior have a relation with each other which could be computed by regression relations. Each behavior has some pairs of selected parameters including the independent parameter and the dependent one. As an inline detection process, we look at the value of selected parameters of each current session and put them into their computed regression relation. If the computed value of the dependent parameter of each pair has a value greater then what we compute by their regression relation, it will be considered as a deviation. Number of deviations per session and the combination of them is used to label a session as normal or attack.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA “10. KIDS” core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6598669","Adversarial classification;anomaly detection;intrusion detection systems;secure machine learning","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","KIDS;anomaly detection systems;evasion attacks;key-recovery attacks;keyed anomaly detection system;machine learning algorithms","","0","","23","","2013-09-13","May-June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Network traffic monitoring is can be quite a network diagnostic tool that monitors local area networks and provides a graphical display of network statistics. While collecting information through the network's data stream, network monitor displays the source address of the computer that sent a frame onto the network, the destination address of the computer that received the frame and also the protocols employed to send the frame. The procedure through which network monitor collects this information is known as Capturing. Automatically, the network monitor gathers statistics on all of the frames it detects on the network into a capture buffer that is a reserved storage area in memory. To capture statistics on merely a specific subset of frames, we could discriminate these frames by designing a capture filter. To work with network monitor, the computer will need to have a network card that supports promiscuous mode.

To be able to detect misuse of cloud instances, this work presents an anomaly detection system for Infrastructure as a Service Clouds. It is based on Cloud customers' usage behaviour analysis. Neural networks are used to analyse and learn the normal usage behaviour of Cloud customers, to then detect anomalies which could originate from a cloud security incident caused by an overtaken virtual machine. It increases transparency for Cloud customers about the security of their Cloud instances and supports the Cloud provider to detect misuse of their infrastructure.

It is a scalable algorithm able to deal with IP traffic at a very high bit rate thanks to the use of hashing functions over a sliding window. Moreover it does not need any a priori knowledge about traffic characteristics.

If enough peers participate, the overall system can survive isolated failures. Applying this approach to distributed file integrity checking (or similar security-sensitive areas) requires that current and untampered information is distributed among the peers in such a way that a limited number of malicious peers cannot subvert or sabotage the overall system. This paper presents a mechanism to provide such tamper-resistant replicated storage in a decentralised peer-to-peer system where no component is trusted a priori. We present a system model for our mechanism, and discuss the threats and countermeasures used to detect tampering.

"Protecting peer-to-peer network with roaming agents","Banik, S.M.; Urey, H.","Dept. of Math. & Comput. Sci., Citadel, Charleston, SC, USA","SoutheastCon 2015","20150625","2015","","","1","6","Peer-to-peer networks are continuously becoming more popular for sharing data and resources. However, a major drawback of this type of network is its ability to maintain security, since there is no centralized server to oversee the network. One way to remedy this problem is through the use of intelligent mobile agents. These agents will act as guards, which will essentially roam the network and periodically check on each node to ensure that it is not under attack. In our previous research, we have proposed algorithms for initial placement of agents in a given peer-to-peer network. As the agents are mobile, the next issue with agent-based security is how the agents should roam around the network to detect attacks. We want the agents to scan the entire network as quickly as possible which will minimize the detection time of attacks. If we run too many agents simultaneously to scan the network, they will consume system resources which will slow down the performance of applications running on the peer-to-peer network. In this paper we have proposed three roaming algorithms for agents. The first algorithm Heavy Scan Algorithm scans the network with minimum time by sacrificing the performance of the application. The second algorithm Light Scan Algorithm takes the maximum time to complete the scan of the entire network with less degradation of the performance of the application. The third algorithm Medium Scan Algorithm balances time to complete the scan with performance of the application. We have illustrated the proposed algorithms with an example. We have also analyzed the complexity of the proposed algorithms.","","","","10.1109/SECON.2015.7132990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7132990","agents;intrusion detection;peer-to-peer networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Delays;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Peer-to-peer computing","computational complexity;computer network security;mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing","agent-based security;attack detection time;centralized server;data sharing;heavy scan algorithm;intelligent mobile agents;light scan algorithm;medium scan algorithm;peer-to-peer network;resource sharing;roaming agents;roaming algorithms","","1","","9","","","9-12 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Impact of Sanitized Message Flows in a Cooperative Intrusion Warning System","Tolle, J.; Jahnke, M.; Felde, N.G.; Martini, P.","Res. Establ. for Appl. Sci., Wachtberg","Military Communications Conference, 2006. MILCOM 2006. IEEE","20070212","2006","","","1","7","This paper discusses the side effects of sanitizing IT security event messages in a cooperative multi-domain intrusion warning system (IWS). To enhance detection capabilities of conventional IT security tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS), virus scanners and packet filters, a centralized, so-called intrusion warning system can be deployed, which collects and analyzes event messages from the different domains. Additionally, the IWS informs the domains about potentially critical situations which might not be covered by the existing tools due to technical limitations, heterogeneous security policies or differences in configuration. The architecture of an IWS relies on centralized storage and analysis components, while the event messages are collected and preprocessed by distributed entities which are under the operational control of the respective domains. In cooperation scenarios like military coalition environments (CEs, e.g. NATO, KFOR, SFOR), potentially confidential or sensitive information still needs to be concealed from the CE partners, as defined by existing information sharing policies. This also holds for the information contained in IDS event messages, since there might be specifications of network addresses and topologies, of products or vendors, of applications and security systems included in the messages. Thus, for enabling a CE wide cooperation of IT security systems, appropriate information sanitizing techniques need to be applied before sharing any security relevant information. This might lead to a negative impact on the centralized analysis capabilities, since potentially important information might be dropped from the messages. In this paper, the impact of sanitizing event message flows in a cooperative IWS is studied by examining the behaviour of an IWS when feeding it with real-life event messages combined with artificial events from an Internet worm spreading simulation. The worm detection capabilities of the analysis components are de- - termined in a multi-domain setup for both situations, with and without applying information sanitizing mechanisms on the event message flow","","1-4244-0617-X","1-4244-0618-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086733","","Alarm systems;Centralized control;Discrete event simulation;Event detection;Filters;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology","Internet;invasive software;message passing;telecommunication security","IDS event messages;IT security event message flow sanitization;Internet worm spreading simulation;artificial events;cooperative IWS;cooperative multidomain intrusion warning system;real-life event messages;worm detection capabilities","","1","1","17","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel approach to analyse and model network traffic anomalies is presented. The proposed approach individually characterises different aspects of anomalies, such as origin, termination, propagation and changes in duration and volume, with common random processes. These characteristics are then integrated into a single model that successfully captures the overall anomaly behaviours. Characterisation of each anomaly property requires only a few parameters, leading to a concise set of parameters for the entire model. Although the model is calibrated with local measurements made at nodes, it successfully represents the global behaviours of anomalies over the network. The proposed model is applicable both at nodal level and at subnet level. This enables hierarchically analysing large and sophisticated networks. Anomalies are analysed using a multi-scale analysis framework based on which, a real-time monitoring system that efficiently communicate ongoing anomaly information across the network is developed. The system is also used for learning regional model parameters distributively. Internet2 traffic data is analysed using the framework, and the corresponding model parameters are derived. These results provide insight on the nature of anomalies in networks.","2047-4954","","","10.1049/iet-net.2013.0123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786899","","","Internet;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic anomalies;Internet2 trafflc data;anomaly property;common random processes;global behaviours;multiscale analysis framework;network performance studies;network provisioning;network trafflc anomalies;real-time monitoring system;regional model parameters;robust network design;sophisticated networks;spatiotemporal model","","0","","","","","March 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Since the nodes communicate with each other, they cooperate by forwarding data packets to other nodes in the network. Thus the nodes find a path to the destination node using routing protocols. However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Sinking Behaviour and Collision Behaviour Attack against network integrity absorbing all data packets in the network. Since the data packets do not reach the destination node on account of this attack, data loss will occur. Simulated the sinking behaviour and collision behaviour attack in various wireless ad-hoc network scenarios and have tried to find a response system in simulations. The intrusion detection identifies the detection accuracy by using cross-layer features to define a routing behaviour.","","978-1-4673-2756-5","","10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450551","Collision Behaviour Attack;Cross Layer;Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks;Sinking Behaviour Attack","Cross layer design;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security","MANET;collision behaviour attack;cross layer performance;data loss;data packet forwarding;destination node;detection accuracy;intrusion detection;malicious node;network attack;network infrastructure;network integrity;routing behaviour;routing protocol;security vulnerability;sinking behaviour attack;wireless ad-hoc network;wireless mobile node","","0","","10","","","21-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, LS-SVM adopts equality constraints and squared functions, which leads to solve an easy-to-compute linear system, however followed is the lack of sparseness, all training data will become the support vector of LS-SVM, which cause the low intrusion detection speed. This paper proposed a novel LS-SVM intrusion detection model using kernel space approximation through greedy searching, thus constructed a subspace basis of original space populated by training data. Through this approximation, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate LS-SVM model were reduced, which greatly helped to improve the response time of intrusion detection. The kernel-target alignment method was utilized to obtain optimal Gaussian kernel parameter and 10-fold cross-validate method to obtain optimal trade-off parameter. The MIT's KDD Cup 99 dataset was used to evaluate our present model, and the results clearly demonstrate that the method can be an effective way for fast intrusion detection","","1-4244-0332-4","","10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1713169","intrusion detection;kernel space approximation;kernel target Alignment;least squares support vector machines","Computer security;Educational technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Least squares approximation;Linear systems;Quadratic programming;Space technology;Support vector machines;Training data","Gaussian processes;greedy algorithms;least squares approximations;search problems;security of data;support vector machines","10-fold cross-validate method;Gaussian kernel parameter;KDD Cup 99 dataset;greedy searching;inear system;intrusion detection;kernel space approximation;kernel-target alignment;least squares support vector machines","","1","","13","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore in this paper, we proposes a novel kind of incremental kernel principal component analysis algorithm: Data characteristic extraction based on IPCA algorithm-DCEIPCA, which allows efficient processing of large datasets and overcome the insufficient of KPCA.

"A cooperative rintrusion detection algorithm based on trusted voting for mobile ad hoc network","Malek, S.F.; Khorsandi, S.","","Electrical Engineering (ICEE), 2013 21st Iranian Conference on","20130916","2013","","","1","8","In this paper we will propose a cooperative intrusion detection algorithm based on trusted voting on the basis of the security requirements of intrusion detection systems in mobile ad hoc networks. To run our algorithm, the network is divided into clusters and three types of nodes called header, monitor and general node are defined in each cluster. Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol. Using trust-worthy nodes in voting process, defining three confidence levels for the general nodes, also taking into account the traffic rate, remaining energy and speed of general nodes in the decision making phase, considerably reduces the negative impact of natural limitation of these networks on accuracy detection, increasing the number of malicious nodes will not have any effect in accuracy of this algorithm and it is possible to detect all malicious nodes simultaneously.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599816","Attack;False Detection;MANET;Voting;intrusion Detection System","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection algorithm;general node;header;mobile ad hoc network;monitor;trust-worthy nodes;trusted voting","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we focus on a virtual intrusion detection system (V-IDS). We present a new architecture that uses the basic principles of cloud computing, virtualization, and the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane and applies them to intrusion detection systems, in order to protect cloud networks characterized by a constantly changing underlying infrastructure and physical topology. Our research is not focused on new algorithms or products capable of solving the security problem in cloud networks: our goal is to define a process and a novel architecture that minimizes the security risk in distributed networks, implementing the principle that network security and reliability is not a “product,” but a well defined “process.” On the basis of the defined architecture we have implemented a prototype cloud-based IDS that validates our thesis. The prototype is realized though the integration of two open source technologies: OpenNebula and Dynamic Resource Allocation via GMPLS Optical Networks (DRAGON). © 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.21562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6770191","","","","","","0","","","","","Dec. 2012","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

Traditional MITM attacks by ARP Poisoning expose the attacker's identity and thereby physical location. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge it is for the first time that an MITM attack has been added with stealth capabilities. We propose two new attacks namely Stealth MITM(SMITM) and Semi-Stealth MITM(SSMITM) at the Data Link Layer using ARP Spoofing which add stealth capabilities to MITM attacks, thereby concealing the identity of an attacker. Finally, we give a detection and defense technique for the attacks. All the attacks proposed in the paper have been verified and successfully validated in a 300+ node real production network and test beds which include nodes with latest Linux and Windows operating systems under default and secured network scenarios. The results have been 100% effective and have proved the reproducibility of the proposed attacks.","","978-1-4673-2922-4","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449847","ARP Poisoning;IPv4 Network Security;Man In The Middle Attacks (MITM);Networks and Information Security;Stealth Man In The Middle Attacks (SMITM)","Local area networks;Switches","IP networks;computer network security;protocols","ARP poisoning;ARP spoofing;IPv4 network;Linux operating system;Windows operating system;address resolution protocol poisoning;address resolution protocol spoofing;computer network;data link layer;defense technique;detection technique;on-the-fly manipulation;packet interception;real production network;semistealth man-in-the-middle attack;stealth capability","","0","","13","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Misuse detection is the most popular approach to detect intrusions, using a library of signatures to find attacks. The accuracy of the signatures is paramount for an effective IDS, still today's practitioners rely on manual techniques to improve and update those signatures. We present a system, called pSigene, for the automatic generation of intrusion signatures by mining the vast amount of public data available on attacks. It follows a four-step process to generate the signatures, by first crawling attack samples from multiple public cyber security web portals. Then, a feature set is created from existing detection signatures to model the samples, which are then grouped using a biclustering algorithm which also gives the distinctive features of each cluster. Finally the system automatically creates a set of signatures using regular expressions, one for each cluster. We tested our architecture for SQL injection attacks and found our signatures to have a True and False Positive Rates of 90.52% and 0.03%, respectively and compared our findings to other SQL injection signature sets from popular IDS and web application firewalls. Results show our system to be very competitive to existing signature sets.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903566","SQL injection;biclustering;signature generalization;web application security","Clustering algorithms;Computer security;Databases;Feature extraction;Manuals;Portals","SQL;authorisation;data mining;digital signatures;portals","IDS;SQL injection attack;SQL injection signature;Webcrawling;biclustering algorithm;crawling attack;data mining;intrusion detection system;misuse detection;pSigene;public cyber security Web portal","","0","","44","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting. We evaluate the technique on the KDD data set as well as on data from a real (telecom) IP test network. The experiments show good detection quality and illustrate the usefulness of adapting to normality.","","0-7695-2328-5","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2005.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437175","","Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Data mining;Electronic mail;Face detection;Indexing;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Testing","IP networks;data mining;data structures;pattern clustering;real-time systems;telecommunication security","ADW ICE;IP network;KDD data set;anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering;data mining techniques;data structures;grid-based index;real-time anomaly detection","","1","","15","","","6-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we used a new labelled network dataset, called Kyoto 2006+ dataset. In Kyoto 2006+ data set, every instant is labelled as normal (no attack), attack (known attack) and unknown attack. We use Decision Tree (J48) algorithm to classify the network packet that can be used for NIDS. For training and testing we used 134665 network instances.
