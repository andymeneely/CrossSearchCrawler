Proceedings","20030422","2003","1","","164","175 vol.1","Packets sent using the IP protocol include the IP address of the sending host. The recipient directs replies to the sender using this source address. However, the correctness of this address is not verified by the protocol. The IP protocol specifies no method for validating the authenticity of the packet's source. This implies that an attacker can forge the source address to be any desired. This is almost exclusively done for malicious or at least inappropriate purposes. Given that attackers can exploit this weakness for many attacks, it would be beneficial to know if network traffic has spoofed source addresses. This knowledge can be particularly useful as an adjunct to reduce false positive from intrusion detection systems. This paper discusses attacks using spoofed packets and a wide variety of methods for detecting spoofed packets. These include both active and passive host-based methods as well as the more commonly discussed routing-based methods. Additionally, we present the results of experiments to verify the effectiveness of passive methods.","","0-7695-1897-4","","10.1109/DISCEX.2003.1194882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194882","","Computer science;Ethernet networks;Intrusion detection;Probes;Protocols;Routing;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP address;IP protocol;active host-based methods;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;passive host-based methods;routing-based methods;spoofed packet detection;spoofed source addresses","","9","9","33","","","22-24 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much work has been done in this field; however, most of the prior work results in low memory efficiency (defined as the ratio of the amount of the required storage in bytes and the size of the dictionary in number of characters). Due to such inefficiency, state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose an algorithm called ""leaf-attaching"" to preprocess a given dictionary without increasing the number of patterns. The resulting set of postprocessed patterns can be searched using any tree-search data structure. We also present a scalable, high-throughput, Memory-efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM) based on a pipelined binary search tree. The proposed algorithm and architecture achieve a memory efficiency of 0.56 (for the Rogets dictionary) and 1.32 (for the Snort dictionary). As a result, our design scales well to support larger dictionaries. Implementations on 45 nm ASIC and a state-of-the-art FPGA device (for latest Rogets and Snort dictionaries) show that our architecture achieves 24 and 3.2 Gbps, respectively. The MASM module can simply be duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves simply rewriting the content of the memory, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148214","ASIC;Aho-Corasick;DFA;Databases;Dictionaries;Memory management;Pattern matching;Rogets;Snort;String matching;Throughput;Vectors;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);leaf attaching;pipeline;reconfigurable","Databases;Dictionaries;Memory management;Pattern matching;Throughput;Vectors","Internet;application specific integrated circuits;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;storage management;string matching;tree searching","ASIC;FPGA device;MASM module;NIDS;Rogets dictionary;Snort dictionary;characters per cycle;content matching;dictionary dictionary;dictionary preprocessing;dictionary update;high-latency external DRAM;large-scale string pattern matching;leaf-attaching;malicious pattern dictionary;memory content rewriting;modular approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;pipelined binary search tree;predefined database;scalable high-throughput memory-efficient architecture;tree-search data structure","","1","","19","","2012-02-07","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The combination of feature selection using the newly proposed genetic feature selection algorithm with Support Vector Machine based classification gives better results than other exiting methods. This is due to the fact that the proposed feature selection algorithm enhances the performance of the classifier in detecting the attacks by providing the most useful attributes.

These tiny nodes are supported by very limited computational and energy resources. In flat topology, the nodes relay every data item collected by each node towards the gateway node, thereby draining the energy of the relaying nodes soon. In a WSN application, it may not be possible to replace the batteries always. One of the basic requirements of any WSN application is energy conservation of the nodes. Using hierarchical topology, the data is collected from the nodes in the near vicinity and the same is aggregated and these aggregate values are sent to the gateway node.

In this work, we attempt to quantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key characteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the number of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree. Specifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential growth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. Through both mathematical analysis and simulation, we find that the number of children has asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on average half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98% of infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of infected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the generation follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length of the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with the total number of infected hosts. Next, we study the infection structure of localized-scanning and permutation-scanning worms through simulation and surprisingly find that the above observations also apply to these worms. Finally, we apply our findings to evaluate bot assessment strategies for forensic analysis after a worm tree has been formed.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2012.2204981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218774","Botnet;detection;probabilistic modeling;simulation;topology;worm infection family tree","Analytical models;Grippers;Internet;Joints;Mathematical model;Measurement;Peer to peer computing","Internet;Poisson distribution;computer network security;geometry;invasive software;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics)","Internet worm infection family tree characteristics;Poisson distribution;approximate-logarithmic average path length;asymptotic geometric distribution;bot assessment strategies;botnets;children;forensic analysis;host infection ability quantification;localized-scanning worms;mathematical analysis;permutation-scanning worms;probabilistic modeling methods;security threats;sequential growth model;simulations;vulnerable host;worm infection topology","","1","","40","","2012-06-15","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks are the major concern for security in the collaborative networks. Although non DDOS attacks are also make the network performances poor, the effect of DDOS attacks is severe. In DDOS attacks, flooding of the particular node as victim and jam it with massive traffic happens and the complete network performance is affected. In this paper, a novel Intrusion Detection and Prevention System is designed which detects the flooding DDOS attacks based on Firecol and prevents the attacks based on Dynamic Growing Self Organizing Tree (DGSOT) for collaborative networks. Simulation results show that DGSOT with Firecol (DGSOTFC) produces better intrusion detection and prevention system.

By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","36","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Typically, centralized approaches to IP traffic analysis have scalability problems, which are addressed by replacing existing hardware with more powerful CPUs and faster memory. In contrast, this paper developed and implemented SCRIPT (Scalable Real-time IP Flow Record Analysis), which defines a scalable analysis framework that can be used to distribute flow records to multiple nodes performing traffic analysis in order to balance the overall workload among those nodes. Due to its generic design, the framework developed can be extended and used to distribute other metering data, such as packet headers, payloads, or accounting records.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-5366-5","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488476","Distributed Analysis;IP Flow Accounting;Peer-to-Peer","Data analysis;Hardware;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Performance analysis;Protocols;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;computer network management;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic recording","Internet protocol;SCRIPT;intrusion detection;network management;network monitoring;network planning;packet headers;scalable real-time IP flow record analysis;traffic analysis","","3","","27","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A WSN is a versatile smart sensing system to support pervasive monitoring in a variety of applications. In this context available middleware platforms usually provide the Application Layer with different basic services, as shared memory or addressing repository, but do not usually provide security services such as secure links management protocol or intrusion detection. Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN. The security-related components of the proposed middleware include a light yet powerful cryptographic scheme (TAKS) and an Intrusion Detection System (WIDS): the former module exploits the topological properties of a WSN, while the latter one is based on a Weak Process Model approach.","","","","10.1109/Mobilware.2013.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775056","cryptographic scheme;intrusion detection system;middleware;security;wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Intrusion detection;Middleware;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cryptographic protocols;middleware;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks;application layer;cryptographic scheme;distributed resource constrained systems;intrusion detection;middleware platforms;pervasive monitoring;resource constraints;secure communications;secure links management protocol;smart sensing system;weak process model approach","","0","","40","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first generation of AISs which is inspired only by the adaptive immune system has some weak points and suffers from excessive amount of false alarms. The next generation of AISs is inspired by “Danger Theory” and tries to mimic the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune system of the body. Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach comprises of three steps. First, the functional requirement specified as a set of use cases are mapped to success tree and fault tree. Second, fault tree and success tree are synthesized to obtain minimum cut sets. These cut sets are then used to identify missing or incorrectly documented requirements. Third, we propose a formalized method to find vulnerable failure modes of software systems with the combination of SFMEA and SFTA techniques. Further, we suggest compensating provisions to avoid the occurrence of these critical failures.

The algorithm produces an ad hoc transformation for each image, adapting the mapping functions to each image's characteristics to produce the maximum enhancement. We analyze the contrast of the image in the boundary and textured regions, and group the information with common characteristics. These groups model the relations within the image, from which we extract the transformation functions. The results are then adaptively mixed, by considering the human vision system characteristics, to boost the details in the image. Results show that the algorithm can automatically process a wide range of images—e.g., mixed shadow and bright areas, outdoor and indoor lighting, and face images—without introducing artifacts, which is an improvement over many existing methods.","1057-7149","","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2198667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198348","Channel division;contrast enhancement;contrast pair;dark image enhancement","Dynamic range;Face;Force;Helium;Histograms;Image edge detection;Image enhancement","","","","6","","27","","2012-05-10","Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Digital forensics is a branch of computer security that makes use of electronic evidence to build up a criminal case or for troubleshooting purposes. Advances have been made since the advent of Cloud computing in addressing issues that came with the Cloud including that of security. However, not all aspects of security are advancing. Developments in digital forensics still leave a lot to be desired in terms of standards and appropriate digital forensic tools that are applicable in the Cloud. To achieve that, standards as well as standard tools are required for successful evidence collection, preservation, analysis and conviction in case of a criminal case. This paper contributes towards addressing issues in digital forensics by presenting an algorithm that can be used in the evidence identification phase of a digital forensic process. Data in Cloud environments exist in the Internet or in networked environments and data is always accessed remotely. There is therefore at least one connection to a host that exists in a Cloud environment. In a case of a computer system that hosts a Cloud service, the number of connections from clients can be very large. In such a scenario it is very hard to identify an attacker from both active and recently disconnected connections to a host. This may require an investigator to probe all individual IP addresses connected to the host which can be time consuming and costly. There is therefore a need for a mechanism that can identify and rank remote hosts that are connected to a victim host and that may be associated with a malicious activity. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses probabilities to identify and rank suspicious remote hosts connected to a victim host. This algorithm helps minimize the effort required of investigators to probe each IP address that is connected to a victim as connected IP addresses will be prio- itized according to their rank.","","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641044","Cloud Computing;Digital Forensic Processes;Digital Forensics;Intrusion Detection","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Digital forensics;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model","cloud computing;digital forensics;probability","Internet;cloud computing;cloud environment;computer security;digital forensic investigation;digital forensic tools;electronic evidence;evidence identification phase;individual IP addresses;malicious activity;probability;remote host ranking;remote host selection;victim host","","0","","16","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First is that the worm's propagation behavior is expressed as tree-like structures. Second is that the worm's selection of infection targets does not consider which hosts its infected host communicates too frequently. Then, by constructing trees that are composed of anomaly connections, ACTM detects the existence of such worms.

This is due to the incompleteness of the signatures which lacks or has very little information about when, where and how to match these signatures. The signatures enriched with this information significantly brings down the false positives and at the same time enhances the performance of the signature detection module. In this paper we propose a state base signature detection model which leverages on our state aware signatures with sufficiently complete information to match these signatures. The proposed model keeps track of the state of the connection and matches the signatures within appropriate packets. We further classify our signatures that span across multiple packet and across multiple sessions. We also provide the notion of virtual signatures which represents patterns within packets in a distributed form. In this paper we demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed model to detect these virtual patterns, multi-packet and multi-session leveraging on our state aware signatures.","","978-1-4244-4790-9","978-1-4244-4791-6","10.1109/IADCC.2010.5423011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5423011","Multi-Packet;Multi-Session;State Based Model;State Based Signature;component","Change detection algorithms;Computer networks;Computer vision;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protocols;Search engines;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;pattern matching","IDS;IPS;multipacket signature detection;multisession signature detection;pattern matching;state aware signatures;state base model","","0","","23","","","19-20 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this, 99.999~ availability is achieved by combining the optical laser beam with an alternate path RF solution. The laser beam of 1550~nm provides high-bandwidth connectivity in majority of the time, whereas the RF path maintains critical network connectivity during extreme weather events that are detrimental to the FSO link, such as thick fog. Optical wireless links suffer from atmospheric loss mainly because of fog, scintillation and precipitation. The authors investigate here the impact of fog, rain and snow effects and evaluate their performances for the optical propagation through the atmosphere. The wireless back-up link is used only in very dense fog conditions.

In this paper, we present our technique, Sania, for detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities in Web applications during the development and debugging phases. Sania intercepts the SQL queries between a Web application and a database, and automatically generates elaborate attacks according to the syntax and semantics of the potentially vulnerable spots in the SQL queries. In addition, Sania compares the parse trees of the intended SQL query and those resulting after an attack to assess the safety of these spots.

We report our experience with the modeling and detection of scoped invariants. The Xen Virtual Machine Manager is used for a case study. Our research detects a set of essential scoped invariants that are critical to the runtime integrity of Xen. One such property, that the addressable memory limit of a guest OS must not include Xen's code and data, is indispensable for Xen's guest isolation mechanism.

Main characteristics of the proposed approach include the following: (i) it enables the comprehensive specification of workflow elements, providing extensive coverage of all aforementioned perspectives; (ii) it introduces the novel concept of <i>assets</i>, as a means for representing the entities being subject to the execution of workflow tasks; (iii) workflows are defined as ontologies; this, apart from the inherent benefits regarding formal semantics, offers also the advantage of their direct and transparent integration with an ontological information model; (iv) it allows the explicit modelling of both control and data flows, thus being suitable for applications based on either of them or both of them combined; and (v) its expressiveness provides for the <i>in-design</i> expression of sophisticated security constraints.","1751-8806","","","10.1049/iet-sen.2013.0037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786867","","","data flow computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);workflow management software","comprehensive workflow modelling;control flow;core workflow perspectives;data flow;flexibility by design principle;formal semantics;in-design expression;ontological information model;ontology-based approach;sophisticated security constraints","","0","","","","","April 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Because of some characteristics of wireless network, it is not so convenient to build a WIPS in wireless environment as in wire environment. To address this problems, this paper explorer a novel wireless VPN: WBVPN(WTLS-Based VPN). In WBVPN, a logical sole path is built between wireless terminal and its destination, so a IPS engine can detect and prevent the traffics of user. WTLS is introduced firstly and then by WTLS-VPN, we give a basic solution of intrusion prevention in wireless network.

For this reason, many cryptographic security protocols have been developed over the past decades in an attempt to protect the privacy between communicating parties and to reduce the risk of malicious attacks. However, most of the cryptographic algorithms developed so far are based on mathematical models and suffer from many security defects, such as: a brute force attack, factorization problem, and many others. Thus, most of these proposed cryptographic systems are not proven to be completely secure against the main threats of modern networking technologies and computing systems. In this paper, a security framework model for quantum cryptography system which is based on the physical properties of light particles is proposed and all security requirements to assist in ensuring confidentiality between communicating parties are incorporated. The research work in this paper is based on a series of experiments which have been advocated recently by some agencies and researchers who used the quantum technology as a more effective method for solving the key distribution problem. The results of the proposed method is demonstrated and validated by experimental results.","","978-1-4799-3905-3","","10.1109/CyberSec.2014.6913972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6913972","Cryptanalysis;Cryptography;Quantum Key Distribution;Quantum Technology;Security Protocols","Ciphers;Encryption;Optical fibers;Photonics;Public key","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;quantum cryptography","brute force attack;communicating parties;computers;computing systems;cryptographic algorithms;cryptographic security protocols;cryptographic systems;digital network environment;factorization problem;intellectual property;key distribution problem;malicious attacks;mathematical models;modern networking technologies;privacy;putting extra pressure;quantum cryptography system;quantum technology;security defects;security framework model;security requirements","","0","","35","","","April 29 2014-May 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the trust integration method can reduce false alarms and improve the accuracy of the flooding attack detection algorithms.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605798","False Positive;Flooding Attacks;IMS;Trust","Accuracy;Detection algorithms;High definition video;IP networks;Market research;Testing;Training","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;mobile computing;multimedia communication;trusted computing","Hellinger distance;IMS;IP Multimedia Subsystem;Internet applications;SIP flooding attack detection;Tanimoto distance;caller-callee communication activity;cumulative sum;detection system;false positives reduction;legitimate traffic patterns;legitimate user;malicious traffic patterns;mobile services;security problem;trust integration method;trust model;trust value","","1","","21","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, they need a tool to determine if a host is using a network connection for something other than the intended use. A key step in developing this tool is creating statistical models to accurately identify the application protocols of sessions in a network without relying on port numbers, which conventionally identify them. This paper outlines the construction of these models. Specifically, it focuses on the methods used to build them, which included: structuring network data in a database, aggregating packet level data into sessions, and then identifying the key variables. The models employ variables such as the inter-arrival time between packets, the variance of those times, the distribution of TCP control flags and other information available from the packet headers. The paper examines the significance of these explanatory variables and attempts to determine which would be useful in a real-time implementation.","","978-1-4244-2365-1","978-1-4244-2366-8","10.1109/SIEDS.2008.4559677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559677","","Computer networks;Computer security;Design engineering;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Network servers;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;USA Councils","IP networks;Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Internet security;TCP control flag;TCP session classification;government computer network;network database;network traffic monitoring tool;network traffic pattern anomaly detection;packet level data aggregation;statistical approach","","1","","5","","","25-25 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, many attempts have been made to study the intrinsic attributes of these insider attacks but the focus has generally been on the analysis of one or very few particular attacks, or only the survey of various attacks without any performance analysis. Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics. Our simulation-based study shows that flooding attacks like RREQ flood and hello flood drastically increase the routing overhead of the protocol. Route modification attacks such as sinkhole and blackhole are deadly and severely affect the packet efficiency and bring down the throughput to unacceptable ranges.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296111","Blackhole;Hello flood;MANETs;Network layer attacks;RREQ flood;Selective forwarding;Selfish Node;Sinkhole","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;RREQ flood;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;blackhole;blackhole attack;hello flood;malicious AODV;mobile ad hoc networks security;performance metrics;route modification attacks;routing attacks;selective forwarding attack;selfish node behavior;sinkhole;sinkhole attack","","4","","17","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many immune-inspired techniques have been developed with the aim to tackle different computing problems. Network security represents one of the most significant fields that the immune-inspired techniques have been applied to. Given that mobile ad hoc networks have a decentralized nature similar to the human immune system (HIS), immune-inspired security architecture is highly expected to come across different ad hoc security problems, one of which is the malicious node that can disrupt the routing process, masquerade as the legitimate nodes, and impersonate the trusted nodes. In this paper, immune-inspired security architecture for simulating a number of HIS processes for securing mobile ad hoc networks is presented. Both the negative selection and danger theory techniques have been combined along with many other inspired processes to come up with a scalable and robust system.

The current method of analyzing shell code, manual reverse engineering, is time-consuming, requires significant expertise, and would be nearly impossible for a wide-scale polymorphic attack. In this paper, we introduce Spector, a symbolic execution engine that extracts meaningful high-level actions from shell code. Spector's high-level output helps facilitate attack mitigation and classification of different payloads that have the same behavior.

This method learns patterns of normal and intrusive activities to classify that use a set of Gaussian probability distribution functions. The use of maximum likelihood in detection phase has used the deviation between current and reference behavior. GMM is evaluated by dataset KDD99 without any special hardware requirements.

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2006.885306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126299","Attack detection model;classification;data mining;intrusion detection;learning algorithm;model-tuning algorithm;self-organizing map (SOM)","Computer security;Costs;Data security;Feedback;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Predictive models;Protection","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","automatically tuning intrusion detection system;computer system;data-mining;dynamically changing environment;information systems;machine learning techniques;security experts knowledge;security layer;system operators","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","14","2","28","","","April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These systems emerge from inter-agent communication and the collective application of simple rules. The Digital Ants framework is a bio-inspired framework that uses lightweight, mobile agents. The agents communicate using digital pheromones which enable the agents to alert each other of possible cyber security issues. All communication and coordination is both localized and decentralized thereby allowing the framework to scale across the large numbers of devices that will exist in the Smart Grid. Furthermore, being lightweight makes the agents suitable for implementation on devices with limited computational resources.

With Internet connectivity to such devices, the smart grid Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is exposed to attacks by the adversary class. Any compromise of a smart meter may jeopardize the security of not just the household in question, but also the entire neighborhood network and possibly the utility provider's core network. One attack category that may pose a serious threat to the AMI is a meter compromise attack, wherein a smart meter is controlled by the adversary, with the intent of committing energy fraud. In this paper, we present a detection model based on a cumulative analysis of smart meter readings of clustered smart meters. The clustering of smart meters is done based on the physical deployment points of individual smart meters within a neighbourhood area network.

These trends can make control systems vulnerable to cyber attack, which in the case of control systems may impact physical processes causing environmental harm or injury. We present some results of the DATES (Detection and Analysis of Threats to the Energy Sector) project, wherein we adapted and developed several intrusion detection technologies for control systems. The suite of detection technologies was integrated and connected to a commercial security event correlation framework from ArcSight. We demonstrated the efficacy of our detection and correlation solution on two coupled testbed environments. We particularly focused on detection, correlation, and visualization of a network traversal attack, where an attacker penetrates successive network layers to compromise critical assets that directly control the underlying process.

Factors like noise in the audit data, mobility of the nodes and the large amount of network data generated by the network make it difficult to build a normal traffic profile of the network for the purpose of anomaly detection. From this perspective, we present an anomaly detection scheme, called SCAN (stochastic clustering algorithm for network anomaly detection), that has the capability to detect intrusions with high accuracy even when audit data is not complete.

We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible.

Through studying and analyzing the intelligence recognition characteristics of ldquoSoftManrdquo (SM), a novel cooperation model for intrusion detection system based on multiSoftMan alliance (MSMIDS) is proposed to solve these problems. This paper discusses the concepts and various intelligence recognition characteristics in which SoftMan could be applied to the problem of detecting and responding to intrusions. At the same time, the paper visualizes the architecture and system behaviors of the multiSoftMan intrusion detection system. Relevant negotiation control process and cooperation control strategy are presented respectively. The experimental results show that MSMIDS is a more adaptive and efficient system.

We provide the syntax and graphical representation for each node. The nodes allow us to model attacks that require exploitation of vulnerabilities which have dependence on ordering events, sequence-dependant events, conditional failures and mechanisms which involve configuration changes with time.

The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

Documenting such patterns promotes proven design and software reuse. There has been a growing amount of work documenting design patterns for security, however, little work specific to VoIP security. In 2005 NIST released a report on recommendations and best practices for securing VoIP, however it lacks the structure, terminology, and ease-of-understanding needed for both technical and non-technical audiences that is an inherent feature of design patterns. In this paper, we document three design patterns for VoIP implementations related to specific security problems: (1) secure traversal of firewalls and NATs; (2) detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks; and (3) securing against eavesdropping. With many VoIP vendors rushing products to market with overlapping functionality and requirements for interoperability, documenting design patterns is poised to become an important part of secure programming processes for VoIP","","1-4244-0198-4","","10.1109/.2006.1629443","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629443","","Best practices;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Internet telephony;NIST;National security;Network address translation;Sections;Software design","Internet telephony;authorisation;open systems;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;NAT;VoIP security;documenting design pattern;firewall;interoperability;network address translator;secure programming process;voice over Internet protocol","","7","","20","","","10-12 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept of Kolmogorov complexity is used in many applications like spam filtering, data compression, information assurance etc. In this paper, we present the application of Kolmogorov complexity in network security field, particularly for anomaly detection. In order to accomplish that, it is assumed that most of the network attacks change the structure of the traffic. This enforces anomaly and hence subsequent intrusion can be detected if the structure or signature of the traffic flow is investigated. From this notion, we propose a signature based anomaly detection scheme. We show through simulation results that with the help of Kolmogorov complexity, we can detect traffic pattern abnormality in a simplistic way. This detection and quantification of traffic pattern eventually lead to anomaly detection.","","978-1-4244-8128-6","978-1-4244-8127-9","10.1109/APCC.2010.5679753","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679753","IDS;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;kolmogorov complexity","Analytical models;Complexity theory;Computers;Detectors;Indexes;Measurement;Simulation","communication complexity;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Kolmogorov complexity;algorithmic randomness theory;anomaly detection;network attacks;network security;traffic flow;traffic pattern abnormality","","0","","15","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The causal correlation method based on prerequisites and consequences has great advantages in the process of correlating alerts. But it must depend on complicated background knowledge base and has some limits in discovering new attacks. The cluster can aggregate the relational alerts by computing the similarity between alert attributes, as well as can discover new and simple high-level attacks. However, it is difficult to establish the attribute weights in the similarity membership function of two alerts and the threshold of classification similarity value. In order to solve the problem, the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weights and similarity value. In view of the advantages and disadvantages of cluster and correlation, this paper uses improved cluster algorithm to optimize correlation in the process of attack detection.

In this environment, coordinated incident handling across a variety of organizations and incidents is essential for effective response. Current approaches use linear processes developed to handle single incidents with little attention paid to simultaneous or complex attacks encompassing many incidents, to coordination with other organizations, or the ability to scale to the size necessary for large, cross-cutting incidents. We have developed a coordination model for cyber incident management that provides enough structure to enable cooperative operations, but is sufficiently abstract to enable the organizational autonomy and customization essential for effective response for all types of organizations. It is easily understood, straightforward to apply, and versatile enough to overlay on existing organizational processes and structures, both for small, local activities as well as large, cross-organizational ones. This model will enable faster recognition and more rapid escalation of important cyber incidents as well as improving knowledge about such incidents for organizational peers across the community, further enhancing their local response capabilities.","","978-1-4577-1375-0","","10.1109/THS.2011.6107886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107886","","Computational modeling;Computer security;Decision making;Monitoring;Organizations;Standards organizations","groupware;organisational aspects;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","cooperative operation;coordinated incident handling model;customization;cyber incident management;cyber threats;large cross-organizational activities;local response capabilities;organizational autonomy;organizational peers;organizational process;organizational structure","","0","","27","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To test and compare the performances of the proposed detection algorithms, benchmark datasets are required to represent the dynamic nature of the network. Though certain benchmark datasets are available, most datasets are either synthetic or contains suppressed information. In this paper, we introduce SSENet-2014 dataset which is generated in a real network environment. The attacks were generated using attack tools while carrying out normal activities. The description of the SSENet-2014 dataset is given. Then, a comparison is carried out with the most popular intrusion detection dataset, 10% KDD Cup 99. Two clustering approaches of K Means and Self Organizing Map (SOM) have been used in our experiments. Box plot is used to analyze the attributes of the two datasets. The results confirm the variability existing in the attribute values of 10% KDD Cup 99 and SSENet-2014 dataset.
