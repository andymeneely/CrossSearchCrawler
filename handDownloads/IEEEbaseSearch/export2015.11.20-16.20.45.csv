In this paper, we present an efficient GPU-based pattern matching algorithm by leveraging the computational power of GPUs to accelerate the pattern matching operations to increase the over-all processing throughput. From the experiment results, the proposed algorithm achieved a maximum traffic processing throughput of 2.4 Gbit/s.

An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful or even devastating attacks against the routing protocols, including sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. The situation is further aggravated by mobile and harsh network conditions. Traditional cryptographic techniques or efforts at developing trust-aware routing protocols do not effectively address this severe problem. To secure the WSNs against adversaries misdirecting the multihop routing, we have designed and implemented TARF, a robust trust-aware routing framework for dynamic WSNs. Without tight time synchronization or known geographic information, TARF provides trustworthy and energy-efficient route. Most importantly, TARF proves effective against those harmful attacks developed out of identity deception; the resilience of TARF is verified through extensive evaluation with both simulation and empirical experiments on large-scale WSNs under various scenarios including mobile and RF-shielding network conditions. Further, we have implemented a low-overhead TARF module in TinyOS; as demonstrated, this implementation can be incorporated into existing routing protocols with the least effort. Based on TARF, we also demonstrated a proof-of-concept mobile target detection application that functions well against an antidetection mechanism.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081880","Wireless sensor networks;routing protocols;security.","Base stations;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","RF-shielding network;Sybil attacks;TARF;TinyOS;WSN;cryptographic techniques;geographic information;multihop routing;proof-of-concept mobile target detection;replaying routing information;sinkhole attacks;synchronization;trust-aware routing framework;trust-aware routing protocols;wireless sensor networks;wormhole attacks","","14","","38","","2011-11-15","March-April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We illustrate the inadequacy of conventional protocol-specific detection strategies using practical simulated experiments. Furthermore, we study the potential of a cross-layer IDS to overcome the problems associated with the design of MANET IDS. The strengths and weaknesses of single layer and cross layer approaches are examined using simulation-based experiments.

An alternative method is to monitor the host and restore trust if a compromise occurs. When this method is automated, the system is said to be self-healing. One critical requirement of a self-healing system is that the self-healing mechanism itself must not be compromised. Our solution to this requirement is a trusted immutable kernel extension (TIKE) by way of a virtual machine. Using a host operating system as a trusted platform, we discuss a self-healing system that uses existing intrusion detection systems and corresponding self-healing mechanisms to automatically heal the guest operating system once a compromise has occurred.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437855","","Application software;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring;Operating systems;Virtual machining","authorisation;operating system kernels;system recovery;virtual machines","host operating system;intrusion detection system;self-healing system;trusted immutable kernel extension;virtual machine approach","","3","","4","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a new technique that is considered as a stealth attack for web user over wireless networks. The proposed technique creates a crafting spoof web content and sends it to a user before the geniune web content from a website is transmitted to the user.

NNCM IDS consists of Input Reduction System based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Intrusion Detection System, which is represented by three levels committee machine, each based on Back-Propagation Neural Network. To reduce the FNR, the system uses offline System Update, which retrains the networks when new attacks are introduced. The system shows the overall attack detection success of 99.8%.","","","","10.1109/ICAT.2013.6684073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684073","Committee Machine;Intelligent Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion detection;Neural Networks","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Principal component analysis;Training","backpropagation;computer network security;neural nets;principal component analysis","FNR;FPR;NNCM IDS;PCA;attack detection precision;backpropagation neural network;communication technology;computer technology;false negative rate;false positive rate;input reduction system;intrusion detection system;neural network committee machine;offline system update;principal component analysis","","0","","24","","","Oct. 30 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A good way to identify malicious use is through monitoring unusual user activity. To identify these malicious activities various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. This paper proposes Self Configuring Intrusion Detection System (SCIDS) to make tuning automatically. The key idea is to use the binary SLIPPER as a basic module, which is a rule learner based on confidence-rated boosting. This system is evaluated using the NSL KDD intrusion detection dataset. An experimental result shows the SCIDS system with SLIPPER algorithm gives better performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, total misclassification cost and cost per example on NSL-KDD dataset than that of on KDD.","","978-1-4673-2981-1","","10.1109/CICN.2012.181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375215","Confidence value;Intrusion;anomaly detection;attacks;false prediction;misuse detection;tuning","Classification algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Prediction algorithms;Training;Tuning","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","NSL KDD intrusion detection dataset;SCIDS system;SLIPPER algorithm;automatic tuning;binary SLIPPER;computer network;confidence-rated boosting;data mining technique;detection rate;false alarm rate;machine learning technique;malicious activity;malicious use identification;misclassification cost;modern computer system;rule learning;self-configuring intrusion detection system;tuning process;unusual user activity monitoring","","0","","25","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being able to react quickly and in real time is a crucial challenge for the security officers in charge of maintaining those infrastructures operationally. Our state of the art in this field has highlighted that many architectures exist to dynamically support the reaction after the detection of an incident infrastructure. Those architectures are mostly elaborated based on a multi-agent system approach that offers the possibility to work in a decentralized and heterogeneous environment. However, in the meantime, we have observed that those architectures are based on a static assignment of functions to agents and that, as a consequence, isolating an agent or breaking the communication channel between two of them could create serious damage on the management of the crisis. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for making the assignment of functions to agents in the critical architecture dynamic. Our approach exploits the concept of agent responsibility that we assign dynamically to those agents depending on the crisis type and severity. Simultaneously we explain the dynamic assignment of the access rights necessary to perform the obligation linked to these new responsibilities. This dynamic assignment of responsibilities is illustrated based on the architecture defined in the ReD project.","","978-1-4577-0979-1","978-0-7695-4485-4","10.1109/ARES.2011.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6045946","","Business;Computer architecture;Context;Databases;Monitoring;Permission","multi-agent systems;security of data;software architecture;ubiquitous computing","ReD project;communication channel;context-aware solution;crisis access right management;critical IT infrastructures;critical architecture dynamic;critical electronic institutions;dynamic responsibilities assignment;incident infrastructure;multiagent system","","2","","20","","","22-26 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These data may range from multimedia data to sensor data. Along with the size of data, user satisfaction is an important constraint imposing Quality of Service requirements. Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster.

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

With the recent growth of the Internet such security limitations are becoming more and more pressing. Most of the current network intrusion detection systems relay on labeled training data. An Unsupervised CA based anomaly detection technique that was trained with unlabelled data is capable of detecting previously unseen attacks. This new approach, based on the Cellular Automata classifier (CAC) with Genetic Algorithms (GA), is used to classify program behavior as normal or intrusive. Parameters and evolution process for CAC with GA are discussed in detail.

Preliminary experiments with KDD Cup data set show that the CAC classifier with Genetic Algorithms can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate.

The network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes) are designed to identify attacks against networks or a host that are invisible to firewalls, thus providing an additional layer of security. NIDSes detect and filter the malicious packets by inspecting packet payloads to find worm signatures. The payload inspection operation dominates the throughput of an NIDS since every byte of packet payload needs to be examined. At network speeds of 1 Gbps or above, it can be difficult to keep up with intrusion detection in software, and hardware systems or software with hardware assist are normally required. This paper presents FTSE, a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) based pattern matching engine. In this paper we show how FTSE can be used effectively to perform string matching for thousands of strings at multiple-Gigabit speed. We also describe how FTSE can be implemented feasibly with an FPGA/ASIC, a 2.25 Mb TCAM, and a small SSRAM. Our analysis shows that this approach for string matching is very effective and the throughput of our design can achieve up to 8 Gbps for 2,085 snort rules.","1530-1346","0-7695-2373-0","","10.1109/ISCC.2005.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1493825","","Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Inspection;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Search engines;Software systems;Throughput","Internet;authorisation;search engines","ASIC;FPGA;Internet;firewalls;network intrusion detection systems;packet payloads;pattern matching engine;payload inspection;ternary content addressable memory;worm signatures","","1","","16","","","27-30 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism. Our evaluation results show that our proposed decentralized CIDS is more effective than a fully centralized system.","","978-1-4244-2067-4","","10.1109/NOMSW.2007.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509966","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Gold;Government;Intrusion detection;Iron;Laboratories;Software engineering","Internet;Web sites;groupware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet service provider;Web sites;fast-flux network;peer-to-peer network;self-healing collaborative intrusion detection architecture;self-protecting collaborative intrusion detection architecture;trace-back fast-flux phishing domain","","4","","25","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we suggest a new method for correlating alerts based on their attributes. We use time windows along with a classification method to distinguish those received alerts that are correlated with the new alert. Time windows are applied for reducing the number of comparisons and improving the accuracy of correlation. Our experiments which were done on DARPA2000 show that while the cost of comparisons dropped noticeably, the correlation method performed accurately.

Honeypots are not only able to lure a variety of network worms and collect new worm data, but also able to take measures to prevent worms from further spreading. The monitoring center is mainly responsible for further analyzing the suspicious data send back by each honeypot system and extracting new type of worm attack patterns and then sending them to the firewall and ID agents. The firewall and ID agents accept the feedback from the monitoring center to update their own rules, so they are able to respond to the new type of worms.

The root causes behind these vulnerabilities are lack of security awareness, design flaws & implementation bugs. Writing secure code for web application is a complex task as developer emphasis more on implementation of business logic for web application rather than implementing it with secure logic.

The AGAAR method is used to select the most relevant attributes that can represent an intrusion detection dataset. In order to improve the performance of GPLS classifier, a new local search strategy is used with genetic programming operators. The main target of using local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the current. The results shown later indicate that classification accuracy improved from 75.98% to 81.44% after using AGAAR attribute reduction for the NSL-KDD dataset.

Proceedings. 2004 IEEE","20041220","2004","2","","1286","1295 Vol.2","Security issues have been emphasized when mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are employed into military and aerospace fields. We design a novel secure routing protocol for MANETs. This protocol TAODV (Trusted AODV) extends the widely used AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) routing protocol and employs the idea of a trust model to protect routing behaviors in the network layer of MANETs. In the TAODV, trust among nodes is represented by opinion, which is an item derived from subjective logic. The opinions are dynamic and updated frequently as our protocol specification: if one node performs normal communications, its opinion from other nodes' points of view can be increased; otherwise, if one node performs some malicious behaviors, it is ultimately denied by the whole network. A trust recommendation mechanism is also designed to exchange trust information among nodes. The salient feature of TAODV is that, using trust relationships among nodes, there is no need for a node to request and verify certificates all the time. This greatly reduces the computation overheads. Meanwhile, with neighbors' trust recommendations, a node can make objective judgement about another node's trustworthiness to maintain the whole system at a certain security level.","1095-323X","0-7803-8155-6","","10.1109/AERO.2004.1367726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1367726","","Ad hoc networks;Aerodynamics;Aerospace engineering;Computer science;Logic;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","ad hoc on-demand distance vector;aerospace applications;certificate verification;military applications;mobile ad hoc networks;network layer protection;secure ad hoc networks;trust model based routing protocol;trust recommendation mechanism","","20","2","27","","","6-13 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The packet is checked by common detection using the common-rule. If this step detects nothing, the packet is forwarded to its destination. If not, it is passed into the extended detection using the group-rule. Through grouping of similar detection rules, the search space and searching time can be greatly minimized. Using the simplified rule in intrusion detection, the packet inspection time can be largely reduced. With the help of these two steps, fast and effective intrusion detection is possible in network nodes such as router and switch","","","","10.1109/ICACT.2005.245838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461781","","Inspection;Intrusion detection;Packet switching;Switches","telecommunication networks;telecommunication security","common detection;common-rule;extended detection;group-rule;intrusion detection rule grouping;intrusion detection rule simplification;kernel-level intrusion detection method","","0","","9","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Events seemingly unessential by themselves can in reality be a piece of a larger threat. In this regard, different log correlation methods are proposed to improve alert quality and to give a comprehensive view of system security.

Intrusion Detection is a major component in computer security systems that can be classified as Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS), which protects a certain host or system and Network-based Intrusion detection system (NIDS), which protects a network of hosts and systems. This paper addresses Probes attacks or reconnaissance attacks, which try to collect any possible relevant information in the network. Network probe attacks have two types: Host Sweep and Port Scan attacks. Host Sweep attacks determine the hosts that exist in the network, while port scan attacks determine the available services that exist in the network. This paper uses an intelligent system to maximize the recognition rate of network attacks by embedding the temporal behavior of the attacks into a TDNN neural network structure. The proposed system consists of five modules: packet capture engine, preprocessor, pattern recognition, classification, and monitoring and alert module. We have tested the system in a real environment where it has shown good capability in detecting attacks. In addition, the system has been tested using DARPA 1998 dataset with 100% recognition rate.

They are a security resource that does not have any production or authorized activity but have an important use in intrusion prevention, detection and information gathering.

In modern integrated systems, there are four potential modes of attack available to an adversary: 1 physical only attack, 2 cyber only attack, 3 physical-enabled cyber attack, 4 cyber-enabled physical attack. Blended attacks involve an adversary working in one domain to reduce system effectiveness in another domain. This enables the attacker to penetrate further into the overall layered defenses. Existing vulnerability assessment (VA) processes and software tools which predict facility vulnerabilities typically evaluate the physical and cyber domains separately. Vulnerabilities which result from the integration of cyber-physical control systems are not well characterized and are often overlooked by existing assessment approaches. In this paper, we modified modification of the timely detection methodology, used for decades in physical security VAs, to include cyber components. The Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool (PACRAT) prototype illustrates an integrated vulnerability assessment that includes cyber-physical interdependencies. Information about facility layout, network topology, and emplaced safeguards is used to evaluate how well suited a facility is to detect, delay, and respond to attacks, to identify the pathways most vulnerable to attack, and to evaluate how often safeguards are compromised for a given threat or adversary type. We have tested the PACRAT prototype on critical infrastructure facilities and the results are promising. Future work includes extending the model to prescribe the recommended security improvements via an automated cost-benefit analysis.","","978-1-4673-4894-2","978-1-4673-4895-9","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497883","Modeling;Power Industry;Risk analysis;Security;Simulation","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer security;Delays;Organizations;Software tools","cost-benefit analysis;critical infrastructures;risk analysis;security of data","PACRAT;Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool;attack delay;attack detection;attack response;automated cost-benefit analysis;blended attack;critical asset security;critical infrastructure facility;cyber components;cyber only attack;cyber-enabled physical attack;cyber-physical control system;cyber-physical interdependency;cyber-physical security vulnerability assessment integration;emplaced safeguard;facility layout;facility vulnerability prediction;high value asset security;layered defense;network topology;physical only attack;physical-enabled cyber attack;security improvement;software tool;system effectiveness reduction","","0","","5","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is, new members can join and current members can leave at any time. Instead of individual rekeying, i.e., performing a rekey right after each join or leave request is received, periodic batch rekeying has been proposed to alleviate rekeying overhead in resource-constrained wireless networks. The issue of how often rekey operations should be performed, however, has not been addressed. In this paper, we develop a stochastic Petri net (SPN) model to identify the optimal batch rekey interval to minimize periodic rekey overhead while satisfying application-specific constraints in rekey delay and secrecy violation. We develop three new threshold-based schemes, demonstrate the optimal rekey intervals for these three schemes, and identify the best scheme that should be adopted for periodic batch rekeying to minimize rekey overhead, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational and environmental conditions.","","0-7803-9305-8","","10.1109/WIRLES.2005.1549463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1549463","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Collaborative work;Computer science;Cryptography;Delay;Security;Stochastic processes;Teleconferencing;Wireless networks","Petri nets;optimisation;radio networks;stochastic processes;telecommunication security","application-specific constraints;batch rekey interval;dynamic network;group communications security;group membership;periodic rekey overhead minimization;rekey delay;resource-constrained wireless networks;secrecy violation;stochastic Petri net model","","0","","13","","","13-16 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes, three intrusion detection systems namely PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement with respect to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-3-8007-3092-6","978-3-00-024883-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632412","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","data-dependent decision fusion;feature vector;intrusion detection systems;neural network supervised learner unit;performance enhancement;sensor fusion","","2","","30","","","June 30 2008-July 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, custom Web-based applications may introduce vulnerabilities that are overlooked even by the most security-conscious server administrators. Consequently, Web servers are a popular target for hackers. To mitigate the security exposure associated with Web servers, intrusion detection systems are deployed to analyze and screen incoming requests. The goal is to perform early detection of malicious activity and possibly prevent more serious damage to the protected site. Even though intrusion detection is critical for the security of Web servers, the intrusion detection systems available today only perform very simple analyses and are often vulnerable to simple evasion techniques. In addition, most systems do not provide sophisticated attack languages that allow a system administrator to specify custom, complex attack scenarios to be detected. We present WebSTAT, an intrusion detection system that analyzes Web requests looking for evidence of malicious behavior. The system is novel in several ways. First of all, it provides a sophisticated language to describe multistep attacks in terms of states and transitions. In addition, the modular nature of the system supports the integrated analysis of network traffic sent to the server host, operating system-level audit data produced by the server host, and the access logs produced by the Web server. By correlating different streams of events, it is possible to achieve more effective detection of Web-based attacks.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254308","","Application software;Computer hacking;Computer science;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;Web sites;computer crime;file servers","Web-based applications;Web-based attacks;WebSTAT intrusion detection system;World-Wide Web servers;operating system-level audit data;server host;sophisticated attack languages","","26","2","25","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a kernel level authentication prototype to verify the originality of each suspicious process during runtime. The verification and authentication tasks are performed well in advance before each suspicious process getting the kernel service. We designed, implemented, and assessed the prototype in Windows.

Organizations are devising and deploying new solutions for analyzing, monitoring and predicting these insider threats. However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern.

Self-securing storage addresses client and user account problems by transparently auditing accesses and versioning data within each storage server. Thus, PASIS clients use threshold schemes to protect themselves from compromised servers, and self-securing servers use full access auditing to protect their data from compromised clients. Together, these techniques can provide truly survivable storage systems","","0-7695-1212-7","","10.1109/DISCEX.2001.932171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932171","","Availability;Computer architecture;Data security;Encoding;Information security;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network servers;Pervasive computing;Protection;Secure storage","auditing;client-server systems;configuration management;digital storage;encoding;fault tolerant computing;security of data;storage management","PASIS architecture;accidental problems;client systems;client-side problems;compromised clients;compromised servers;data access;data encoding;data maintenance;data versioning;interconnection networks;malicious problems;self-securing servers;self-securing storage;server connections;server-side problems;storage servers;survivable storage systems;threshold schemes;transparent access auditing;trust distribution;user accounts","","13","16","30","","","2001","12 Jun 2001-14 Jun 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With their ability to rapidly propagate, these worms increasingly threaten the Internet hosts and services. Not only can they exploit unknown vulnerabilities but can also change their own representations on each new infection or can encrypt their payloads using a different key per infection. They have many variations in the signatures of the same worm thus, making their fingerprinting very difficult. Therefore, signature-based defenses and traditional security layers miss these stealthy and persistent threats. This paper provides a detailed survey to outline the research efforts in relation to detection of modern zero-day malware in form of zero-day polymorphic worms.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2014.022714.00160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766917","Detection Systems;Polymorphic worms;Signature Generation;Zero-day attacks;Zero-day malware","Grippers;Internet;Malware;Monitoring;Payloads;Vectors","Internet;invasive software","Internet security;fingerprinting;key per infection;payload encryption;security layers;signature-based defenses;zero-day malware;zero-day polymorphic worm detection techniques","","1","","140","","2014-03-14","Third Quarter 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a self-configuration approach to control and manage the security mechanisms of large scale networks. Self-configuration enables the system to automatically configure security system and change the configuration of its resources and their operational policies at runtime in order to manage the system security. Our self-configuration approach is implemented using two software modules: component management interface (CMI) to specify the configuration and operational policies associated with each component that can be a hardware resource or a software component; and component runtime manager (CRM) that manages the component operations using the policies defined in CMI. We have used the self-configuration framework to experiment with and evaluate different mechanisms and strategies to detect and protect against a wide range of network attacks.","1541-7719","978-0-7695-2891-5","","10.1109/EDOC.2007.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4383985","","Computer network management;Computer networks;Control systems;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection;Resource management;Runtime;Security;Taxonomy","configuration management;object-oriented programming;security of data","component management interface;component runtime manager;configuration policy;large scale networks;network attack;network security;self-configuration;software component;software module;system security","","2","","35","","","15-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Methodology for Evaluation of Host-Based Intrusion Prevention Systems and Its Application","Labbe, K.G.; Rowe, N.C.; Fulp, J.D.","US Naval Postgraduate Sch., Monterey, CA","Information Assurance Workshop, 2006 IEEE","20060710","2006","","","378","379","Host-based intrusion-prevention systems are currently popular technologies which try to prevent exploits from succeeding on a host. They are like host-based intrusion-detection systems (P. E. Proctor, 2001) but include means to automatically take actions once malicious activities or code are discovered. This can include terminating connections, services, or ports; refusing commands; blocking packets from specific Internet addresses; initiating tracing of packets; and sending modified packets back to a user. Automated responses to exploits can be quick without human intervention. Around ten commercial vendors are currently offering intrusion-prevention products (N. Desai, May 2006), and Snort-Inline is a popular open-source tool. Total intrusion prevention is a difficult goal to achieve, since it takes time to recognize an exploit and by then the damage may be done. So it is important to have a way to test the often-broad claims of intrusion-prevention products. The testing we propose is not as comprehensive as that offered by attack-traffic simulators like Skaion's TGS (www.skaion.com) or by the DETER testbed (www.deterlab.net). But attack-traffic simulators, even when up-to-date, only model broad characteristics of attacks and not their context-dependent behavior, so they can produce significant numbers of false negatives. DETER emulates rather than executes malicious software to provide added safety, which is not quite the same. DETER also imposes several bureaucratic obstacles for getting approval for experiments and obtaining time on their hardware to run them; this bureaucracy requires motivation and time to navigate. For quick testing in depth of a new product that has not been evaluated in DETER, or for finding reasons to rule out a product, a simpler approach that is easier to set up is required","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652120","","Context modeling;File servers;Hardware;Humans;Open source software;Operating systems;Payloads;Software safety;System testing;Web and internet services","public domain software;security of data","attack-traffic simulators;host-based intrusion-prevention systems;malicious activities;popular open-source tool","","0","","5","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This vision can be accomplished by integrating the existing and emerging access networks via a common Internet Protocol (IP) based platform. Nevertheless, owing to the inter-worked infrastructure, a malicious security threat in such a heterogeneous network is no more confined to its originating network domain, but can easily be propagated to other access networks. To address these security concerns, this paper proposes a biologically inspired security framework that governs the cooperation among network entities to identify security attacks, to perform security updates, and to inhibit attacks propagation in the heterogeneous network. The proposed framework incorporates two principal security components, in the form of anomaly detection framework and security control framework. Several plausible principles from two fields of biology, in particular the human immune system (HIS) and epidemiology have been adopted into the proposed security framework. Performance evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed biologically inspired security framework in detecting malicious anomalies such as denial-of-service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and worms, as well as restricting their propagations in the heterogeneous network.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2010.1012.0360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5668982","Heterogeneous network security;biologically inspired security;danger theory;epidemiology;human immune system","Biological system modeling;Computer crime;Spectral analysis","complex networks;computer network security;invasive software;protocols","Internet protocol;biologically inspired anomaly detection;complex heterogeneous networks;denial-of-service;distributed DoS;future generation networks;human immune system;security control frameworks;worms","","4","","35","","","December 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

New intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which are based on sophisticated algorithms rather than current signature-base detections are in demand. In this paper, we propose a new data-mining based technique for intrusion detection using an ensemble of binary classifiers with feature selection and multiboosting simultaneously. Our model employs feature selection so that the binary classifier for each type of attack can be more accurate, which improves the detection of attacks that occur less frequently in the training data. Based on the accurate binary classifiers, our model applies a new ensemble approach which aggregates each binary classifierpsilas decisions for the same input and decides which class is most suitable for a given input. During this process, the potential bias of certain binary classifier could be alleviated by other binary classifierspsila decision. Our model also makes use of multiboosting for reducing both variance and bias. The experimental results show that our approach provides better performance in terms of accuracy and cost than the winner entry of the dasiaKnowledge Development and Data miningpsila (KDD) psila99 cup challenge.

The transport scrubber's role is to convert ambiguous network flows into well-behaved flows that are unequivocally interpreted by all downstream endpoints. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP/IP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks-attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection-on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance. The application protocol scrubbing mechanism is used as a substrate for building fail-closed active network based intrusion detections systems that can respond to attacks by eluding or modifying application data flows in real-time.

Consequently, using statistical methods to analyze intrusion logs in order to present evidentiary values in courts of law are often refuted as baseless and inadmissible evidences regardless of the input spent to generate the reports and whether the reports are well-grounded evidences or not. Sometimes, complainants are often bewildered and confused because it is almost certain that the prime suspects will be absolved in courts of law. These are tragic developments to computer security experts, corporate and private organizations that leverage on the usage of the Internet facilities to boost service delivery, business activities and profitability. Thus, this paper presents non-statistical metrics that adopt Serialization Modelling Method (S2M) to improve interpretations of intrusion logs. The approach instantiates tokens and serializes alerts triggered by Snort using well-defined values. Experiments illustrate that duplicate tokens or patterns of alerts that exhibit increased propensity are indicative of redundant alerts to a certain degree.","","978-1-4673-0060-5","","10.1109/EMS.2011.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6131185","Forensics networking;Intrusion Detection System;alerts aggregation;redundant alerts","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Correlation;Forensics;Measurement;Redundancy;Statistical analysis","Internet;security of data","Internet facilitiy;computer security;cyber crime;forensic investigation;network intrusion;nonstatistical metrics;serialization modelling method","","0","","14","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
