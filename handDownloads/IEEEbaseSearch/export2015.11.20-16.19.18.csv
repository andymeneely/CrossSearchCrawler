Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542","","Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity","","0","","20","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the purpose of this paper we consider that external attacks are generated by the attackers or from hosts outside the organization, and internal attacks are generated by malicious insiders within the organization. Insider attacks have always been challenging to deal with as insiders have legitimate and physical access to the systems within the organization, and they have knowledge of the organization networks and more importantly, are aware of the security environment enforced within the organization. In this paper we propose novel trust enhanced security techniques to deal with the insider attack problem. Our architecture detects the attacks by monitoring the user activity as well as the state of the system using trusted computing in exposing and analyzing suspicious behaviour. We will demonstrate how an insider can exploit the weakness in the systems to generate different attacks and how our architecture can help to prevent such attacks.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680886","Insider Threat;Security Architecture;Secuurity Attacks;Trusted Computing","Computer architecture;Monitoring;Organizations;Runtime;Security;Servers;Software","behavioural sciences computing;security of data;trusted computing","external attacks;insider threat detection;internal attacks;legitimate access;malicious insiders;organization networks;physical access;security environment;suspicious behaviour;trust enhanced security architecture;trusted computing;user activity monitoring","","0","","15","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","","978-1-4673-0296-8","978-1-4673-0297-5","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","0","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A significant number of malicious attacks against the security of such networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization.

As an effective clustering method, PDDP is unusual in that it is divisive, as opposed to agglomerative, and operates by splitting clusters into two smaller sub-clusters repeatedly. The splits are not based on any distance or similarity measure. By introducing the idea of PDDP method to intrusion detection, the number of clusters is able to be determined automatically. PDDPC have two advantages, one is that the singular value decomposition (SVD) can be stopped at the first singular value/vector and this makes PDDPC significantly more computational advantages, the other is that no distance and similarity measure is needed to define. The results of the experiments with KDD CUP1999 data show that this scheme can improve the detection quality effectively.

During a BV's interaction with power grid, it may be in one of the following states: charging, fully-charged (FC), and discharging. In this paper, we identify that there are unique security challenges in a BV's different battery states. Accordingly, we propose a battery status-aware authentication scheme (BASA) to address the issue for V2G networks. In BASA, 1) an aggregated-identifier is proposed during the charging-to-FC state transition to ensure that BVs can be authenticated without disclosing their real identities; 2) selective disclosure based challenge-response authentication is presented during the FC-to-discharging phase to realize anonymous data transmission; 3) an aggregated-status is reported during the discharging-to-charging transition in order to hide a BV's power level from an aggregator. In addition, we perform comprehensive security analysis, which shows that BASA achieves both privacy preservation and security protection during battery state transitions. The analysis also indicates that battery status awareness is crucial for BVs' secure operations for V2G networks in smart grid.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2224387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461499","Authentication;battery status;privacy;security;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Authentication;Batteries;Privacy;Smart grids;Vehicles","automobiles;battery powered vehicles;power engineering computing;smart power grids","BASA;BV;FC-to-discharging phase;V2G networks;battery state transitions;battery status-aware authentication scheme;battery vehicles;challenge-response authentication;data transmission;discharging-to-charging transition;information services;power grid;power services;privacy preservation;security protection;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid","","4","","26","","2013-02-13","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings 17th Annual","20020807","2001","","","252","261","We introduce a new method for detecting intrusions based on the temporal behavior of applications. It builds on an existing method of application intrusion detection developed at the University of New Mexico that uses a system call sequence as a signature. Intrusions are detected by comparing the signature of the intrusion and that of the normal application. But when the system call sequences generated by the intrusion and the normal application are sufficiently similar, this method cannot work. By extending system call signature to incorporate temporal information related to the application, we form a richer signature. Analysis shows that the temporal behavior for many applications is relatively stable. We exclude high variance data when creating a normal database to characterize an application with a temporal signature. It can then be the basis for future comparisons in an intrusion detection system. This paper discusses experiments that test the effectiveness of the temporal signature on different applications, alternative intrusions, and in various environments. The results show that by choosing appropriate analysis methods and experimentally adjusting the parameters, intrusions are readily detected. Finally, we give some comparisons between the temporal signature method and the system call method.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991541","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991541","","Application software;Buffer overflow;Computer crime;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Operating systems;Security;Testing;Time measurement","security of data;system monitoring;temporal logic","applications;call sequence as signature;intrusion detection;system call method;temporal behavior;temporal information;temporal signatures","","6","","17","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then propose regular expression rewrite techniques that can effectively reduce memory usage. Further, we develop a grouping scheme that can strategically compile a set of regular expressions into several engines, resulting in remarkable improvement of regular expression matching speed without much increase in memory usage. We implement a new DFA-based packet scanner using the above techniques.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-6442-5","","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374","DFA;Deep packet inspection;FPGA;pipeline;string matching","Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pipelines;Programmable logic arrays;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;ClamAV;Snort;anti-virus systems;field programmable gate array;high performance multipattern string matching;high-speed deep packet inspection;linear pipeline;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input;network intrusion detection;pipelined processing;scalable multipipeline architecture;scalable pipeline architecture","","2","","21","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In LID security routing mechanism, the intrusion detection is performed locally using the previous node of the attacker node instead of performing the intrusion detection via the source node as in Source Intrusion Detection (SID) security routing mechanism.

Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5658-6","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030322","Database Security;Inter-Transaction Dependency;Inter-Transaction Sequence;Intrusion Detection;State machine","Authentication;Databases","data mining;security of data","access control;anomaly detection;data mining;database intrusion detection;database transaction level;encryption;intertransaction level;user task level","","0","","12","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this model we try to represent the complex case structural information through class hierarchy. The new method not only overcomes limitations that traditional attribute-value case representation can not represent complex cases, but also combines domain knowledge and case representation through constraint rules. In the aspect of case similarity, we divide it into two categories: the intra- class similarity and the inter-class similarity, which shows more accurate and convenient.

Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801","Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks","","6","","17","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

GNP is a graph-based evolutionary algorithm and can extract many important class association rules by making use of the distinguished representation ability of the graph structures. In this paper, a probabilistic classification is proposed and combined with the class association rule mining of GNP, and applied to Network intrusion detection for the performance evaluation. The proposed method creates a joint probability density function of normal and intrusion accesses and use it to efficiently classify new access data into normal, known intrusion or unknown intrusion.

A novel 'multiple' smoothing parameters, which is different from the standard algorithm in which only single smoothing parameter was adopted (Matlab neural network toolbox, for example), were assigned to GRNN model. K-means clustering algorithm was developed so as to reduce the number of smoothing parameters. The training data was firstly partitioned into groups (the number of groups was much smaller than that of training samples) using K-means clustering. A smoothing parameter was then assigned to this group. A recently emerging estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) was employed to optimize the multiple smoothing parameters. EDA presented in this paper was a kind of optimization algorithm based on Gaussian probability distribution. As a case study, the proposed approach was applied to establish a non-linear model between the parameters of the coal-fired boiler and the NOx emissions. The results showed that the number of cluster has significant effect on the predictive accuracy of GRNN model. GRNN model with multiple smoothing parameters showed better agreement than that with only one smoothing parameter.

It has been estimated that 40% of unplanned system downtime is due to software application failures. This paper describes a project to demonstrate survivability at the application layer. The goal is to replace a lost essential service by another service that supports mission fulfillment in a different but equivalent way. Application-level survivability, the ability to reconfigure an application to transparently maintain services when part of a system becomes unavailable, is the most flexible and comprehensive approach to supporting mission fulfillment since it can provide assurance over all lower layers within a networked system. We have developed resumable FTP, an application based on RFC 959, which has the ability to resume the download of a file after the download has been interrupted by users or by lower layers (loss of connection). FTP continues to be the most common method for bulk data transfer across networks and as high-performance network infrastructures have become established, default implementations of FTP have not kept pace. More importantly, FTP is similar to a class of future applications that use separate channels for data and control enabling long-lasting sessions. We present the design and use of rFTP and conclude with future architectures for providing application-layer survivability in other domains.","","0-7803-7225-5","","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985772","","Application software;Computer bugs;Computer science;Computer security;Internet;Protocols;Resumes;Switches;Telephony;Web pages","Internet;computer network reliability;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","Internet attacks;Java;RFC 959;application-level survivability;bulk data transfer;control channels;data channels;file downloading;high-performance network infrastructure;lower-layer security detection;lower-layer security prevention;networked system;protocol stack;rFTP;resumable FTP;software application failure;system downtime","","1","","17","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying ""blindspots"" in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing","data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data","attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing","","1","","30","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm. Test results show that comparing with previous clustering methods, IE&FSDM algorithm improve the detection rate of anomaly behavior and reduce the false alarm rate.","","","","10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973690","Anomaly Detection;Clustering;Discrepancy Metric;Information Entropy;k-menas","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information entropy;Measurement;Testing;Training","entropy;pattern clustering;security of data","DR value;FAR value;IE&FSDM algorithm;KDD CUP1999 dataset;anomaly detection;clustering analysis;frequency sensitive discrepancy metric;information entropy;intrusion detection technology;k-means clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","7-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MNEMOSYNE provides improved logging features, such as multiple streams, support for cross-stream queries, and dynamic remote reconfiguration. By integrating MNEMOSYNE with real-time intrusion detection capability, it is possible to provide incident analysis functionality and effective evidence collection, without having to maintain complete traffic logs.

Moreover, it embeds a distributed alert ranking system that makes it possible to evaluate the real level of risk represented by a security alert generated by a NIDS, and it allows independent network departments to exchange early warnings about critical threats. Thanks to these features, a system administrator can focus on the few alerts that represent a real threat for the controlled infrastructure and can be notified about the most dangerous intrusions before his department is attacked.","","978-1-4244-7547-6","","10.1109/CIT.2010.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578127","Alert ranking;distributed IDS;early warning;intrusion detection systems","Computer architecture;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers;Software","peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","alert management;distributed alert ranking system;distributed intrusion detection architectures;early security warnings;networked information systems complexity;peer-to-peer cooperation schemes;selective security warnings;system administrators;threat detection","","3","","38","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Securing NDP becomes an important research area as the Internet is deployed widely in public areas, such as airports, where the trust is not necessary between hosts, which may expose them to attacks. In addition, securing network from inside is necessary, particularly when security hierarchical exist between users. One of the major problems in conducting research on IPv6 security is the absence of a reliable dataset, which is essential in testing and evaluating the proposed solutions. This research develops a reliable dataset of IPv6 NDP by capturing the normal and abnormal behaviors of NDP using specific dependable tools. Reliable dataset helps to understand and distinguish between normal behavior and anomalies in IPv6 NDP.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7293014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293014","","IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Protocols;Reliability","IP networks;computer network security;transport protocols;trusted computing","IPv6 NDP;IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol;IPv6 security;Internet;attacks;local area network;network security;reliable behavioral dataset;reliable dataset;security issues;trust","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","4","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among several evolutionary techniques, Steady State Genetic-based Machine Leaning Algorithm (SSGBML) will be used to detect intrusions with Zeroth Level Classifier system (ZCS) are investigated here. Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations. ZCS is used to play the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether the current message is normal or intrusion and receiving feedback from environment.

International Conference on","20091009","2009","2","","237","244","Managed security service providers (MSSPs) must manage and monitor thousands of intrusion detection sensors. The sensors often vary by manufacturer and software version, making the problem of creating generalized tools to separate true attacks from false positives particularly difficult. Often times it is useful from an operations perspective to know if a particular sensor is acting out of character. We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks. We evaluate a set of time-based Markovian heuristics against a simple compression algorithm and show that we are able to detect the existence of all attacks which were manually identified by security personnel, drastically reduce the number of false positives, and identify attacks which were overlooked during manual evaluation.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284168","anomaly detection;hidden markov model;intrusion detection;markov chain","Conference management;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Needles;Sensor systems","data compression;hidden Markov models;security of data","anomaly detection techniques;compression algorithm;deviation detection;false alarm suppression;generalized tools;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection data sets;intrusion detection sensors;managed security service providers;software version;time-based Markovian heuristics","","0","","28","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this reason, there are needed new systems and models to detect the intrusion in Tor networks. In this paper, we present the application of Neural Networks (NNs) for intrusion detection in Tor networks. We used the Back propagation NN and constructed a Tor server and a Deep Web browser (client). Then, the client sends the data browsing to the Tor server using the Tor network. We used Wireshark Network Analyzer to get the data and then use the Back propagation NN to make the approximation.

Having this information would speed the search for zero-day exploits and designate precisely which system components could have been affected by an intrusion. Unfortunately, it may be several months after the infection before any latent effect is observed and there is no way to attest which, if any, of the affected processes are related to the original exploit. In addition, the system under observation cannot be trusted to record the necessary forensic information as the infection may deliberately hide its presence. These problems subsequently hamper system recovery and data verification efforts. This paper describes a novel forensic hypervisor design that provides coarse-grained process tracking and utilizes next generation Intel virtualization technology, leveraging extended page tables and enforcing MULTICS style protection techniques. Custom forensic introspection techniques are used to walk the extended page tables to inspect a virtual machines state and track the associated processes. A description of the steps necessary to perform tracking are presented; the real-time performance impact is quantified at less than 11μs for each system call.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-1729-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415817","Forensics;Introspection;Operating Systems;Virtualization","Forensics;Hardware;Kernel;Program processors;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","digital forensics;formal verification;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","MULTICS style protection technique;computing environment;custom forensic introspection;data verification;exploit discovery;forensic hypervisor design;forensic information;interaction history;intrusion;memory;next generation Intel virtualization technology;operating system;page table;process tracking;real-time forensic reconstruction;server;system component;system recovery;virtual machine","","1","","22","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once confined to the network, they are now conducted over the hypercall interface. These attacks are initiated by malicious, unprivileged guests with a goal of incapacitating hosting hypervisors. Because they are not packet-based, they cannot be detected or prevented using network security measures. The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls. The assumption is that exploits will be manifested as previously-unobserved sequences of hypercalls.

One of the most promising ways to provide security is Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). The heart of almost every IDSs is a string matching algorithm, which is a very computational intensive task. Network Processors (NPs), a specialized multiprocessor, can provide flexibility and high performance for string matching. This paper evaluates several key string matching algorithms using a comprehensive simulation framework. Starting from a uniprocessor profiling, the framework constructs task graphs for string matching algorithms. Then task graphs are mapped onto NPs together with other network applications. The system throughput is determined by the analytical performance model. With this framework, we can evaluate the performance of different string matching algorithms on NPs. Our results show that shift table based algorithms (SFKSearch and Wu-Manber) and finite automaton based Aho-Corasick are complementary: SFKSearch and Wu-Manber do better job in NPs for good packet and larger pattern length due to better inter-task parallelism and shifting; Aho-Corasick does not depend on minimal pattern length and shows relative small processing cost variation between bad and good packets.","","978-1-4244-1967-8","978-1-4244-1968-5","10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4493512","","Analytical models;Automata;Computational modeling;Costs;Heart;Internet;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Performance analysis;Throughput","security of data;string matching","Internet;analytical performance model;intrusion detection systems;network processors;string matching algorithms","","1","","21","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent malware are not only becoming more sophisticated, but have also demonstrated a trend to make use of components, which can easily be distributed through the Internet to develop newer and better malware. As a result, the key problem facing Cloud security is to cope with identifying diverse sets of malware. This paper presents a method of detecting malware by identifying the symptoms of malicious behaviour as opposed to looking for the malware itself. This can be compared to the use of symptoms in human pathology, in which study of symptoms direct physicians to diagnosis of a disease or possible causes of illnesses. The main advantage of shifting the attention to the symptoms is that a wide range of malicious behaviour can result in the same set of symptoms. We propose the creation of Forensic Virtual Machines (FVM), which are mini Virtual Machines (VM) that can monitor other VMs to discover the symptoms. In this paper, we shall present a framework to support the FVMs so that they collaborate with each other in identifying symptoms by exchanging messages via secure channels. The FVMs report to a Command & Control module that collects and correlates the information so that suitable remedial actions can take place in real-time. The Command & Control can be compared to the physician who infers possibility of an illness from the occurring symptoms. In addition, as FVMs make use of the computational resources of the system we will present an algorithm for sharing of the FVMs so that they can be guided to search for the symptoms in the VMs with higher priority.","1541-7719","978-1-4673-2444-1","","10.1109/EDOC.2012.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337247","Cloud;security;virtualisation","Algorithm design and analysis;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Software;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","FVM;Internet;VM;cloud computing;cloud security;command & control module;forensic virtual machines;human pathology;identifying symptoms;malicious behaviour;malware detection;virtual machines","","5","","19","","","10-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper analyzes existing VMM-based models of malware detection. ""Out-of-the-box"" detection, active defense model, or In-VM models have the same defects: (1) on top of the VMM, two virtual machines are used, one by the user (Guest OS) and the other as monitor (Host OS), and (2) users cannot directly view the detection results nor configure detection system in the Guest OS. A layered detection model is proposed to overcome these issues, the bottom layer is responsible for security for the layers above it. Detection results can be directly displayed in the Guest OS, and users can view and configure the detection system. Furthermore, the detection model can isolate malware attacks to the detection system in the Guest OS. Experiment results show the validity of the proposed detection model.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296123","In-VM model;layered model;malware detection;network security;virtual machine","Graphics;Hardware;Malware;Mice;Monitoring;User interfaces","invasive software;operating systems (computers);system monitoring;virtual machines","Guest OS;Host OS;In-VM model;VMM;active defense model;layered malware detection model;malicious codes;malware attack isolation;out-of-the-box detection;virtual machine monitor-based antimalware systems","","0","","12","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, DPI deployment should be concerned its black boxing results such as ISPs unilateral measure, privacy infringement, advertisement implantation. When ISPs deploy the applications of DPI popularly, it is lack of sufficient attention from users, policy-makers, and researchers to rethink its social adverse impact.

In dynamic and decentralized settings where the traffic, topology and channel states may vary over time and the communication between agents is impractical, it is important to formulate and study games of incomplete information and fully distributed learning algorithms which for each agent requires a minimal amount of information regarding the remaining agents. In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts. Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics, logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics. We apply the results to a class of security games in which the attacker and the defender adopt different learning schemes due to differences in their rationality levels and the information they acquire.","0743-1546","978-1-4244-7745-6","","10.1109/CDC.2010.5718053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718053","","Approximation algorithms;Equations;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Stochastic processes;Trajectory","approximation theory;differential equations;learning (artificial intelligence);stochastic games","agent communication;best response dynamics;deterministic ordinary differential equation;fictitious play dynamics;game theory;heterogeneous learning algorithm;incomplete information context;logit dynamics;security games;standard replicator dynamics;stochastic approximation techniques;zero-sum stochastic games","","7","","12","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fundamental building blocks of this system is the concept of building chronological ordered sequence of events which represent the details of the attacks (ARP). Then by applying the three weighting models we are able to provide more realistic views of attacks. This concept of weighting, where different events are assigned different weights, serves as the basis of the alert regression profile allowing the use of thresholds. Thresholds represent the fine balance between the accuracy of the alert and its timeliness.

In this paper, we propose and implement a secure multicast protocol in intrusion detection systems especially for MANETS. By using this protocol, all the acknowledgement packets are encrypted by using hybrid cryptography. Using this cryptography, unwanted network overhead will be reduced.

Indeed, existing techniques for network flow sanitization are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks, and solutions proposed for microdata anonymity cannot be directly applied to network traces. In our previous research, we proposed an obfuscation technique for network flows, providing formal confidentiality guarantees under realistic assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. In this paper, we identify the threats posed by the incremental release of network flows, we propose a novel defense algorithm, and we formally prove the achieved confidentiality guarantees.

"Improving network management with software defined networking","Hyojoon Kim; Feamster, N.","","Communications Magazine, IEEE","20130214","2013","51","2","114","119","Network management is challenging. To operate, maintain, and secure a communication network, network operators must grapple with low-level vendor-specific configuration to implement complex high-level network policies. Despite many previous proposals to make networks easier to manage, many solutions to network management problems amount to stop-gap solutions because of the difficulty of changing the underlying infrastructure. The rigidity of the underlying infrastructure presents few possibilities for innovation or improvement, since network devices have generally been closed, proprietary, and vertically integrated. A new paradigm in networking, software defined networking (SDN), advocates separating the data plane and the control plane, making network switches in the data plane simple packet forwarding devices and leaving a logically centralized software program to control the behavior of the entire network. SDN introduces new possibilities for network management and configuration methods. In this article, we identify problems with the current state-of-the-art network configuration and management mechanisms and introduce mechanisms to improve various aspects of network management. We focus on three problems in network management: enabling frequent changes to network conditions and state, providing support for network configuration in a highlevel language, and providing better visibility and control over tasks for performing network diagnosis and troubleshooting. The technologies we describe enable network operators to implement a wide range of network policies in a high-level policy language and easily determine sources of performance problems. In addition to the systems themselves, we describe various prototype deployments in campus and home networks that demonstrate how SDN can improve common network management tasks.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2013.6461195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461195","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Control systems;Home automation;Logic gates;Software radio;Telecommunication network management","computer network management;high level languages;telecommunication security","SDN;complex high-level network policy;high-level policy language;logically centralized software program;low-level vendor-specific configuration;network management;packet forwarding device;secure communication;software defined networking;stop-gap solution","","66","1","","","","February 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With increasing use of online services and attacks on these services, the importance of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detection of DoS/DDoS attacks has also grown. Different techniques such as data mining, neural network, genetic algorithms, pattern recognition are being used to design IDS. Tree based classifier is one of the widely used data mining technique for design of IDS. This paper evaluates variation in performance of REPTree classifier for intrusion detection when used in combination with different data pre-processing and feature selection methods. Experimental results prove that accuracy of REPTree classifier is improved and performs better than other tree based classifiers when used in combination with feature selection and data pre-processing methods.","","","","10.1109/ICGCE.2013.6823527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823527","Denial of Service Attack;Feature selection;Intrusion Detection System;REPTree","Accuracy;Computer crime;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Decision trees;Testing;Training","computer network security;data mining;feature selection;trees (mathematics)","DDoS attacks;REPTree classifier;data mining technique;data preprocessing methods;distributed Denial of Service attack detection;feature selection methods;intrusion detection system;online services;tree based classifier","","0","","17","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of ITM systems largely depends on the confidentiality of their monitor locations. In this paper, we investigate localization attacks aiming to identify ITM monitor location and propose the formal model of such attacks using communication channel theory. We also develop novel techniques that significantly increases the accuracy, efficiency, and secrecy of ITM localization attacks. Specifically, we introduce (i) a frequency-based modulation technique to effectively reduce the interference from the background traffic and achieve a high attack accuracy, (ii) both time and space hopping techniques to randomize signal pattern and make the attack hard to detect by the defender, and (iii) Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) based techniques to increase the attack efficiency of identifying multiple monitors simultaneously. We derive closed formulae for the performance analysis of our proposed techniques and conduct extensive simulations. Our data validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that the adversary can identify ITM monitors accurately, efficiently, and secretly.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654820","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654820","","Accuracy;Frequency modulation;Internet;MIMO;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","Internet;MIMO communication;invasive software;modulation;telecommunication traffic","ITM localization attack secrecy;ITM monitor location;ITM systems;Internet threat monitoring;MIMO based techniques;background traffic;communication channel theory;effective localization attacks;frequency-based modulation technique;interference;malware propagation;multiple input multiple output;randomize signal pattern;space hopping techniques;time hopping techniques","","0","","13","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The more we invent for the good of humanity, humans try to negate the good factor and hence the fear of viruses and hacking. Research has to move in the direction of preserving and guarding network environments which today are facing an ever increasing number of security threats in the form of Trojan worm attacks and viruses that can damage the Computer systems and communication channel. Firewalls are used as a security check point in a network environment; nevertheless there are still various types of security issues which are on the rise. In order to strengthen the network from illegal access the concept of IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is gaining popularity around the world. The applications of the data mining in the computer security field improves the development of IDS in order to work on these applications it is essential to classify the degree of attacks in IDS and use it through data mining. Despite the use of IDS we cannot be completely certain about its workability and results of IDS use have been uncertain. To plug the loopholes we need to adjust the detection strategy according to the degree of attack activities to ensure error free results.","","","978-1-84919-868-4","10.1049/cp.2013.2486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6851533","Data Mining;Firewall;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Threat","","computer viruses;data mining;firewalls;telecommunication channels","IDS;Trojan worm attacks;communication channel;computer security field;computer systems;data mining;firewalls;guarding network environments;illegal access;intrusion detection system;network security;preserving network environments;security threats;viruses","","0","","","","","27-28 Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Thus, security requirements should be always considered in design phase. Modern approaches in manufacturing and automation technology such as: DPWS and OPC UA tend to integrate control system networks to the computer networks by the aid of service-oriented architecture technology. Single Sign-On is a property of access control in information security which focuses on authentication mechanism. It can be performed across federated domains and provides a single entry point for the user that can login only once and become capable of accessing to disparate protected resources in different locations. The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) can be used invisibly in background of system and apply as the standard for providing Single Sign-On mechanism by exchanging identity information to different security domains regardless of the specific authentication protocol which is used for identities in that domain. This paper proposes the model for performing of Single Sign-On approach for protected devices and applications that support web services technology and locate across different boundaries of the hierarchy model of control and automation.","2157-0981","978-1-4673-2316-1","","10.1109/ICTKE.2012.6408563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408563","authentication;hierarchy model of control and automation;identity federation;saml;security token;single sign-on;soap;web services security","Authentication;Automation;Protocols;Simple object access protocol;Standards","Web services;XML;authorisation;cryptographic protocols;industrial plants;manufacturing data processing","IT system;SAML;Web services;access control;authentication mechanism;authentication protocol;computer network;control system;factory floor;federated domain;information security;information technology;security assertion markup language;security enhancement;service-oriented architecture technology;single sign-on approach","","0","","18","","","21-23 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some methods have been presented to resolve this problem. These methods have different strengths. However, they also have different limitations. In order to build complicated attack processes accurately, this paper uses cluster and correlation techniques to construct high-level attack scenarios. Fuzzy cluster algorithm based on the similarity of attack attributes is proposed to classify alerts generated by IDSs. And then in every alert class, alert correlation method based on prerequisites and consequences of attacks is used to construct attack scenarios. Finally, to get whole attack graphs, this paper hypothesizes and reasons about attacks possibly missed based on the equality constrain and casual relation between intrusion alerts. The experimental results on LLS DDOS2.0 prove that the method is useful and effective.","","978-0-7695-3381-0","","10.1109/CW.2008.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4741338","Attack Scenario;Cluster;Correlation;similarity","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Computer science;Correlation;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Statistics","correlation methods;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","LLS DDOS2.0;cluster techniques;correlation techniques;equality constrain;fuzzy cluster algorithm;high-level attack scenarios;intrusion detection systems;low-level intrusion alerts","","1","","18","","","22-24 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
