IEEE International Conference on","20071127","2007","","","295","300","We study the deployment and configuration of the next generation of network traffic filters within a quantitative framework. Graph-theoretic and optimization methods are utilized to find optimal network traffic filtering strategies that achieve various security or cost objectives subject to hardware or security level constraints. We rely on graph-theoretic concepts such as centrality measures to assess the importance of individual routers within the network, given a traffic pattern. In addition, we consider several possible objectives involving financial costs associated with traffic filtering, the cost of failing to filter traffic, a utility associated with filtering traffic, and combinations of these costs and this utility. These optimization problems are solved taking into account constraints on network-wide filtering capabilities, individual filter capabilities, and also lower and upper bounds on the effective sampling rate for source-destination pairs. Centralized but dynamic solutions of the resulting problems are obtained under varying network traffic flows. The resulting optimal filtering strategies are simulated in MATLAB using real traffic data obtained from the Abilene project. Simulations comparing these strategies with some heuristic approaches demonstrate that they are more effective in achieving network traffic filtering objectives.","","978-1-4244-0442-1","978-1-4244-0443-8","10.1109/CCA.2007.4389246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4389246","","Constraint optimization;Cost function;Filtering;Filters;Hardware;Next generation networking;Optimization methods;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Weight measurement","computer networks;graph theory;invasive software;optimisation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Abilene project;MATLAB;graph theory;malware filtering;network security;network traffic filters;optimization;weighted optimality measures","","1","","12","","","1-3 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike intrusions that seek to overtly disable or damage a system, it is particularly hard to detect because it uses a variety of low/slow vectors and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It is often assisted (intentionally or not) by an insider who might be an employee who downloads a trojan or uses a hardware component that has been tampered with or acquired from an unreliable source. Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans. We describe a framework to detect potential exfiltration events that actively monitors of a set of key parameters that cover the entire stack, from hardware to the application layer. An attack alert is generated only if several monitors detect suspicious activity within a short temporal window. The cross-layer monitoring and integration helps ensure accurate alerts with fewer false positives and makes designing a successful attack more difficult.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2013.6642487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642487","","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Monitoring;Resource description framework;Sensors;Universal Serial Bus","invasive software","advanced persistent threats;application layer;attack alert;confidential data;cross-layer integration;cross-layer monitoring;data exfiltration;test based detection approaches;trojan;unauthorized leakage","","0","","28","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second International Workshop on","20051024","2005","","","52","61","Since the widespread adoption of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking during the late '90s, P2P applications have multiplied. Their diffusion and adoption are witnessed by the fact that P2P traffic accounts for a significant fraction of Internet traffic. Further, there are concerns regarding the use of these applications, for instance when they are employed to share copyright protected material. Hence, in many situations there would be many reasons to detect P2P traffic. In the late '90s, P2P traffic was easily recognizable since P2P protocols used application-specific TCP or UDP port numbers. However, P2P applications were quickly empowered with the ability to use arbitrary ports in an attempt to go undetected. Nowadays, P2P applications explicitly try to camouflage the originated traffic in an attempt to go undetected. Despite the presence of rules to detect P2P traffic, no methodology exists to extract them from applications without the use of reverse engineering. In this paper we develop a methodology to detect P2P traffic. It is based on the analysis of the protocol used by a P2P application, extraction of specific patterns unique to the protocol, coding of such a pattern in rules to be fed to an intrusion detection system (IDS), and validation of the pattern via network traffic monitoring with SNORT (an open source IDS) fed with the devised rules. In particular, we present a characterization of P2P traffic originated by the OpenNap and WPN protocols (implemented in the WinMx application) and FastTrack protocol (used by KaZaA) obtained using our methodology, that shows the viability of our proposal. Finally, we conclude the paper exposing our undergoing efforts in the extension of the methodology to exploit differences between centralized and decentralized P2P protocols, as well as the characterization of encrypted traffic, and highlight a new research direction in the identification of P2P traffic.","","0-7695-2417-6","","10.1109/HOT-P2P.2005.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517791","","Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Protection;Protocols;Reverse engineering;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;copyright;pattern recognition;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FastTrack protocol;Internet traffic;KaZaA;OpenNap protocol;P2P application;P2P file-sharing traffic detection;P2P protocols;P2P traffic;SNORT;TCP;UDP;WPN protocol;copyright protected material;encrypted traffic characterization;intrusion detection system;network traffic monitoring;pattern extraction;peer-to-peer networking;reverse engineering","","12","1","23","","","21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DSC can detect zero-day scanning worms with a high detection rate and very low false positive rate. (2) We demonstrate the effectiveness of early worm warning based on local victim information. For example, warning occurs with 0.19% infection of all vulnerable hosts on Internet when using a /12 monitored network.

It is a one-class SVM based approach, trained with abstracted user audit logs data from 1999 DARPA.","","0-7803-8131-9","","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260106","","Computer errors;Computer security;Cybernetics;Data security;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines;system monitoring","DARPA;Internet;SVM;anomaly detection;computer system security;information system security;intrusion detection;pattern analysis;support vector machines;system audit log files","","6","","10","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additional hardware required for implementation of our framework has very low power and area overheads which makes it possible to practically implement execution monitoring even on embedded processors. Our technique achieves an order of magnitude lower power overhead compared to other similar techniques.

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming. We show how to make fast and correct classification decisions under these constraints and apply them to real benchmark data.

After comparing various design options, we adapted from hash table data structure, employing the special hardware unit assist to calculate a hash over our unique ascending order quadruple which worked in a quite simple but efficient way that is totally different from the Snort scheme, our design not only differentiates both directions of a TCP connection and thus eliminates unwanted additional search operation, but also avoids data corruption and greatly reduces the probability of hash collisions. In order to improve the allocation/deallocation procedure for TCP connection nodes in our IDS systems, we further devised a large management stack caching with a local memory buffer, which is fully exploiting the specialized network processor architectures and optimizing the use of various types of memories with different speeds and size.

In the proposed method, the IDS has additional knowledge about common multimedia file formats and uses this knowledge to perform a more detailed analysis of packets carrying that type of data. If the structure and selected contents of the data are compliant, the corresponding stream is tagged accordingly, and the IDS is spared from further work on that stream. Otherwise, an anomaly is detected and reported.

Past research has shown that the Hidden Marcov Chain, Genetic Algorithm, and the two-second time windows are among the best features selection methods for SDC Model. However this paper aims to improve the accuracy model by applying the features extraction based customized features. The customized features are the network data set which has been preprocessed through the following steps: removing biased attributes, discretized using chi-merge and remove the attributes with string value. The previous research applies the feature extraction based on all features. The best model is measured based on the detection rate, false alarm rate and number of rules using four data mining techniques such as Ripper(Jrip), Ridor, PART and decision three. The experiment is conducted using three random KDD-cup99 data sets. The result shows that the features extraction based on customized features has increased the accuracy model between 0.4% to 9% detection rates and reduced between 0.17% to 0.5% false alarm rates.

However, those efforts concentrated on preventive techniques constituting a first line of defense (like cryptography and authentication), which are effective in inhibiting the diverse malicious attacks. Relatively, little attention has been paid for employing a second line of defense that can detect intrusive behavior after successfully penetrating the first one. The latter line of defense is known as the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). While mature in wired and many types of wireless networks, IDSs are envisaged to have more opportunities in WSNs.

Unfortunately, a significant number of them are purchased by world-wide networks of ticket purchasing robots run by scalpers looking to turn a quick profit. Ticket outlets currently employ CAPTCHAs to slow down fully automated purchasing robots. Since the profit associated with scalping tickets is several orders of magnitude larger than the cost associated with paying humans to solve the CAPTCHAs, this approach has been ineffective. CAPTCHAs have a fundamental flaw when used to protect online tickets: the cost to solve them using humans is fixed and small. To address this problem, this paper explores a novel alternative based on geographically-driven proof-of-work. The crux of the approach exploits the observation that most legitimate clients are located geographically close to the event. By requiring every client to solve a cryptographic puzzle whose difficulty is based on their distance to the event, ticket purchasing robots must be placed close to each event in order to monopolize the tickets. This requirement significantly increases the cost of operating such networks. Using emulation and simulation, we demonstrate the utility of our approach in tackling the online ticketing problem.","","978-1-4244-6739-6","978-1-4244-6739-6","10.1109/INFCOMW.2010.5466663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466663","","Communications Society;Costs;Cryptography;Databases;Emulation;Humans;Marketing and sales;Protection;Robotics and automation;Robots","Internet;marketing data processing;security of data","CAPTCHA;TicketMaster;cryptographic puzzle;geographic proof-of-work;online ticket protection;scalping tickets;ticket purchasing robots","","1","","23","","","15-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Storage-based intrusion detection system (SIDS) has become a valuable tool in monitoring for the intrusion. However, the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of storage technology, this paper presents a novel idea to design object-based intrusion detection architecture. In this paper, we study how intrusion can be detected at object level in the OBSS (object-based storage system) environment, and discuss how features of the OBSS can be used in intrusion detection. Through analysis, we find that the impact of intrusion detection on the OBSS is negligible. The advantage of this approach is simple.

Some formulas are derived to relate the network bit rate with the number of the processing units, their processing power, and memory size.

The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models.

The basis of the method is command interception and fast authentication from the cyber security point of view (reliable detection of cyber intrusions) and from the operational reliability point of view. To simplify the process, the command authentication is done at the relay level and relay controls. As such it does not depend on the communication architecture. The method is based on new developments on dynamic state estimation based protection and substation level distributed state estimation. This infrastructure provides the capability to monitor, intercept, and authenticate/block commands as they reach the relay and the control circuits of the relay. Since all controls are exercise through a relay, this approach provides 100% coverage. The authentication/blockage of commands is done quickly because of the distributed approach which enables quick assembly of a local real time model and fast analytics with this local model. Specifically, for each command the proper local real time model is constructed and quickly analyzed to determine the effects on the power system. The analytics determine the effect of the command, if executed, on the system and in particular on the operational reliability of the system. In case of a command that may have adverse effects on the operational reliability of the system, the command will be blocked and the operator will be alerted. In addition to the command authentication at the relay level, an open-source real-time network monitoring system for capturing and parsing network traffic is presented. Because the method is based on the substation level dynamic state estimator which uses only local substation level measurements and data, a byzantine type attack is not considered possible for the proposed approach. Finally, a discussion on the architecture required to integrate the network monitoring and state estimation sys- ems is presented. The methodology is presently being tested in a laboratory setup that includes a digital simulator of the electric power system and hardware in the loop.","1530-1605","","","10.1109/HICSS.2015.320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070135","Dynamic State Estimation;PMU;Protection","Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Real-time systems;Relays;State estimation;Substations","power engineering computing;power system management;power system reliability;public domain software;real-time systems;security of data;state estimation","command authentication;command interception;cyber intrusions;cyber security;dynamic state estimation;electric power system;fast authentication;hardware in the loop;open-source real-time network monitoring system;operational reliability;operational security;substation level distributed state estimation","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20070402","2006","","","1","8","The use of reconfigurable hardware for network security applications has recently made great strides as FPGA devices have provided larger and faster resources. Regular expressions have become a necessary and basic capability of intrusion detection systems, but their implementation tends to be expensive in terms of memory cost and time performance. This work provides an architecture that reduces the exponential NFA to DFA conversion cost to a linear growth for many expressions. By handling the timing and integration of the regular expression-based rules in a custom microcontroller, the memory costs are reduced and the capabilities are increased over a DFA-only solution.

Technol., Indian Inst. of Technol., Kharagpur","Communication Systems and Networks and Workshops, 2009. COMSNETS 2009. First International","20090331","2009","","","1","10","In recent years there has been an immense proliferation of wireless networks and they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Thus there is a serious need to secure such networks from attacks. Usually an attacker can penetrate into a network by utilizing a chain of exploits. An exploit is a small piece of code that makes use of vulnerabilities present in a service or in a system. Each exploit in the chain has a set of preconditions and effects and lays the groundwork for the subsequent exploits. Application of such a chain of exploits generates a set of attack states or network states which form a path called the attack path and combining many such attack paths produces an attack graph. A lot of research has been done on issues such as scalable and time efficient ways of generation of attack graphs in wired network in contrast to that in wireless scenario. Moreover, the need is to identify the path that may be chosen by the attacker to comprise a target system in less time and effort. The proposed methodology in this paper aims as finding out the optimal or risk-prone attack path that the attacker may choose to penetrate a wireless network. The generation of attack paths in a wireless network is itself a difficult proposition due to networks inherent dynamic nature and ever changing topology. In this work, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique has been employed for finding out the optimal attack path using an attack vector metric. The effort required on the part of the attacker to compromise a target system has been termed as an attack vector. The wireless nodes have been assigned severity measures obtained from customized risk parameters which serve as an input to the modified PSO technique. A case study has also been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.","","978-1-4244-2912-7","978-1-4244-2913-4","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808869","","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;IP networks;Information technology;National security;Network topology;Particle swarm optimization;Wide area networks;Wireless networks","particle swarm optimisation;radio networks;telecommunication security","attack graph;attack vector metric;chain-of-exploits;modified PSO;network security;optimal attack path;particle swarm optimization;wireless network","","1","","35","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.15th International Conference on","20070122","2006","","","5","10","This paper proposes an attack-resilient routing architecture, called cross-layer active re-routing (CARE), for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and ""dysfunctional"" network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.","1095-2055","1-4244-0572-6","","10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617","","Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing","attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures","","0","","12","","","9-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The efficiency of an Intrusion detection system in the case of an adhoc network is not only determined by its dynamicity in monitoring but also in its flexibility in utilizing the available power in each of its nodes. In this paper we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system, based on a power level metric for potential adhoc hosts, which is used to determine the duration for which a particular node can support a network-monitoring node. The detection of intrusions in the network is done with the help of Cellular Automata (CA). IDFADNWCA (Intrusion Detection for Adhoc Networks with Cellular Automata) focuses on the available power level in each of the nodes and determines the network monitors. Power Level Metric in the network results in maintaining power for network monitoring, with monitors changing often, since it is an iterative power optimal solution to identify nodes for distributed agent based intrusion detection. The advantage of this approach entails is the inherent flexibility it provides, by means of considering only fewer nodes for reestablishing network monitors.","","978-0-7695-3489-3","","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737122","Adhoc Networks;Cellular Automata;Genetic Algorithms","Computer networks;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network topology;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Power system protection;Watches;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cellular automata;monitoring;telecommunication security","IDFADNWCA algorithm;cellular automata;distributed agent based intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;iterative power optimal solution;network-monitoring node;power level metric;wireless adhoc network","","0","","10","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we begin by presenting a Generic Cloud-based Intrusion Detection Architecture (GCIDA) and we then propose a cloud-based solution to improve the false alarm reduction and reduce the workload using Cloud as a Service (CaaS).

Unlike other statistical anomaly detection methods such as nearest neighbor approach, K-means clustering or probabilistic analysis that employ distance computation in the feature space to identify the outliers, our approach does not involve costly point-to-point computation in organizing the data into clusters. Another advantage is the reduced network size. We use the classification capability of the K-Map on selected dimensions of data set in detecting anomalies. Randomly selected subsets that contain both attacks and normal records from the KDD Cup 1999 benchmark data are used to train the hierarchical net. We use a confidence measure to label the clusters. Then we use the test set from the same KDD Cup 1999 benchmark to test the hierarchical net. We show that a hierarchical K-Map in which each layer operates on a small subset of the feature space is superior to a single-layer K-Map operating on the whole feature space in detecting a variety of attacks in terms of detection rate as well as false positive rate.","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.843274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408059","Computer network security;neural network applications;self-organizing feature maps","Benchmark testing;Computational efficiency;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Computer vision;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Nearest neighbor searches;Organizing","probability;security of data;self-organising feature maps","computer network security;hierarchical Kohonenen Net;intrusion detection system;multilevel hierarchical K-Map;neural network application;probabilistic analysis;self-organizing feature maps","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Computer Simulation;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated","56","3","27","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces.

The coding scheme and genetic operations including selection, crossover, and mutation are discussed in detail. The IGA's local searching ability is improved by combining it with discrete gradient method. The results obtained by several tests are quite encouraging, including that the immune operator contributes much to solve the problem of premature convergence.

As control systems become increasingly complex, the number of inputs and outputs increase. Therefore, in order to maintain sufficient levels of state-awareness, a robust system state monitoring must be implemented that correctly identifies system behavior even when one or more sensors are faulty. Furthermore, as intelligent cyber adversaries become more capable, incorrect values may be fed to the operators. To address these needs, this paper proposes a fuzzyneural data fusion engine (FN-DFE) for resilient state-awareness of control systems. The designed FN-DFE is composed of a three-layered system consisting of: 1) traditional threshold based alarms; 2) anomalous behavior detector using self-organizing fuzzy logic system; and 3) artificial neural network-based system modeling and prediction. The improved control system stateawareness is achieved via fusing input data from multiple sources and combining them into robust anomaly indicators. In addition, the neural network-based signal predictions are used to augment the resiliency of the system and provide coherent state-awareness despite temporary unavailability of sensory data. The proposed system was integrated and tested with a model of the Idaho National Laboratory's hybrid energy system facility known as HYTEST. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed FNDFE provides timely plant performance monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities. It was shown that the system is capable of identifying intrusive behavior significantly earlier than conventional threshold-based alarm systems.","2168-2267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2323891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823672","Artificial neural networks;data fusion;fuzzy logic systems;resilient control systems;state-awareness","Artificial neural networks;Control systems;Monitoring;Robustness;Sensor systems;Vectors","control engineering computing;fuzzy neural nets;power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;sensor fusion","FN-DFE engine;HYTEST facility;Idaho National Laboratory;anomalous behavior detector;artificial neural network-based system;control system state-awareness;control systems;critical infrastructure;energy production system;enhanced resilient state-awareness;fuzzy-neural data fusion engine;hybrid energy systems;industrial system;intelligent cyber adversaries;neural network-based signal predictions;self-organizing fuzzy logic system;system modeling;system prediction;system state monitoring;threshold based alarms;threshold-based alarm systems","","3","","41","","2014-05-30","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We consider agents which may perform different independent tasks, but cooperate to guarantee the entire system's safety. Agents plan their next actions by following a set of rules which is shared among them. Such rules are decentralized, i.e. they dictate actions that depend only on configurations of neighboring agents. Some agents may not be acting according to this cooperation protocol, due to tampering or spontaneous failure. To detect such misbehaviors we propose a solution where each agent runs a local monitor using only locally available information.

With respect to a cognitive motivated situation like a conversation between partners, mind-maps become interesting as they are able to process stimulating signals whenever they occur.

Hence, these networks demand much stronger security mechanisms than the traditional networks. It is hard to achieve security and robustness in the routing protocols at the same time in such networks. Several issues have to be understood and addressed before devising a security mechanism. This paper targets securing the reactive routing protocol AODV. The routing protocol is vulnerable to two kinds of attack: external and internal attack. We have discussed some existing external attacks and possible malicious behavior from compromised nodes. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a dual level security model. On the first level, we have the external attack detection model (EADM), that secures the network with authentication and confidentiality that rely on mutual trust between nodes. And on the second level, the intrusion detection model (IDM) identifies the misbehaving nodes using the knowledge base and the response model (RM) isolates these nodes from the network.","","0-7803-7625-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179629","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Environmental management;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Network topology;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;data privacy;military communication;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;EADM;IDM;ad hoc networks;authentication;compromised nodes;confidentiality;dual level security model;external attack;external attack detection model;internal attack;intrusion detection model;knowledge base;malicious behavior;military communication;mutual trust;reactive routing protocol;response model;robustness;scalable security schemes","","1","","17","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network topology authentication, and hybrid key cryptography are the building blocks for this proposal: the former means that a cryptographic key can be generated if and only if the current network topology is compliant to the ldquoplanned network topologyrdquo, which acts as the authenticated reference; the latter means that the proposed scheme is a combination of features from symmetric (for the ciphering and authentication model) and asymmetric cryptography (for the key generation model). The proposal fits the security requirement of a cryptographic scheme for WSN in a limited computing resource. A deep quantitative security analysis has been carried out.

The IDS analyses the update phenomena of each of the motes in the network and computes an Intrusion Warning Score (IWS) that indicates a possible intrusion due to an illegitimate software update.","","","","10.1109/ICARA.2015.7081151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081151","","Protocols;Robot sensing systems;Security;Software;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;robot programming;security of data;software maintenance;system monitoring;wireless sensor networks","IDS;IWS;OTA update protocols;WSN assisted environments;WSN collaboration;WSN environments;WSN sink;WSN software update protocol;WSN software updates monitoring;illegitimate software update;intrusion detection system;intrusion warning score;mote running software;over the air update protocols;robots;wireless sensor network","","0","","33","","","17-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the techniques of buffer overflow vulnerability detection are limited to manual analysis, binary-patch comparison, fuzzing and so on. They rely on manual analysis, thus cause high overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel method of detection of buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which is based on fuzzing, data-flow dynamic analysis and automated exception analysis. This new method effectively improves the detection of unknown security vulnerabilities (0 Day).

Cloud Computing systems can be easily threatened by various cyber attacks, because most of Cloud Computing systems provide services to so many people who are not proven to be trustworthy. Therefore, a Cloud Computing system needs to contain some Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSs) for protecting each Virtual Machine(VM) against threats. In this case, there exists a tradeoff between the security level of the IDS and the system performance. If the IDS provide stronger security service using more rules or patterns, then it needs much more computing resources in proportion to the strength of security. So the amount of resources allocating for customers decreases. Another problem in Cloud Computing is that, huge amount of logs makes system administrators hard to analyse them. In this paper, we propose a method that enables Cloud Computing system to achieve both effectiveness of using the system resource and strength of the security service without trade-off between them.","1738-9445","978-1-4244-8830-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5745874","Cloud Computing;Cooperative IDS;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Multilevel IDS","","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","cloud computing;cyber attacks;log management;multilevel intrusion detection system;virtual machine","","8","1","8","","","13-16 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the Wired Equivalency Privacy (WEP) security protocol was broken, the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol has been considered the secure alternative compatible with hardware developed for WEP. However, in November 2008, researchers developed an attack on WPA, allowing forgery of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets. Subsequent enhancements have enabled ARP poisoning, cryptosystem denial of service, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Open source systems and methods (OSSM) have long been used to secure networks against such attacks. This article reviews OSSMs and the results of experimental attacks on WPA. These experiments re-created current attacks in a laboratory setting, recording both wired and wireless traffic. The article discusses methods of intrusion detection and prevention in the context of cyberphysical protection of critical Internet infrastructure. The basis for this research is a specialized (and undoubtedly incomplete) taxonomy of Wi-Fi attacks and their adaptations to existing countermeasures and protocol revisions. Ultimately, this article aims to provide a clearer picture of how and why wireless protection protocols and encryption must achieve a more scientific basis for detecting and preventing such attacks.","1540-7993","","","10.1109/MSP.2012.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193090","IEEE 802.11;Internet-based attacks on privacy and confidentiality;Wi-Fi protected access;attack experimentation;computer security;critical Internet infrastructure;intrusion detection and prevention","Communication system security;Encryption;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Network security;Phase shift keying;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","","","","3","","","","2012-05-01","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A class of IDSs is based on clustering of network traffic into normal and abnormal according to some features of the connections. The selected distance function to measure the similarity and dissimilarity of sessions' features affect the performance of clustering based IDSs. The most popular distance metric, which is used in designing these IDSs is the Euclidean distance function. In this paper, we argue that more appropriate distance functions can be deployed for IDSs. We propose a method of learning an appropriate distance function according to a set of supervision information. This metric is derived by solving a semi-definite optimization problem, which attempts to decrease the distance between the similar, and increases the distances between the dissimilar feature vectors. The evaluation of this scheme over Kyoto2006+ dataset shows that the new distance metric, can improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) clustering based IDS in terms of normal detection and false positive rates.","","978-1-4799-8817-4","","10.1109/AISP.2015.7123497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7123497","Anomaly detection;Clustering Algorithms;Intrusion detection system;Metric learning","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Feature extraction;Measurement;Support vector machines;Training data","mathematical programming;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Euclidean distance function;Kyoto2006+ dataset;SVM clustering;SVM-clustering based intrusion detection system;clustering based IDS;dissimilar feature vector;distance metric;false positive rate;network security;network traffic;normal detection;semidefinite optimization problem;support vector machine clustering","","0","","14","","","3-5 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attribute independence issue associated with Naïve Bayes has been resolved through the development of the Average One Dependence Estimator (AODE) algorithm.

In this paper, a component based method is proposed to analyze UDP traffic. Since flows in each component share the same application, P2P traffic can be identified without packet level information.","","978-1-4799-3649-6","","10.1109/ICICIP.2014.7010349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7010349","","IP networks;Internet;Peer-to-peer computing;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Punching;Servers","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Internet traffic;NAT traversal;Netflow based P2P detection;TCP;UDP traffic;component based method","","0","","23","","","18-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a distributed personal intrusion detection system (IDS) that provides local anomaly detection as well as centralized traffic analysis. The system first builds profiles for normal network activity and then labels as suspicious any events that deviate from the normal profiles. The normal profiles are based on variations in connection-based behavior at each individual host. Deviations at each host are recorded using a local weight assignment scheme and then further processed by the central analyzer to build a weighted link graph representing the overall network abnormality.
