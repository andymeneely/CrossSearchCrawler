Ordinary intrusion detection systems usually deal with network or OS attacks and could not detect database specific attacks. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find temporal patterns and rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels using a hybrid approach, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5358-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2014.7000815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000815","data mining;database security;inter-transaction rules;intrusion detection;specification;state machine","Data mining;Database systems;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Training","","","","0","","12","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we use two cost models. The first cost model assumes that all network intrusion detection devices have the same cost. The second model assumes that the cost of the device is relative to the traffic load on the network node on which it is installed. We evaluate two algorithms for finding the most prominent group in these cost models. The first algorithm is based on greedy choice of vertices and the second is based on heuristic search and finds the optimal deployment locations. We investigate combinations of heuristic functions based on solution cost and on solution utility and different node ordering strategies. We show that intelligent choice of the heuristic functions and node ordering can speed up the search. Empirical evaluation shows that while in the first cost model the greedy algorithm produces results that are negligibly close to optimal in the second cost model the difference between optimal and suboptimal solutions can be significant.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502182","","Communications Society;Cost function;Greedy algorithms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;search problems","DNIDS deployment utility;DNIPS;cost benefit deployment;cost model;group betweenness centrality;heuristic search;high-speed network;large-scale network;network intrusion detection devices;real time distributed network intrusion detection systems","","0","","27","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intrusion tolerance techniques focus on providing minimal level of services, even when the system has been partially compromised. This paper presents an intrusion tolerant approach for Denial of Service attacks to Web Services. It focuses on the detection of attack symptoms as well as the diagnosis of intrusion effects in order to perform a proper reaction only if the attack succeeds. In particular, this work focuses on a specific Denial of Service attack, called Deeply-Nested XML.

IEEE","20070723","2007","","","1","8","In the power industry, the focus has been almost exclusively on implementing equipment that can keep the power system reliable. Until recently, communications and information flows have been considered of peripheral importance. However, increasingly the information infrastructure that supports the monitoring and control of the power system has come to be critical to the reliability of the power system. Communication protocols are one of the most critical parts of power system operations, responsible for retrieving information from field equipment and, vice versa, for sending control commands. Despite their key function, to-date these communication protocols have rarely incorporated any security measures, including security against inadvertent errors, power system equipment malfunctions, communications equipment failures, or deliberate sabotage. Since these protocols were very specialized, ""security by obscurity"" has been the primary approach. However, security by obscurity is no longer a valid concept. In particular, the electricity market is pressuring market participants to gain any edge they can. A tiny amount of information can turn a losing bid into a winning bid - or withholding that information from your competitor can make their winning bid into a losing bid. And the desire to disrupt power system operations can stem from careless mistakes, to simple teenager bravado, to competitive game-playing in the electrical marketplace, and even to actual terrorism. As the power industry relies increasingly on information to operate the power system, two infrastructures must now be managed: not only the power system infrastructure, but also the information infrastructure. The management of the power system infrastructure has become reliant on the information infrastructure as automation continues to replace manual operations, as market forces demand more accurate and timely information, and as the power system equipment ages. Therefore, the reliability of the power sys- - tem is increasingly affected by any problems that the information infrastructure might suffer. This paper focuses on IEC TC57 WG15 security standards work which is addressing the reliability and security of the information infrastructure.","1932-5517","1-4244-1296-X","1-4244-1298-6","10.1109/PES.2007.386013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275779","DNP;ICCP;IEC;IEC 60870-5;IEC 61850;Security;communications;information infrastructure;power system operations;reliability","Communication system security;Energy management;Information security;Power system control;Power system management;Power system measurements;Power system reliability;Power system security;Power systems;Protocols","power markets;power system control;power system economics;power system management;power system reliability;power system security","IEC TC57 WG15 security standards;communication protocols;electricity market;information infrastructure security;power industry;power system control;power system equipment malfunctions;power system management;power system monitoring;power system reliability;reliability enhancement","","18","","","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With recent advances in the performance and viability of using GPUs for various highly-parallelised data processing tasks, a number of security challenges are raised. Unscrupulous software running subsequently on the same GPU, either by the same user, or another user, in a multi-user system, may be able to gain access to the contents of the GPU memory. This contains data from previous program executions. In certain use-cases, where the GPU is used to offload intensive parallel processing such as pattern matching for an intrusion detection system, financial systems, or cryptographic algorithms, it may be possible for the GPU memory to contain privileged data, which would ordinarily be inaccessible to an unprivileged application running on the host computer. With GPUs potentially yielding access to confidential information, existing research in the field is built upon, to investigate the practicality of extracting data from global, shared and texture memory, and retrieving this data for further analysis. These techniques are also implemented on various GPUs using three different Nvidia CUDA versions. A novel methodology for digital forensic examination of GPU memory for remanent data is then proposed, along with some suggestions and considerations towards countermeasures and anti-forensic techniques.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140493","","Digital forensics;Graphics processing units;Memory management;Random access memory;Remanence","digital forensics;graphics processing units;memory architecture;parallel architectures;pattern matching","CUDA graphics processing units;GPU memory;Nvidia CUDA GPU;antiforensic techniques;confidential information access;cryptographic algorithms;data remanence;data retrieval;digital forensic;financial systems;global-shared texture memory;highly-parallelised data processing tasks;host computer;intrusion detection system;memory attacks;multiuser system;offload intensive parallel processing;pattern matching;privileged data;program executions;unprivileged application","","0","","24","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel defense architecture that blocks malicious traffic far from the protected servers is proposed. Protected servers are hidden inside a secure overlay network only accessible through a set of access-nodes (AN) with rate limiting and access control functionalities. Protected servers are required to provide at least one dummy public server as an initial connection step point. An experimental prototype is implemented and tested. Results show; system compatibility with e-commerce websites needs, also, the AN impact on the protected server performance is less than 10% reduction in file transfer throughput, in addition, the public server could survive attack rates more than 10 times higher than an ordinary server. Through discussion we demonstrate the system ability to protect the servers' resources from all attack types without sacrificing data integrity or confidentiality.

Ideally, protection of the program from illegal usage would be considered at each stage of this program's life cycle. The proposition put forward here is to augment intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and employ them as a tool to support secure software development. Many state-based intrusion detection methods share structural and behavioural similarities with the set of processes known as discrete-event systems (DESs). A common structure for modelling DESs is the deterministic finite-state automaton. There exist several compatible anomaly detection techniques which construct finite- state machine models of normal behaviour through the decomposition of associated data (e.g., system calls, HTTP requests) into sequences of events. This paper proposes the application of decentralized DES theory to formally analyze and enhance these approaches to anomaly detection with misuse prevention. Models of misuse attacks are generated in the same manner as the legal usage representation, then augmented and integrated into the program model to prevent the execution of malicious sequences. The technique described herein simultaneously uses anomaly and misuse approaches to prevent and disable attacks before their completion.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529478","Software security;anomaly detection;discrete-event systems;finite-state automata","Automata;Discrete event systems;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Programming;Security;Software maintenance;Software testing","discrete event systems;finite state machines;security of data;software engineering","discrete-event systems;intrusion detection systems;legal usage representation;secure software development;software deterministic finite-state automaton","","0","","17","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Integrated Anomaly Detection for Cyber Security of the Substations","Junho Hong; Chen-Ching Liu; Govindarasu, M.","Sch. of Electr. Eng. & Comput. Sci., Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA, USA","Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on","20140618","2014","5","4","1643","1653","Cyber intrusions to substations of a power grid are a source of vulnerability since most substations are unmanned and with limited protection of the physical security. In the worst case, simultaneous intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single substation or multiple substations of a power grid.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2294473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786500","Anomaly detection;GOOSE anomaly detection;SMV anomaly detection and intrusion detection;cyber security of substations","Circuit breakers;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Power grids;Substation automation","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;power system reliability;substation automation","ADS;GOOSE;IED;SMV;catastrophic power outages;circuit breakers;cyber intrusions;generic object oriented substation event;host-based anomaly detection systems;integrated anomaly detection system;intelligent electronic devices;malicious behaviors;multicast messages;network-based anomaly detection systems;physical security;power grid;sampled measured value;severe cascading events;simultaneous anomaly detection;simultaneous intrusion detection method;substation automation testbed;substation facilities;substations;temporal anomalies;user-interfaces","","1","","37","","2014-04-10","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, existing protocols which provide full anonymity of source node, destination node and routes are vulnerable to malicious activités. The anonymous protocols hide the identity of the malicious node and enhance the possibility of Black Hole Attack. In order to provide anonymity without compromising the security, we have extended Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing Protocol(ALERT) to make it secure. The secure version is named as Secure Anonymous Location Based Efficient Routing protocol (S-ALERT). S-ALERT uses Suspect Detection algorithm to choose the nodes in a route which provide unperceivable route. If there is existence of a Black Hole it actually sends a false RREP packet and advertises itself as the shortest route found. The proposed scheme avoid the black hole problem, and also prevent the network from further malicious behavior. Through simulation results it has been shown that proposed method can effectively detect and provide protection from black hole attack. S-ALERT routing efficiency is also better than existing protocols.","","978-1-4799-6499-4","","10.1109/ICIINFS.2014.7036496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036496","Black hole attack;MANET;anonymity;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention","Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","MANET;S-ALERT;black hole attack problem;data traffic;destination node;false RREP packet;military operations;mobile ad hoc network;secure anonymous location-based efficient routing protocol;source node;suspect detection algorithm","","0","","11","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network noise is one of the most challenging issues for efficient threat detection and classification. In this study, normal and noisy datasets for network IDS domain are used and various classification algorithms are evaluated. The results show that an evaluation of algorithms without noise is misleading for IDSs since algorithms that perform best without noise do not necessarily achieve the same in a realistic noisy environment.

Most works focus on profile/model definition while critical issues related to anomaly measuring, aggregating and thresholding have not received similar attention. In this paper, we in particular address the issue of anomaly scoring and aggregating which is a recurring problem in multi-model anomaly-based approaches. We propose a two stage aggregation/thresholding scheme particularly suitable for multi-model anomaly-based approaches. The basic idea of our scheme is the fact that anomalous behaviors induce either intramodel anomalies or inter-model ones. Our scheme is designed for real-time detection of both intra-model and inter-model anomalies. More precisely, we propose local thresholding in order to detect intra-model anomalies and use a Bayesian network in order to, on one hand, extract inter-model regularities and serve, on the other hand, as an aggregating function for computing the overall anomaly score associated with each analyzed audit event. Our experimental studies, carried out on recent and real <i>http</i> traffic, show for instance that most Web-based attacks induce only intra-model anomalies and can be effectively detected in real-time. Moreover, this scheme significantly improves the detection rate of Web-based attacks involving inter-model anomalies.","","978-1-4244-2412-2","978-1-4244-2413-9","10.1109/LCN.2008.4664304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664304","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Computer science;Event detection;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Telecommunication traffic","Web sites;security of data","aggregating function;anomaly score aggregation;multi-model anomaly-based approaches;two-stage aggregation/thresholding scheme","","0","","23","","","14-17 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect malicious and selfish nodes in a network. The intrusion detection techniques used for wired networks may no longer be effective and sufficient when adapted directly to a wireless ad-hoc network, thus existing methods of intrusion detection have to be modified and new methods have to be defined in order to work effectively and efficiency in this new network architecture.

These shared resources, easy accessibility and shared storage of resources are responsible for putting the confidential information under a great deal of risk. Although the cloud is becoming gigantic day by day but its efficiency is being hampered considerably due to the threats in the cloud computing environment. The threats in the cloud computing environment not only account to external attacks which are launched with the intention of hampering work flow of the cloud provider but the internal attacks also which are being launched so that the efficiency and the reliability of the cloud is at stake. The firewalls monitor traffic between networks such that all the traffic must flow through it, but they are certainly not sufficient to shield the dynamic cloud computing environment from all attacks. They may be able to subvert external attacks to a certain extent but internal attacks do not even pass through the firewalls, therefore rendering them useless. Moreover, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the virtual machines in order to set up large scale attacks like Ddos. They compromise these VM's into zombies and the detection of these VM's is very difficult because cloud users install all types of applications onto their VM's some of which may be malicious. Thus, the cloud needs stronger security for handling all the intrusions of every scale. An intrusion detection system is presented in the paper which detects the intrusions launched on the VM's which act an avenue for deploying large scale attacks, therefore, minimising the loss. The IDS presented in the paper is a network IDS and provides security from the IaaS based attacks.","","978-1-4799-6928-9","","10.1109/CICN.2014.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065580","ARP;CSP;DNS;Ddos;IDS;VM","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;firewalls;security of data;virtual machines","cloud computing;confidential information;data loss;firewalls;intrusion detection;virtual machines;virtual networks","","0","","22","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes a lightweight method to identify DoS attacks by analyzing host behaviors. Our method is based on the concept of BLINd Classification or BLINC: no access to packet payload, no knowledge of port numbers, and no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. Rather than using pre-defined signatures or rules as in typical Intrusion Detection Systems, BLINC maps flows into graphlets of each attack pattern. In this work we create three types of graphlets for the following DoS attack patterns: SYN flood, ICMP flood, and host scan.

It must also allow for a matching algorithm with predictable and low complexity, in order to ensure robustness against denial-of-service attacks. Unfortunately, these requirements often conflict. We show, for instance, that a single rule, when coupled with a backtracking matching algorithm, can bring the processing rate down to nearly ONE packet per second. Performance vulnerabilities of this type are known for patterns described using regular expressions, and can be avoided by using a deterministic matching algorithm. Increasingly, however, rules are being written using the more powerful regex syntax, which includes non-regular features such as back-references. The matching algorithm for general regex's is based on backtracking, and is thus vulnerable to attacks. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic algorithm for the full regex syntax, which builds upon the deterministic algorithm for regular expressions. We provide a (rough) complexity bound on the worst-case performance, and show that this bound can be tightened through compile-time analysis of the regex structure. These bounds can be used as an admissibility check, to isolate expressions that require further analysis. Finally, we present an implementation of these algorithms in the context of the Snort IDS, and experimental results on several packet traces which show substantial improvement over the backtracking algorithm.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462149","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Protection;Robustness","backtracking;computational complexity;deterministic algorithms;pattern matching;security of data","Snort IDS;backtracking matching algorithm;compile-time analysis;denial-of-service attacks;deterministic matching algorithm;fast pattern matching;intrusion detection systems;processing rate;regex syntax;robust pattern matching;robustness;rule language","","4","1","36","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike many existing solutions, TUF does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes an approach that is fundamentally more general. TUF is a cross-layer technique that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to attacks at the network layer. Because most routing disruption attacks cause a significant drop in end-to-end goodput, monitoring the goodput of a route at the transport layer can detect abnormalities in the network (e.g., node or link failures, DoS attacks, etc.). Once an abnormal event is detected, a route rebuilding process is initiated at the network layer to find a new route. Using analysis and simulation results, we show that the TUF architecture is effective in thwarting a wide range of attacks, including protocol-compliant (also known as ""JellyFish"") attacks.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","1-4244-0357-X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150899","","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer security;Cryptography;Information security;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Snow;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;TUF architecture;cross-layer technique;goodput monitoring;mobile ad hoc networks;network layer;protocol-compliant attacks;route rebuilding process;routing disruption denial-of-service attacks;secure routing architecture;throughput-feedback routing;transport layer","","2","","20","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Promoters enable an on-demand amplification of reactions to a particular cause. This allows to react quickly with appropriate countermeasures. On the other hand, inhibitors are capable of regulating this uncontrolled amplification by suppressing the reaction. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of these mechanisms in a network security scenario consisting of network monitoring elements, attack detection, and firewall devices. Previous work identified most existing detection approaches as not suitable for high-speed networks. This problem can be alleviated by separating the methodologies for network monitoring and for subsequent data analysis. In this paper, we present an adaptation algorithm that allows to manage the individual configuration parameters in order to optimize the overall system. We show the advantages of self-regulating techniques based on promoters and inhibitors that lead to maximized security and that gracefully degradate in case of overload situations.

In this paper, we present an innovative packet classification algorithm, called partial paralleled algorithm based on plus bits (P3). P3 algorithm begins by two paralleled single-field engines and followed by hash table of the remained 3 fields. A novel structure, plus bits, is introduced to reduce hash memory accesses. For a 4k filterset, P3 algorithm can achieve about 9 memory accesses on average, taking 326 KB of memory for its data structure and supporting incremental update.

In this paper, we address the knowledge gap by investigating the possible inclusion of a statistical based time series modeling that can be seamlessly integrated into existing cyber defense system. Cyber-attack processes exhibit long range dependence and in order to investigate such properties a new class of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average (GARMA) can be used. In this paper, GARMA (1,2; δ,1) model is fitted to cyber-attack data sets. Three different estimation methods are used to estimate the parameters. The Hannan-Rissanen Algorithm, Whittle Estimation Method and Maximum Likelihood Estimation methods are used to estimate the parameters of the GARMA (1,2;δ,1). Point forecasts to predict the attack rate possibly hours ahead of time also has been done and the performance of the models and estimation methods are discussed. The investigation of the case-study will confirm that by exploiting the statistical properties, it is possible to predict cyber-attacks (at least in terms of attack rate) with good accuracy. This kind of forecasting capability would provide sufficient early-warning time for defenders to adjust their defense configurations or resource allocations.","","978-1-4799-7625-6","","10.1109/NSITNSW.2015.7176399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176399","Communication Systems;Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average;Intrusion forecasting;Long range dependence;Predictive modeling","Autoregressive processes;Computational modeling;Forecasting;Hidden Markov models;Maximum likelihood estimation;Predictive models","autoregressive moving average processes;maximum likelihood estimation;resource allocation;security of data;time series","ARMA models;GARMA models;Hannan-Rissanen algorithm;Whittle estimation method;communication systems;cyber defense system;cyber-attack processes;generalized autoregressive moving average;intrusion detection systems;maximum likelihood estimation methods;parameter estimation;predictive modeling;resource allocation;time series modeling","","0","","17","","","17-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A study of visualization techniques as applied to one particularly demanding area, information assurance, leads to the conclusion that there is a proper and formal way to approach designing visualization techniques for maintaining situational awareness in complex domains. Visualization techniques should be specifically designed or selected to align with one of the three identified stages of situational awareness - perception, comprehension, or projection -and with one of five standard uses of visualization - monitoring, inspecting, exploring, forecasting, or communicating. Greater value can be realized by selecting the right visualization technique to focus on each operational task, rather than searching for a single all-encompassing solution to fit every need.

As the SIP is gaining popularity, open architecture of VoIP often makes SIP vulnerable to so many threats. The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads. Moreover the associated signatures database can also be incorporated into other VoIP protocols and open source IDSs like SNORT. This paper has provided the effective mechanism in creating well-formed defense against malicious SIP message attacks to ensure the integrity and security of VoIP subsystems.","","","","10.1109/SKIMA.2014.7083519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083519","Intrusion detection system;Malicious message;SIP;SQL injection;VoIP","Inspection;Internet;Protocols;Security;Servers;Standards;Syntactics","Internet telephony;client-server systems;computer network security;digital signatures;public domain software;signalling protocols;virtual machines","BackTrack7;IDS;Kphone;SER;SIP clients;SIP server;SIP-based infrastructure security;SIPSAK;SNORT;Session Initiation Protocol;VMware;VoIP communication;VoIP subsystem integrity;VoIP subsystem security;Voice over Internet Protocol communication;Windows 7;X-lite;attack signature generation technique;attack-signature generation framework;attacking tool;configuration file;detection rule improvement;intrusion detection system;logical error identification;malformed SIP message identification;malicious SIP message attacks;malicious SIP messages;malicious message attacks;malicious message identification;open architecture;open source IDS;open source SIP server;processing overheads;regular expression;security mechanisms;signaling protocol;signature database;testbed architecture;threat vulnerability;virtual environment","","0","","8","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Non-parametric feature generation for RF-fingerprinting on ZigBee devices","Patel, H.","US Air Force Res. Lab., Rome, NY, USA","Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA), 2015 IEEE Symposium on","20150820","2015","","","1","5","As the Internet of Things becomes a reality, proliferation of wireless devices such as ZigBee nodes has accelerated. Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.<sup>1</sup>","","978-1-4673-7556-6","","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208645","","Authentication;Linear regression;Performance evaluation;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Internet of Things;Zigbee;ad hoc networks","Internet of Things;RF-fingerprinting;ZigBee ad-hoc networks;ZigBee devices;nonparametric classifier random forest;nonparametric feature generation","","0","","22","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We illustrate a new algorithm to detect workflow shifts, where human action streams statistically deviate from an observed pattern of usage. One can infer semantics from workflow periods, the intervals between workflow shifts, and identify these shifts as a possible indicator of group actions. For its evaluation, a prototype of APSAT monitors file access from a series of scripted workflow simulations.

Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction. This action is hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS.

Each μFirewall is built with a packet filter and DTE-enhanced evaluator to provide dual fine-grain protection at the individual host level. A distributed intrusion detection and response (DIDR) system provides a fast response to both external and internal attacks, and allows an adaptive change in the security policy in the protected network.

Modern ID techniques must cope with increasingly sophisticated attacks as well as rapidly rising network line speeds. Signature based ID is forced to sample sparsely, increasing the likelihood of malicious traffic entering the network without scrutiny. Con sequently, flow-based ID is gaining attention as an effective complement. ID systems are furthermore often characterized as either network-based or host-based. The autonomous multi agent design paradigm is a scalable, attractive alternative for its potential to leverage the strengths of both architectures: the broad perspective and visibility into distributed malicious activity provided by network-based ID, and the comprehensive view of the local node provided by host-based ID. This paper therefore develops an architecture for a new multi agent, flow-based intrusion detection sysem. The architecture is designed in two iterations of increasing complexity. These innovative ID designs use a ""repuation"" system to permit agents to dynamically find nodes that are most effective for classifying malicious network activity. Furthermore, each system design includes the development of an innovative classifier that uses multi objective evolutionary algorithms to aid in the search for effective operational parameter values. Evaluation using an extensive agent simulation framework highlights the conditions under which the reputation system provides a significant classification benefit.","Pending","978-1-4244-7834-7","","10.1109/CEC.2011.5949798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949798","","Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Object oriented modeling;Pattern recognition;Peer to peer computing","computer network security;multi-agent systems;telecommunication traffic","autonomous multiagent design;computer network protection;flow-based ID;flow-based intrusion detection;malicious network activity classification;malicious traffic;network attack classification;signature-based ID","","1","2","17","","","5-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks. This paper proposes a secure wake up scheme that activates a sensor node by a secure wake up radio from a sleep state only if messages from an authenticated and legitimate node are pending. A lightweight security verification scheme is used that can easily be performed without requiring the node to change to active state.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211020","security;wake-up radio;wireless sensor network","Batteries;Communication standards;Communication switching;Cryptography;Protection;Security;Sleep;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4;battery powered sensor node;energy saving sleep state;frame cryptographic protection;lightweight security verification scheme;personal area networks;secure wake up scheme;sleep deprivation attack;wireless sensor network","","5","","16","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we design a spectrum scanning protocol that incorporates knowledge about the scanning effectiveness across different bands, which can increase scanning efficiency. The adversary, however, can also exploit such knowledge to its advantage. To understand the interplay underlying this problem, we formulate a Bayesian model, where the IDS faces a scanning allocation dilemma: if the intruder has no knowledge, then all the bands are under equal threat, while if the intruder has complete knowledge, then less-protected bands are more likely to be threatened. We solve this dilemma and show the optimal IDS strategy switches between the optimal response to these threats. Finally, we show that the strategy might be sensitive to prior knowledge, which can be corrected by adapted learning.","","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178269","Bayesian game;Spectrum scanning;intrusion detection system","Bandwidth;Bayes methods;Games;Interference;Intrusion detection;Signal to noise ratio;Switches","Bayes methods;access protocols;radio spectrum management;security of data","Bayesian model;dynamic spectrum access scenarios;equal threat;intrusion detection system;less-protected bands;malicious activity spectrum;malicious user detection;scanner capability;scanning allocation dilemma;scanning effectiveness;spectrum scanning protocol","","0","","20","","","19-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops. If the nodes in the ad-hoc network change their positions dynamically, it is called a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected. To maintain data integrity and for prevention of black / gray hole attack hash function is used.","","978-1-4799-6895-4","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014732","AODV;Black hole;Cooperative Black hole;MANET;gray hole","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;AODV protocol;MANET;ad hoc on demand distance vector;black hole attack prevention;black-gray hole attack hash function;dynamic topology;geographical position;hash function;malevolent node;mobile ad hoc networks;physical security;wireless connectivity;wireless network","","0","","13","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks.

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity.

To deal with these drawbacks, we present an enhanced hierarchical key management scheme using a stable and power efficient cluster management technique. Each cluster head retains the public key of its member nodes only and act as a router when dealing with nodes of other cluster members. Using this technique, the overhead on centralized server is reduced. Moreover, the need of each node storing all public keys are diminished thus minimizing the storage overhead on each node.

To aim at the shortcomings of the classic association rule (Apriori algorithm), some improvements are carried out on it and the improved method is applied into network security situation awareness. Through the data mining method, the association rules can be found for the reflection of large-scale network security situation. By the influence of the attack to the sequence of entropy, the association rules are divided into normal and abnormal space in order to do the clustering. In accordance with the clustering, the level of network security awareness can be obtained.","","978-1-4244-5142-5","978-1-4244-5143-2","10.1109/ITAPP.2010.5566194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5566194","","Association rules;Computational modeling;Entropy;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Stability analysis","computer network security;data mining","Apriori algorithm;association rule;computer network application;data mining method;network security situation awareness","","0","","10","","","20-22 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among these are the protection of host against malicious agents and protecting agents against hosts that execute agents. Especially of interest is the use of mobile agents in e-commerce settings, in which users release autonomous agents to roam around virtual stores and find desired products. In this research we investigated several schemes for dealing with assuring mapplets secure computation in a possible hostile environment without the need of special firewall or intrusion detection safe hardware. In this investigation we focus on realistic schemes which are feasible to implement. The presented mobile computing scheme do not require that the foreign host to be totally trustworthy that provides the same assurance as if the computation was carried using a traditional secure client/server model. The presented dynamical scheme is based on distribution of the algorithm on different hosts and making use of that the transactions has shared secrets by using the (k, n) secret-sharing threshold scheme. One of the positive outcomes of the current scheme is that it is distributed denial of service resistant system. The current proposed scheme presents a novel study of the tradeoff between the security and communication in remote computation. This formal study allows us to take the first step toward understanding the problem, indicating the significance of the various cryptographic assumptions, and as a result of the development of improved remote mobile computation schemes.","1810-7869","0-7803-8193-9","","10.1109/ICNSC.2004.1297447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297447","","Autonomous agents;Communication system security;Computer crime;Distributed computing;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protection","distributed programming;electronic commerce;mobile agents;mobile computing;security of data;telecommunication security","autonomous agents;cryptography;distributed remote environment;e-commerce;host protecting agents;intrusion detection safe hardware;malicious agents;mapplets secure computation;mobile agent computing;remote mobile computation;secret sharing threshold method;secure client-server model;secure mobile code computing;service resistant system","","1","","18","","","21-23 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system can be used for military and first responder training providing the nexus for decision making through the use of computational models, advanced technology, situational awareness and command and control. During a training session, data is streamed back to a central repository allowing commanders to evaluate their squads in a live action setting and assess their effectiveness in an after-action review. In order to effectively analyze this data, an interactive visualization system has been designed in which commanders can track personnel movement, view surveillance feeds, listen to radio traffic, and fast-forward/rewind event sequences. This system provides both 2-D and 3-D views of the environment while showing previously traveled paths, responder orientation and activity level.

However, it also brings new challenges for security and access control, especially in IaaS clouds. The introduction of virtualization layer increases new security risks which should be restricted and confined by more stringent access control techniques. In this paper, we propose a hybrid access control framework, named iHAC, which combines the advantages of both Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Type Enforcement (TE) model to enable unified access control and authorization for IaaS clouds. A permission transition model is provided to dynamically assign permission to virtual machines. A VMM-based access control mechanism is designed to confine the VM's behaviors in a fine-grained manner. Ihac is implemented and evaluated in iVIC platform. The experimental results show that our proposed framework is effective and efficient.","","","","10.1109/UCC.2014.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027606","IaaS cloud;hybrid access control;virtual machine","Authorization;Cloud computing;Virtual machining;Virtualization","authorisation;cloud computing;virtual machines","IaaS clouds;Internet;RBAC;VMM;authorization;cloud computing;hybrid access control framework;iHAC;permission transition model;resource sharing;role-based access control;security risk;type enforcement model;virtual machine;virtualization layer","","0","","19","","","8-11 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the sensitive and confidential nature of the data involved, entities have to employ various anonymization techniques to meet legal requirements in compliance with confidentiality policies. Nevertheless, the very composition of network trace data makes it a challenge when applying anonymization techniques. On the other hand, basic application of microdata anonymization techniques on network traces is problematic and does not deliver the necessary data usability. Therefore, as a contribution, we point out some of the ongoing challenges in the network trace anonymization. We then suggest usability-aware anonymization heuristics by employing microdata privacy techniques while giving consideration to usability of the anonymized data. Our preliminary results show that with trade-offs, it might be possible to generate anonymized network traces with enhanced usability, on a case-by-case basis using micro-data anonymization techniques.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237310","Differential Privacy;Generalization;K-anonymity;Network Trace Anonymization;Usability","Cryptography;Data privacy;Databases;IP networks;Noise;Privacy;Usability","data privacy","anonymized network traces;collaborative research;confidentiality policies;data usability;microdata anonymization;microdata privacy;network trace data publication;network trace data sharing;usability-aware anonymization heuristics;usability-aware network trace anonymization","","0","","39","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing signature-based intrusion detection mechanisms are often not sufficient in detecting many types of attacks. K-means is a popular anomaly intrusion detection method to classify unlabeled data into different categories. However, it suffers from the local convergence and high false alarms. In this paper, two soft computing techniques, fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence, are used to solve these problems. We proposed SFK-means approach which inherits the advantages of K-means, Fuzzy K-means and Swarm K- means, simultaneously we improve the deficiencies. The most advantages of our SFK-means algorithm are solving the local convergence problem in Fuzzy K- means and the sharp boundary problem in Swarm K- means.

"Using parallel distributed reasoning for monitoring computing networks","Musman, S.","MITRE Corp., McLean, VA, USA","MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, 2010 - MILCOM 2010","20110106","2010","","","417","422","We describe a distributed reasoning system called Otto-Mate that is used to detect, reason about, and respond to incidents on a computing network. Events for monitoring computing networks occur at different system levels. Some information might relate to data, some might be operating system specific, some application or service related, some could be network related, and from each there will be compound events that describe incident effects and information about the situation context. All together there can be thousands of events per second. Today's approaches to monitoring networks are typically centralized, sending events over the network to a single engine for analysis. Centralized monitoring ultimately cannot scale to address the volume of events that one would ideally like to be able to monitor, so techniques of today often make severe compromises relating to the events that they ingest. Centralized monitoring creates a single point of failure and also generates significant network load. To overcome these deficiencies we have developed a more distributed, approach: our reasoner agents can (in theory) be installed on every monitored resources and the reasoner language (used for programming the reasoners) enables knowledge in a reasoner's working memory to be synchronized over multiple reasoners enabling them to implement parallel distributed reasoning algorithms that are able detect event patterns irrespective of whether the events are local or remote. Distributing the reasoning makes the system extremely resilient. Additionally, since the knowledge shared between the reasoning agents represents summary information, and because many on-line event correlation algorithms often suppress reporting once an incident has been reported, the amount of network load needed to support the distributed monitoring can actually be reduced. To demonstrate our approach we describe its application to the monitoring of a computing network that has been instrumented to protect it - - against 0-day email virus attacks.","2155-7578","978-1-4244-8178-1","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680347","autonomic response;distributed reasoning;event correlation;intelligent agents;network and security monitoring;parallel programs","Cognition;Correlation;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Sensors;Servers;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;computer viruses;electronic mail;inference mechanisms;parallel processing","Otto-Mate;computing networks;email virus attacks;operating system;parallel distributed reasoning algorithms;parallel distributed reasoning system;reasoner language;reasoning agents","","0","","11","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider a similar problem in the setting of dense multihop wireless network. In particular, we assume a large number of nodes with multihop routes using the shortest path routing, so that the routes can be modelled as straight line segments. Furthermore, we assume that we are able to measure the number of transmissions occurring in the different parts of the network during the measurement periods. In this setting we study the problem of inferring the end-to-end traffic demands (traffic matrix) based on the available information. As this information is not sufficient we make some additional Poissonian assumptions on the nature of the traffic in order to have a well-defined problem with a unique solution. Analysing the problem in the framework of stochastic geometry, we are able to give an exact solution for the formulated traffic matrix estimation problem.
