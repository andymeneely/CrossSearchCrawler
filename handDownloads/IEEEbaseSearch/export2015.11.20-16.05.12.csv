Together, this often exceeds the capabilities of purely software-based network security systems. As an alternative, hardware acceleration has been employed, e.g., for performing deep-packet inspection and pattern matching as well as general packet-header processing. While such implementations, capable of handling lower protocol layers, have been extensively studied in research and industry, their extension to higher communication layers has only rarely been addressed. Such capabilities, including the application level (OSI Layer 7), are the focus of this work. We present the NetStage platform, employing reconfigurable computing for high-throughput low-latency network processing, as well as associated development tools that allow networking domain experts to easily customize the system. As a use-case, we consider the realization of high-performance attack-resilient honeypots based on NetStage. To this end, we introduce the Malacoda language, its programming tools, and the generated target microarchitecture. We then evaluate the performance of Malacoda-generated vulnerability emulation handlers running on the NetStage platform.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902760","10G;FPGA;Network security;deep packet inspection;network stack","Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Routing;Security","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","Malacoda-generated vulnerability emulation handlers;NetStage platform;attack patterns;computer network security;computer system security;deep-packet inspection;hardware honeypot;high-level network applications;high-throughput low-latency network processing;packet-header processing;pattern matching;traffic volume","","0","","69","","2014-09-18","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Signature based network intrusion detection systems use a set of signatures S to evaluate captured network traffic for detecting intrusions. However, due to dynamic changes in the threat level of a network, only a subset of signatures s of S is relevant to the network at any given instance. Hence, we introduce a component called a dynamic threat profiler that periodically learns the changing nature of threats in a network. We model and prove the efficacy of the threat-aware signature based intrusion detection approach for obtaining network-specific useful alarms. We also present our architecture and discuss its internal functions. Finally, we present our experiments based on various threat scenarios and the results obtained, which show that network-specific useful alarms formed 95 percent of the alarms that were generated using our model, when compared with the traditional signature-based detection engine where useful alarms form only 30 percent of the generated alarms.","","978-0-7695-3189-2","978-0-7695-3189-2","10.1109/ICIMP.2008.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561330","","Cities and towns;IP networks;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Protocols;Search engines;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","mobile computing;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dynamic threat profiler;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network-specific useful alarms;signature based detection engine;threat-aware signature","","1","","14","","","June 29 2008-July 5 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The DOD Architecture Framework (DODAF) prescribes a modeling framework to capture high-level system design and operational requirements. The system attributes from a DODAF-compliant architecture can directly load a network simulator (Hamilton 2006). The use of network simulation to study denial of service attacks is well known. However, modeling and simulation techniques can be used to evaluate intrusion detection systems, place and configure security appliances and to design appropriate access control mechanisms.

Android is one of the most widely used mobile OS these days and that is the reason why it is the best practice to develop application on Android platform. The application for disseminating location based weather forecast is a client-server application on Android platform. It provides weather forecast information as per user's location or location of interest. While developing a client-server application, the communication between client and database server becomes imperative. This paper discusses detailed analysis for choosing appropriate type of web service, data exchange protocols, data exchange format, and Mobile positioning technologies for client-server application.

The detection analysis which we perform is based on features extraction from network packets dumps and it employs a behavioral and statistical analysis of communications' progress in time and packet index domain. There were performed experiments in four scenarios simulating traffic shaping, traffic policing and transmission on unreliable network channel to make properties of direct attacks and obfuscated attacks as various as possible.

Extant solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely mainly on prior explicit knowledge of specific worm signatures. As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets. Our results indicate that using this approach resulted in exceeding 90% mean accuracy, and for specific unknown worms accuracy reached above 99%, using just 20 features while maintaining a low level of false positive rate.","","1-4244-0705-2","","10.1109/CIDM.2007.368873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221297","","Computational intelligence;Computer worms;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Delay;File systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Operating systems;Software packages","data mining;invasive software","World Wide Web;background application activity;computer behavior;computer configurations;computer measurements;computer worm detection;data mining;feature selection","","1","","31","","","March 1 2007-April 5 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We evaluated our system using anonymised traffic captured on an operator's network, and the results showed an improvement of 31% of malicious servers detected resulting from the collaboration, and this without significant performance impact and bandwidth overhead (respectively 4% and 11kb/s).","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679994","Bloom filters;Botnet detection;Collaborative detection;Domain-flux botnets;Inter-domain detection","Collaboration;Communities;Monitoring;Privacy;Probes;Servers;Vectors","computer network security;data privacy;groupware;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","anonymised information exchange;anonymised traffic;business preservation;centralized approach;collaborative approach;collaborative detection system;interdomain botnet detection system;large-scale network real time analysis;malicious server identification;privacy preservation","","0","","27","","","20-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show how different attacks are reflected in different logs and argue that some attacks are not evident when a single log is analyzed. We present experimental results using anomaly detection for the virus Yaha.

Network functions virtualization together with software-defined networking can be used to efficiently coordinate different network security functionality in the network. To squeeze the best out of network capabilities, there is need for algorithms for optimal placement of the security functionality in the cloud infrastructure. However, due to the large number of flows to be considered and complexity of interactions in these networks, the classical placement algorithms are not scalable. To address this issue, we elaborate an optimization framework, namely OCDO, that provides adequate and scalable network security provisioning and deployment in the cloud. Our approach is based on an innovative multistage approach that combines together decomposition and segmentation techniques to the problem of security functions placement while coping with the complexity and the scalability of such an optimization problem. We present the results of multiple scenarios to assess the efficiency and the adequacy of our framework.

Most current network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) employ either misuse detection or anomaly detection. However, misuse detection cannot detect unknown intrusions, and anomaly detection usually has high false positive rate. To overcome the limitations of both techniques, we incorporate both anomaly and misuse detection into the NIDS. In this paper, we present our framework of the hybrid system. The system combines the misuse detection and anomaly detection components in which the random forests algorithm is applied. We discuss the advantages of the framework and also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset.

This paper focuses on a hybrid approach for intrusion detection system (IDS) based on data mining techniques. The main research method is clustering analysis with the aim to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. Most of the previously proposed methods suffer from the drawback of k-means method with low detection rate and high false alarm rate. This paper presents a hybrid data mining approach encompassing feature selection, filtering, clustering, divide and merge and clustering ensemble. A method for calculating the number of the cluster centroid and choosing the appropriate initial cluster centroid is proposed in this paper.

However, these approaches intrinsically suffer from the high overhead to communicate with their external devices. Consequently, they either significantly lose performance, or inevitably make invasive modifications to the processor inside. Our solution also rely on external hardware for DIFT, but unlike theirs, ours exploits the core debug interface (CDI) to tackle the communication issue. CDI is provided in most commercial processors for debugging so that we were able to build our system simply by plugging our hardware to the processor via CDI, precluding the need for altering the processor itself.

Also existing intrusion detection approaches have some limitations, namely impossibility to process a large number of audit data for realtime operation, low detection and recognition accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we apply modular neural network models to detect and recognize attacks in computer networks. They are based on the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) neural networks and multilayer perceptrons (MLP). PCA networks are employed for important data extraction and to reduce high dimensional data vectors. We present two PCA neural networks for feature extraction: linear PCA (LPCA) and nonlinear PCA (NPCA). MLP is employed to detect and recognize attacks using feature-extracted data instead of original data. The proposed approaches are tested with the help of KDD-99 dataset.

Firstly, we must improve the accuracy by using learning algorithms to classify the normal operations from the abnormal ones such algorithms include tf-idf, association rules, k-means clustering, and decision tree. Secondly, we may adapt for less accuracy in order to gain speed for both with and/or without parallel processing techniques. We also construct an adaptive learning algorithm to update the model.

So it is a key mission to make sure that the pattern definition is correct, complete and up to date. In this paper, a classical data mining algorithm is used to help us discover attack patterns, construct and maintain rules. It can overcome the highly dependent on knowledge of experts, time-consuming and error-prone drawbacks in previous approaches using manual analysis. Unfortunately, for a dynamic network environment where novel attack strategies appear continuously, the method shows a limited capability to detect the novel attack patterns.

The behavior based monitoring is used to avoid the polymorphic malicious code. Signature based detection system or fixing these vulnerabilities are not the efficient method. Thus the behavior based monitoring is used to avoid malicious code in window system. Some of them hook high level system APIs to detect the suspicious behavior of the code. Thus this cannot detect malicious code that directly invokes the native APIs. Thus a security scheme is used, that hooks native APIs in the kernel mode. It provides authentication of the system service caller in the kernel mode. So it prevents the malicious code calling native API directly. To provide extra authentication the dispatch ID is scrambled. For the scrambling to take place first the dispatch ID is distinguished as local ID and remote ID and then the filter is used to find the legitimate user. Next the scrambling is done with that legitimate user ID. The unscrambling is done to get the original dispatch ID only if it is a legitimate user. It introduces an average eight percent computation overhead into the system.","","978-1-4673-2756-5","","10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450586","Malicious code;Native API;Scrambling","Browsers;Computers;Educational institutions;Kernel;Monitoring;Registers","application program interfaces;security of data","behavior based monitoring;high level system API;kernel mode;local ID;malicious code prevention;polymorphic malicious code;remote ID;security scheme;signature based detection system;system service caller;window system","","0","","11","","","21-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our scheme borrows from small worlds, utilizes the concept of contacts, and use traffic pattern matching (TPM) and traffic volume matching (TVM) techniques. We also propose multi-directional search, in-network processing and query suppression to reduce communication overhead in energy-constrained MANETs and increase traceback robustness against spoofing and collusion.

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination. The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-99) dataset is used as a benchmark to compare this method with other existing techniques.

Routing protocol in MANET operates on the basic assumption that nodes are fully cooperative. Because of open infrastructure and limited battery power some nodes may not cooperate correctly. These nodes start refusing to forward data packets or drop them thereby degrades the performance of network. So it is very essential to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to prevent MANET from attacks. The IDS Watchdog, fails to detect node misbehavior in the presence of ambiguous collisions, receiver collisions, limited transmission power, false misbehavior, collusion and partial dropping. An intrusion detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) has been developed which consists of three parts, namely, ACK, Secure ACK (S-ACK), and Misbehavior Report Authentication (MRA). All the acknowledgement packets are digitally signed and verified to prevent forged acknowledgement packets. For signing and verifying the acknowledgement packets, keys are generated and distributed in advance. The proposed system uses One-hop ACK which is used to improve misbehavior detection rates. Basic drawback of S-ACK includes it cannot distinguish exactly which particular node is misbehaving node. Sometime well behaving nodes became a part of misbehaving link. Thus lot of well behaved node may be avoided by network which results in losing of well behaved routes. To eliminate the requirement of predistributed keys proposed system considers Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm.","","978-1-4799-2321-2","","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892733","Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm;EAACK;IDS;MANET","Classification algorithms;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Random access memory;Routing","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm;EAACK;IDS Watchdog;MANET;MRA;S-ACK;acknowledgement packets;ambiguous collisions;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;misbehavior report authentication;mobile ad hoc network;mobile nodes;node misbehavior detection;one-hop ACK;receiver collisions;routing protocol;secure ACK;wireless links","","1","","9","","","13-14 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detecting such potentially unknown sequences is the core problem in intrusion detection. In this paper, we focus on the problem of observing attacks over non-uniform, partially asynchronous event sets. We hence propose charactering attacks as partially ordered sets, and we show how these can be detected asynchronously, as will typically be the case in a modern computing architecture. By extending a naïve model incorporating subsets of known causal dependencies, enhanced observation strategies minimizing the number and cost of observations can be derived. This incorporation of knowledge regarding constraints on attack causality into observations allows for notable enhancements in the efficiency of detection. We also provide a simple example of an application of the model for the case of an intrusion detection system on a co-processor observing a host, although the model is intended for arbitrary non-uniform architectures and concurrent operations.","","978-1-4673-2160-0","","10.1109/ISSA.2012.6320435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6320435","Intrusion detection;asynchronous and partially asynchronous observation;causality models","Cryptography","security of data","arbitrary nonuniform architectures;attack causality;causal dependencies;charactering attacks;concurrent operations;coprocessor;intrusion detection system;malicious behavior;modern computing architecture;naïve model;nontrivial attack;partially asynchronous event sets;partially asynchronous observation;partially ordered sets","","0","","16","","","15-17 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Applying data mining and machine learning techniques to network intrusion detection often faces the problem of very large training dataset size. For example, the training dataset commonly used for the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project contained approximately five hundred thousand (10% sample of the original five million) observations, which were used to build intrusion detection classification models. The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack. A comparison of the actively trained neural network model with a C4.5 decision tree indicated that the actively learned model had better generalization accuracy.

A family of more promising methods detects RWAPs indirectly by identifying unauthorized wireless hosts through using temporal TCP/IP characteristics of SYN, FIN, and ACK local round trip times (LRTT). Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. In this work, we empirically analyzed extensive LRTT data and designed a light system - RAPiD with several algorithms for effective wireless hosts detection. Ultimately, SYN, FIN, and ACK LRTTs can be compared against each other to discover wireless hosts regardless of network speeds.

One is the rule-based that depends on the programmed rules to detect intrusions, and the other is the anomaly-based that depends on machine learning to detect intrusions. They have a complementary effect to avoid missing some attacks. The ultimate trait of our proposed framework is that it is flexible enough for users to do some changes and improvements. Users just need to take surprisingly little effort to customize the framework to fit for their needs.

Since Joshua Wright's KillerBee Framework was released with its focus on exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee networks, non security-hardened WSNs increase the risk of being vulnerable against certain attacks such as simple association flooding and packet replay attacks. We propose an anomaly-based approach intrusion detection system (IDS) optimized for ZigBee-based WSN to protect ZigBee-based WSN nodes against KillerBee supported attacks.

The goal is to recognize signatures of known attacks, match the observed behavior with those known signatures, and signal intrusion when there is a match.

Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification. The final decision is made on the integrated low-faceted character space.

However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme.

Recent developments in noncoherent synergistic radar (NCSR) allow the RF transmitter (sensor) and RF receiver (processing engine) to be deployed wirelessly up to three kilometers away from each other. A 'leaky cable' sensor (ported coax) provides a two-meter wide contour of detection, typically fifty to two hundred meters in length. A miniature antenna provides a two-meter, spherical point-of-detection. For the purpose of this paper, ""sensing elements"" include; nonmetallic baseball-sized artificial stones and tree branches, RF miniature antenna, battery circuit and logic. All of which priced to be ""left behind"". The processing engine includes a portable receiver connected to a tripod-mounted directional antenna, located in a safe-zone far away from its related sensing elements. The receiver multiplexes, facilitating the processing of up to sixteen different frequency-coded transmitters (artificial stones). An alarm, resulting from an intrusion into any one of the sixteen spherical point zones is reported to wireless hand-held equipment. Results of a series of tactical field trials are published. Sensors (artificial stone) were secretly deposited by hand, dropped from aircraft or simply distributed using military artillery.","","0-7803-7882-2","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297539","","Engines;Hardware;Hazards;Intrusion detection;Military aircraft;Personnel;Radar antennas;Radio frequency;Sensor systems;Transmitters","antennas;radar;radio receivers;radio transmitters;safety systems;security;sensors","RF miniature antenna;RF receiver;RF transmitter;frequency-coded transmitters;intrusion detection system sensor;law-enforcement personnel;leaky cable sensor;low-cost component;military artillery;noncoherent synergistic radar;nonmetallic baseball-sized artificial stones;portable sensor;processing engine;tripod-mounted directional antenna;wireless hand-held equipment","","0","","","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors. Moreover, unlike most IDSs, most of the thresholds in SAHN-IDS are set dynamically. We show the effectiveness of SAHN-IDS through simulations.","","0-7803-9311-2","","10.1109/TENCON.2005.300979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085224","","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Degradation;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;directive antennas;telecommunication security;wireless channels","anomaly detection;directional antennas;frequency channels;intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;suburban ad-hoc networks;transmission channel;transmission power","","1","","22","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This becomes ever important, since wireless heterogeneity will persist and nodes in military ad hoc networks are bound to move beyond rare-and-slow scenarios. The combination of wireless heterogeneity and mobility incurs lots of challenges in research and development, and the ultimate goal in our research is to provide transparent and seamless user experience in such environments without fixed or predictable infrastructure support.

When a node wishes to communicate with other node in the network, it invites all available nodes to participate in the routing mechanism; moreover, conventional routing protocols assume trusted co-operative environment. As a result, network layer of MANET is prone to various security attacks and therefore, finding a secure and efficient route becomes a major challenge.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","DPI;Deep packet inspection;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;NIDPS;network intrusion detection and prevention system;regular expressions","Automata;Complexity theory;Correlation;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Timing","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","FPGA chip;LaFA;RegEx detection systems;bit rate 34 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;lookahead finite automata;network intrusion detection;per-character-state processing;scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;single-commodity field programmable gate array;state transition detection;suboptimal character-based detection method","","4","","34","","2012-01-18","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By implementing multiple aircraft in an assessment configuration, aerial monitoring and diverse sensing can be accomplished through the use of ad-hoc networking principles; aircraft act as nodes, each being a distributed agent in the network. Combined with a method called the Distributed Apt Resource Transference System (DARTS) for reallocating redundant or alternately-allocatable resources, such implementations can enjoy longer operational duration, increased coverage, and a higher probability of executing the desired reconnaissance. DARTS employs a hybridization of gossip and flooding-based resource discovery methods to find suitable replacement resources in the case of a node failure. Failures may arise due to natural (environmental) interference or malicious attacks designed to disrupt the mission. Testing of the fault-tolerant resource management techniques demonstrated resiliency of the system, resulting in minimal bandwidth requirements to reallocate (up to 6-fold reduction in traffic) and a faster speed of resource reallocation (up to 79% improvement), even in the face of an inconsistent state of operation. By implementing intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies to spawn the reallocation process (a procedure called triggering), DARTS provides a flexible, lightweight, and scalable method to efficiently allow reconnaissance and other distributed sensing applications to occur on a mobile, airborne platform.","2155-7578","978-1-4244-8178-1","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5679552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679552","","Aircraft;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Sensors","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;security of data","ad hoc network;distributed agent;distributed apt resource transference system;distributed sensing method;fault tolerant distributed reconnaissance;flooding based resource discovery method;intrusion detection system;resource management;resource reallocation","","3","","16","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A core component of the smart grid is the advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs), which increase the attack surface due to smart devices deployed at households. Manual management of security incidents in such a large and complex system is impractical, and the need for automated response and recovery to attacks is critical. This paper addresses that challenge through two main contributions. First, we introduce and classify an extended set of AMI-specific cyber incident response actions. Second, we define a cost model and an approach to translate security properties into monetary costs. The cost model is a key element in enabling an automated response engine to make optimal decisions and mitigate cyber incidents.","","978-1-4673-0910-3","978-1-4673-0909-7","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486008","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486008","AMI;CPS;Cyber security;Response action","Availability;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Home appliances;Pricing;Security;Taxonomy","metering;power system management;power system security;smart power grids","AMI;AMI-specific cyber incident response actions;advanced metering infrastructures;automated response actions;cost modeling;monetary costs;security incident management;security property;security vulnerability;smart devices;smart grid","","4","","31","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical DDoS attack, a large number of compromised hosts are amassed to send useless packets to jam a victim, or its Internet connection, or both. In the last two years, it was discovered that DDoS attack methods and tools are becoming more sophisticated, effective, and also more difficult to trace to the real attackers. On the defense side, current technologies are still unable to withstand large-scale attacks. The main purpose of this article is therefore twofold. The first one is to describe various DDoS attack methods, and to present a systematic review and evaluation of the existing defense mechanisms. The second is to discuss a longer-term solution, dubbed the Internet-firewall approach, that attempts to intercept attack packets in the Internet core, well before reaching the victim.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2002.1039856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039856","","Companies;Computer crime;Cryptography;IP networks;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Security;Stability;Tutorial;Web and internet services","Internet;authorisation;packet switching;telecommunication security","DDoS attack methods;DDoS attack tools;Internet firewall;Internet stability;attack packets interception;distributed attack detection;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attacks;large-scale attacks;reflector attacks;tutorial","","114","8","15","","","Oct 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We suggest an enhancement to make the 3-way handshake in SCTF stateless and call it Fast-SCTF. We then propose a framework using BGP for a single-packet handshake.

Wireless sensor networks have been used in military applications, environmental monitoring applications, healthcare applications, and even home applications. An adversary may want to disrupt these sensor networks for various reasons. Adversaries range from a hacker with a laptop to corporations and governments who have a vested interest in compromising the proper operation of an unwelcome sensor network. Since sensor nodes are small and usually placed in uncontrolled environments, they are susceptible to capture and reprogramming by an adversary. The low-power nature of sensor nodes make traditional strong encryption approaches to network security infeasible as nodes have limited processing power and sometimes significant energy constraints. This paper presents work in progress on developing a system which would protect a wireless sensor network from denial-of-service attacks after one or more nodes on the network have been captured and reprogrammed by an adversary. This system removes the need to rely on tamper proof packaging to protect the cryptographic keys and other sensitive data which is stored on nodes. With the proposed system, even if cryptographic keys are obtained by an attacker and are used to send false routing information or other spurious control information, the network will be able to identify such malicious nodes by using artificial intelligence and an expert system developed using the C Language Integrated Production System tool.","1091-0050","978-1-4799-0052-7","","10.1109/SECON.2013.6567421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567421","","Computer crime;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks","C language;artificial intelligence;cryptography;expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","C language integrated production system tool;CLIPS expert system tool;artificial intelligence;autonomous sensor nodes;base station;cryptographic key protection;data collection;denial-of-service attacks;energy constraints;environmental monitoring applications;false routing information;healthcare applications;home applications;limited processing power;malicious nodes;military applications;sensitive data protection;spurious control information;strong encryption approaches;tamper proof packaging;unwelcome sensor network;wireless sensor network security","","1","","20","","","4-7 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Backend database being the main target for external attacks such as SQL Injection Attacks, there is an emerging need to handle such attacks to secure stored information. Pre-deployment testing alone does not ensure complete security and hence post-deployment monitoring of web applications during its interaction with the external world can help us to handle SQL Injection Attacks in a better way. In this paper, we present a framework which can be used to handle tautology based SQL Injection Attacks using post-deployment monitoring technique. Our framework uses two pre-deployment testing techniques i.e. basis path and data flow testing techniques to identify legal execution paths of the software. Runtime monitors are then developed and integrated to observe the behavior of the software for identified execution paths such that their violation will help to detect and prevent tautology based SQL Injection Attacks.","","978-1-4673-1425-1","","10.1109/CyberSec.2012.6246104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246104","Data Flow Testing;Path Testing;Post-deployment Monitoring;Runtime Monitors;SQL Injection Attacks (SQLIAs);Tautology","Databases;Games;Monitoring;Runtime;Security;Software;Testing","Internet;SQL;data flow analysis;data integrity;safety-critical software","Web application availability;backend database;basis path techniques;data confidentiality;data flow testing technique;data integrity;legal execution path;post-deployment monitoring technique;predeployment testing technique;runtime monitors;stored information security;tautology based SQL injection attacks","","2","","21","","","26-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Association rules are a common method in data mining. But, it causes the sharp boundary problem. The concept of fuzzy set is better than partition method because fuzzy sets provide a smooth transition between members and non-members of a set, consequently handle the sharp boundary problem in an appropriate way.

The evaluations showed that the Bayesian Network classifier is a suitable model which resulted in same performance level for classifying the Denial of Service (DoS) attacks with Association Rule Mining while as well as Genetic Algorithm, the Bayesian Network classifier performed better in classifying probe and User to Root (U2R) attacks and classified DoS equally. The result of the classification showed that Bayesian network classifier is a classification model that thrives well in network security.

Nodes in the network are fully dependent on other nodes so as to complete the communication successfully. In addition to this, nodes are moving freely and make dynamic topology. Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Though traditional cryptographic methods are there they are pre-determined, hence assumption is not always practical in dynamic network. To facilitate such issue trust is a prominent factor to defend against security issues in MANET. Our aim in this review is to present schemes which are mainly focused on trust based security for MANET and also discuss the needs and properties of trust and discuss the attacks that mainly affect the security and also discussed the traditional proposed security solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICICA.2014.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965058","Authentication;MANET;Security;Trust","Authentication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad hoc networks;trust based security schemes","","0","","35","","","6-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of multiple techniques is the subject of research for deriving security requirements. In this paper, we are overlapping misuse case and attack trees techniques to propose a new technique named ""Hybrid Technique"". This Hybrid Technique merges the strengths of misuse cases and attack trees making the system stronger to mitigate weaknesses effectively in large and complex systems. In our approach we firstly identify threats using the concepts of threat modeling, and then map these threats into security requirements using Hybrid Technique.

In this paper we propose a dynamic anomaly detection approach for augmented flows. We sketch network state during flow creation enabling general purpose threat detection. We design and develop a support vector machine based adaptive anomaly detection and correlation mechanism capable of aggregating alerts without a-priori alert classification and evolving models online.
