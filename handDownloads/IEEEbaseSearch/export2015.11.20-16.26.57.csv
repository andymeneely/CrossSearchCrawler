"Security Incident Origin Discovery (SIOD): IP Transaction Tracking for Centralized Cyber Defense","Charbonneau, N.; Newman, B.; Pecelli, D.","MITRE Corp., Bedford, MA, USA","Military Communications Conference (MILCOM), 2014 IEEE","20141120","2014","","","30","39","In many enterprise Internet Protocol networks, Network Address Translation and other traffic forwarding techniques protect interior assets from exterior threats by minimizing exposure to just a single, hardened point. Complex networks may incorporate several layers of such protection. However, this obfuscation also hinders legitimate cyber security functions, discovering the complete path of a suspicious traffic flow requires inspecting forwarders' logs, unraveling one layer of concealment at a time. These challenges are compounded when centralized cyber-defense teams must pursue suspicious activity across numerous regional and individual site networks. Identifying a single host at the end of a dubious transaction may require coordination among central, regional, and local administrators, as well as human review of many intermediary devices' activity logs. In this paper, we describe an approach to automate the investigation process by correlating details of alerts and forwarder records to iteratively discover the chain of forwarders implicated in a given transaction. By rapidly revealing a suspicious transaction's true endpoints, incident response times can be dramatically reduced, allowing for rapid intervention and analysis. We present our prototype tracing algorithm in pseudo-code, describe the diverse lab environment in which it was developed, and detail specific trace scenarios for both web and Domain Name Service traffic. We address unique log formats and behaviors of different forwarders and recommend practices for specific units. Finally, we discuss means to integrate investigation triggers and results into existing Security Information and Event Management deployments, empowering cyber-defense analysts without further complicating their workflows.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956734","cyber-defense;cyber-security;network","Detectors;Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Internet;Ports (Computers);Servers","IP networks;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IP transaction tracking;Internet protocol networks;SIOD;centralized cyber defense;cyber security functions;cyber-defense analysts;event management deployments;network address translation;prototype tracing algorithm;pseudo-code;security incident origin discovery;security information;traffic flow;traffic forwarding techniques","","0","","15","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ACMS algorithm also provides high flexibility that it can be tuned to fit specific performance requirement and resource constraints.

In this paper, we try to build an efficient defense system based on a cooperative scheme to detect intrusions in AODV-based ad hoc networks using clustering technique and Back Propagation Network (BPN). A clustering architecture provides network scalability and fault tolerance, and results in more efficient use of network resources.

All steps of PCA starting from the mean computation to the projection of data onto the new space, passing by the normalization process, covariance matrix and the eigenvectors computation are developed in C and synthesized using the new Xilinx VIVADO high level synthesis (HLS). The computation of the eigenvectors was based on the iterative Jacobi method. The designed hardware for computing the learning part of PCA on the Zynq system on chip showed that it can be faster than its 64-bit Intel i7-3770 processor counterpart with a speed up of 1.41.

The PNA is implemented on commodity hardware and can enforce network policy in real-time at the granularity of network frame arrival. This paper describes the system, and its evaluation in both laboratory and real-world deployments.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","978-0-7695-4521-9","10.1109/ANCS.2011.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062742","Computer-Communication Networks;Network Monitoring;Network Operations","Hardware;IP networks;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Real time systems","telecommunication network management;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication security","capacity planning;commodity hardware;laboratory;network administrators;network management;network policy;passive network appliance;real-time network monitoring;real-world deployments;security","","3","","23","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Traffic flow management in next generation service provider networks — Are we there yet?","Goss, R.; Botha, R.","Inst. for ICT Advancement, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ., Port Elizabeth, South Africa","Information Security South Africa (ISSA), 2011","20110926","2011","","","1","6","For years a number of savvy Internet users have avoided firewalls and traffic engineering measures by directing traffic through ports seemingly unrelated to the application. These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as “safe” or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic “in the dark”.","","978-1-4577-1481-8","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529","Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;IPv6;Network Flow Classification;Service Providers;VPN","Encryption;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IP tunneling;data packet opaque;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;next generation service provider network;opaque traffic classification;quality of service system;traffic flow management","","0","","19","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The files created or modified by the monitored applications will be marked with a suspicious label; when a file with suspicious label is accessed, a predefined scanning tool or other mechanisms in user-land will be invoked to check the file. The file labeling and access mediation are done in kernel, thus is mandatory and transparent to user applications; the scanning mechanisms are implemented in user land, thus flexible for user to customize.

As cloud based computing becomes more ubiquitous, commercial building occupants are utilizing cloud based solutions for managing work schedules. Consequently, the opportunity exists to exploit these whole building occupant schedules to infer occupancy levels throughout the building. In addition, when combined with data from directional passive infrared sensors, and a knowledge of the number of mobile users on Wi-Fi access points, the occupancy profiles can be adjusted based on actively sensed occupancy.

We show how current NFV and SDN architectures could support elastic resource services for network functions (NFs). We reveal that the current NFV architecture does not allow recursive resource orchestration, therefore preventing resource scaling requests from being handled by a resource orchestrator overseeing the entire domain where an NF is executed.

We propose to use the state of correlation between parameters to detect an attack. First we show how to select effective security parameters for our detection engine with statistical correlation methods. Then, we propose how to build correlation relation graphs (CRG) for the parameters showing higher correlation.

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security.

Networks are complex systems, and a comprehensive intrusion detection solution has to be able to manage event streams with different content, speed, level of abstraction, and accessibility.

When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s. It is included in the vibration signal caused by a walking intruder inevitably. So the detection system output signal caused by a human intrusion is intermittent and periodical. If a sensing system output waveform has a period of 0.3–0.75s and a duration time of 0.15–0.25s, the disturbance source can be adjudged as a human intrusion, not as an animal or other random one.

SPIE-enhanced routers maintain a cache of packet digests for recently forwarded traffic. If a packet is determined to be offensive by an intrusion detection system (or judged interesting by some other metric), a query is dispatched to the SPIE system that, in turn, queries routers for packet digests of the relevant time periods. ne results of this query are used in a simulated reverse-path flooding algorithm to build a highly reliable and accurate attack graph that identifies the packet's source or sources.","","0-7695-1897-4","","10.1109/DISCEX.2003.1194937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194937","","Computer crime;Data structures;Dissolved gas analysis;Engines;Floods;History;Intrusion detection;Isolation technology;TCPIP;Technological innovation","security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","SPIE;Source Path Isolation Engine;attack graph;cache;forwarded traffic;hashes;intrusion detection system;memory requirement;packet digests;query;routers;simulated reverse-path flooding algorithm;single IP packet traceback;tap boxes","","0","","","","","22-24 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need is not only for preventing the attack but also for detecting such attacks if it happened. Intrusion detection systems is built to do this task and complement other security systems.

We use a multivariate time series technique to forecast the hacker's behavior effectively. Our back-propagation neural network model results have been compared with traditional statistical forecasting models, and a better prediction accuracy has been observed.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","","978-1-4244-7271-0","","10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380","Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","20","","","13-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We performed experiments on three datasets, namely, the traditional UNM dataset as well as two modern datasets, Firefox and ADFA-LD.

Rule learning, neural networks, statistics, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are some of the kinds of representative methods for intrusion detection. Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously.

The shared feature set consisted of features agreed by the two feature selection algorithms and therefore considered important features for identifying intrusions. Human intervention was then conducted to find an optimal number of features in between the combined (maximum) and shared feature sets (minimum).

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","0","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researchers and enterprises have already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy. Security is another problem involved in this paper. Since many researchers have done many detailed and fruitful studies in security, the security solution illustrated in this paper is specific in the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4673-3027-5","","10.1109/CGC.2012.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6382904","cloud computing;grouping algorithm;identity management (IdM);security;service oriented architecture (SOA)","Authentication;Authorization;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Service oriented architecture","cloud computing;data privacy;open systems;service-oriented architecture","SOA;centralized component processing authentication requests;centralized component processing authorization requests;cloud computing;decentralized approach;federated solution;grouping algorithm;identity management deploying strategy;identity management optimization;identity management usability;interoperability problems;privacy problems;security improvement;service-oriented architecture","","0","","16","","","1-3 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Labeling Network Event Records for Intrusion Detection in aWireless LAN","Khoshgoftaar, T.M.; Seiffert, C.; Seliya, N.","Comput. Sci. & Eng., Florida Atlantic Univ., Boca Raton, FL","Information Reuse and Integration, 2006 IEEE International Conference on","20061204","2006","","","200","206","A data mining approach to network intrusion detection requires a training dataset of network event records labeled as either normal or an attack type. Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy","","0-7803-9788-6","","10.1109/IRI.2006.252413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490","","Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN","clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do that, we introduce two anomaly intrusion detection methods based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approaches outperform those used in [1].","","","","10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232998","Anomaly intrusion detection;Audit trail analysis;Intrusion detection;Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis;Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrices;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","data analysis;principal component analysis;security of data;vectors","KFDA;KPCA;anomaly intrusion detection method;data analysis method;discriminant factor;discrimination rule;kernel fisher discriminant analysis;kernel principal component analysis;vector","","0","","13","","","25-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Those associative applications and services based on cloud computing are dramatically emerging. However, in order to enjoy the widely utilization of cloud computing through wired/wireless networking, providing sufficient assurance of information security such as confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity is the critical factor of success promotion. In this paper, a dynamic intrusion detection system for strengthening the security application of cloud computing is proposed. In the proposed mechanism, numbers of intrusion detectors are dispatched on the whole topology of the networking system through multi-layers and multi-stages deployment. Those information security issues related with the application and service of cloud computing will be experimented and discussed.

We use the multi-agent paradigm to model the proposed distributed system. In this system, an agent, which plays several roles, is situated on each node of the net. The first role of an agent is to perform the work of a local intrusion detection system (IDS). Periodically, it proceeds to exchange security data within its local neighbouring. The agent neighbouring consists of IDS agents of local neighbour nodes. The goal of such an approach is to consolidate the decision, regarding every suspected security event. Unlike previous works having proposed distributed systems for intrusion detection, our system is not restricted to data sharing. It proceeds in the case of a conflict to a negotiation between neighbouring agents in order to produce a consensual decision. So, the proposed system is fully distributed. It does not require any central or hierarchical control, which compromises its scalability, specially in wide area networks such as Internet. Indeed, in this kind of networks, some attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) require fully distributed defence. Experiments on our system show its potential for satisfactory DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4799-3019-7","","10.1109/INISTA.2014.6873596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873596","DDoS;IDS;Intrusion detection;Multi-agent systems;Network security","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Internet;Intrusion detection;Multi-agent systems;Wide area networks","Internet;computer network security;multi-agent systems;wide area networks","IDS;Internet;agent neighbouring;collective intrusion detection;data sharing;distributed denial of service;distributed system;local neighbour nodes;multiagent paradigm;satisfactory DDoS attack detection;security data;security event;wide area networks","","0","","15","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A real-world environment could be different from the environment designed for a testbed. The results obtained, from such testbeds, may not be accurate and reliable. Hence, a quantitative and metrics based evaluation of IDSs is desired. We propose testbed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (TIDeS), that allows a user to select the best IDS for a specific customized environment.

However, existing device-free solutions mainly use sensors and active RFID tags, which are much more expensive compared to passive tags. In this paper, we propose a novel motion detection and tracking method using passive RFID tags, named Twins. The method leverages a phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We theoretically explain this phenomenon via an interference model and conduct extensive experiment to validate it. We design a practical Twins based intrusion detection system and implement a real prototype with commercial off-the-shelf reader and tags. Experimental results show that Twins is effective in detecting the moving object, with low location errors of 0.75m in average.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847970","Critical State;Device-free;Passive RFID tag;Tracking","Antennas;Couplings;Motion detection;Particle filters;Prototypes;Radiofrequency identification;Tracking","motion estimation;object detection;object tracking;radiofrequency identification;radiofrequency interference;safety systems","Twins based intrusion detection system;active RFID tags;commercial off-the-shelf reader;critical state;device-free based object tracking;device-free solutions;interference model;location errors;motion detection method;noncooperative objects;passive RFID tags;tracking method;tracking systems","","6","","36","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experiments on public datasets showed that OPF classifier may be a suitable tool to detect intrusions on computer networks, as well as allow the algorithm to learn new attacks faster than the other techniques.","0742-1303","978-1-61284-926-3","","10.1109/LCN.2011.6115182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6115182","","Accuracy;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Prototypes;Training;Vegetation","artificial intelligence;computer network security;neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines","OPF classifier;artificial intelligence;computer networks;intrusion detection system;neural networks;optimum-path forest;pattern classifier;pattern recognition;public datasets;real time retraining;support vector machines;training patterns","","1","","22","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are basically two main types of detection techniques: signature-based and anomaly-based. A signature-based IDS cannot detect unknown attacks because a signature has not been written. To overcome this shortcoming, many researchers have been developing anomaly-based IDSs. Although they can detect unknown attacks, there is a problem that they just classify network traffic into normal or abnormal. Therefore, IDS operators have to manually inspect IDS alerts to classify them into known attacks or unknown attacks. Because there are a lot of alerts related to known attacks, it is difficult to extract only unknown attacks from them. In this paper, we present a method that automatically detects unknown attacks from an anomaly-based IDS alerts. We evaluate our method using Kyoto2006+ dataset.","","978-1-4673-2001-6","978-0-7695-4737-4","10.1109/SAINT.2012.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305297","anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;unknown attacks","Educational institutions;Feature extraction;IP networks;Support vector machines;Testing;Training data","digital signatures;feature extraction;security of data","IDS operators;Kyoto2006+ dataset;anomaly-based IDS alerts;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;computer systems;feature extraction;network traffic;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection systems;unknown attacks detection","","2","","7","","","16-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we evaluated via simulation the impact of a passive attacker, a denial of service (DoS) attack, and a data swallowing attack. We compared two different adaptive network responses to these attacks against a baseline of no response for 10 and 20 node networks. Each response reflects a level of trust assigned to the captured node. Our simulation used a responsive variant of the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing algorithm and focused on the response performance. We assumed that the attacks had been detected and reported. We compared performance tradeoffs of attack, response, and network size by focusing on metrics such as ""goodput"", i.e. percentage of messages that reach the intended destination untainted by the captured node. We showed, for example, that under general conditions a DoS attack response should minimize attacker impact while a response to a data swallowing attack should minimize risk to the system and trust of the compromised node with most of the response benefit. We show that the best network response depends on the mission goals, network configuration, density, network performance, attacker skill, and degree of compromise.","","0-7803-8140-8","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290104","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Communications technology;Computer crime;Electronic mail;Intelligent networks;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing","ad hoc networks;military communication;telecommunication network routing","adaptive network;data swallowing attack;denial of service attack;on-demand distance vector routing algorithm;passive attacker;system adaptation;tactical ad hoc networks;tactical communications;trust response","","0","","5","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware. However; Snort detection capability is not improved by improving hardware and is dependent upon its internal architecture (signature database and rate filtration).

The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets or timing jitter. Such evasion techniques cause most of the previous timing-based detection algorithms to fail. In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others. We examine the selected parameters and provide different trade-offs among false rates.

However, even the state-of-the-art NIDS has small chances of detecting them because they rely on known signatures. This paper presents hybrid detection for zero-day polymorphic shellcodes (HDPS) against shellcodes using various obfuscations. Our approach employs a heuristic approach to detect return address and filter mass innocent network flows, and then constructs a Markov model to detect the existence and location of executable codes in suspicious flows. Finally, it applies an elaborate approach to detect NOP Sleds in the executable codes. Initial experiments show HDPS detects nearly all types of shellcodes, and the false positive rate approximates zero with low overhead.","","978-1-4244-2909-7","978-1-4244-2910-3","10.1109/EBISS.2009.5137874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137874","","Buffer overflow;Computer architecture;Computer science;Genetic mutations;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Statistics","Internet;Markov processes;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Markov model;NOP Sleds detection;complex obfuscation technique;heuristic approach;hybrid zero-day polymorphic shellcode detection approach;mass innocent network flow filtering;state-of-the-art NIDS;suspicious flow","","1","","10","","","23-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Lightweight IDS Based on Features Selection and IDS Classification Scheme","Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Computational Science and Engineering, 2009. CSE '09. International Conference on","20091009","2009","3","","365","370","The intrusion detection system (IDS) deals with huge amount of data which contains irrelevant and redundant features causing slow training and testing process, higher resource consumption as well as poor detection rate. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of lightweight IDS. The lightweight IDSs are small, powerful, and flexible enough to be used as permanent elements of the network security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility. To design the proposed system, several experiments have been conducted, and they indicate that the proposed lightweight IDS can deliver satisfactory system performance.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283334","Intrusion Detection Systems;Support Decision Function;features classification.;features ranking;features selection","Data engineering;Fuzzy sets;IP networks;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Scalability;System performance;System testing;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;support vector machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP/IP network model;application layer IDS;feature selection;fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function algorithm;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS classification scheme;link layer IDS;network layer IDS;network security;transport layer IDS","","1","","25","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this protocol, security assertion markup language (SAML) based authentication assertions are used to encapsulate the conversation context as well as the conversation target identity authentication information into a secure context token. Our protocol is conformant to the emerging Web services standards of WS-trust and WS-secure conversation.

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","8 pp.","","We have built a system for protecting Internet services to securely connected, known users. It implements a generate-and-test approach for on-line attack identification and uses similarity rules for generalization of attack signatures. We can immediately protect the system from many variants of previously unknown attacks without debilitating waits for anti-virus updates or software patches. Unique to our approach is the use of diverse process pairs not only for isolation benefits but also for detection. The architecture uses the comparison of outputs from diverse applications to provide a significant and novel intrusion detection capability. With this technique, we gain the benefits of n-version programming without its controversial disadvantages. The isolation of intrusions is mainly achieved with an out-of-band control system that separates the primary and backup system. It also initiates attack diagnosis and blocking, and recovery, which is accelerated by continual repair.","","0-7695-1874-5","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174911","","Computer networks;Control systems;Data security;Error correction;Fault diagnosis;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Protection","Internet;authorisation;message authentication;telecommunication security","Internet services;antivirus updates;attack diagnosis;attack prevention;attack signatures generalization;generate-and-test approach;n-version programming;on-line attack identification;on-line intrusion detection;out-of-band control system;software patches","","3","4","18","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) that models normal behaviors with hidden Markov models (HMM) and attempts to detect intrusions by noting significant deviations from the models. Among several soft computing techniques neural network and fuzzy logic are incorporated into the system to achieve robustness and flexibility. The self-organizing map (SOM) determines the optimal measures of audit data and reduces them into appropriate size for efficient modeling by HMM. Based on several models with different measures, fuzzy logic makes the final decision of whether current behavior is abnormal or not. Experimental results with some real audit data show that the proposed fusion produces a viable intrusion detection system. Fuzzy rules that utilize the models based on the measures of system call, file access, and the combination of them produce more reliable performance.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2002.801356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039199","","Computer industry;Computer networks;Current measurement;Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Robustness;Size measurement;Uncertainty","fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;probability;security of data;self-organising feature maps;uncertainty handling","anomaly detection;audit data;experimental results;file access;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rules;hard computing;hidden Markov models;imprecision;industrial applications;neural network;performance;probabilistic intrusion detection system;robustness;self-organizing map;soft computing;system call;uncertainty","","33","","20","","","May 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
