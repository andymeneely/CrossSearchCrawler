Because of the challenges in programming such architectures, realizing this promise has proved to be difficult. In this paper, we describe the design of Lagniappe, a programming environment that simplifies the design of portable, high-throughput applications on multi-* architectures. Lagniappe uses a hybrid programming model: it combines a procedural specification (e.g., in C++) of the basic operators for processing requests with a declarative specification - expressed using a model-driven development framework - of the various features of the operators and the target hardware platform. Using the declarative specification, the Lagniappe programming environment automates the mapping of applications onto the multi-* platform, performs dynamic allocation of resources to operators, and ensures efficient and coherent accesses to persistent, shared state.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-1251-8","978-1-4244-1251-8","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317815","","Computer architecture;Computer graphics;Dynamic programming;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Process design;Programming environments;Service oriented architecture;Virtual private networks;Web server","message passing;multiprogramming;object-oriented languages;programming environments;software portability","Lagniappe;declarative specification;high-throughput applications;hybrid programming model;model-driven development framework;multi-* architectures;multi-threaded architectures;multiprocessor;multiprogramming;portable application;procedural specification;programming environment;target hardware platform","","0","","28","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Embedded VCA in vehicles can track pedestrians to avoid collisions, improving safety. Used in railway station, VCA are able to detect left luggage allowing to enhance security.

IEEE International Conference on","20070904","2007","","","190","195","In this paper, a framework is proposed to defend against Internet bandwidth attacks with traffic resource management to provide service for legitimate users. Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.","","1-4244-1500-4","1-4244-1500-4","10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management","","0","","14","","","13-15 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The typical insider in a DMS already has access to documents and hence, his capabilities for information leakage are much higher. In this work, we address an important, yet unexplored problem of masquerading users in a DMS, a threat for which the DMS inherently has no protection. We approach the problem by monitoring the pattern and mannerism of user actions on documents and building a profile of each user using the resulting logs. In order to illustrate our ideas, we built user profiles of 41 users working on Microsoft Word and applied two algorithms, viz., IPAM and NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes to distinguish between them. When supplied with appropriately interpreted command sequences of a DMS, IPAM was able to distinguish between users effectively, while NaÃÂ¯ve Bayes failed to produce any meaningful results.

However, such error tolerance comes at a high price of attack survivability. In this paper, to enhance such attack survivability, we propose a new formulation used for defense against deliberately attacks based on two leading concepts: cost and load. The cost measures how expensive it is to cure an attacked or infected node, and the load measures how important a link between two nodes is when propagating attacks or updating immunization information reversely. The combination of these factors leads us to introduce the concept of optimal targeted immunization, which formalizes the ideas of minimizing the risk of epidemic outbreaks in these networks. Using this analysis framework, we then devise a novel efficient targeted immunization scheme. The simulation results under a realistic Gnutella network show that our immunization scheme outperforms other existing methods, producing an arresting increase of the network attack tolerance at a lower price of eliminating malicious attacks.","","0-7695-2405-2","","10.1109/PDCAT.2005.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1578966","","Biological system modeling;Computer errors;Computer science;Costs;Fluctuations;Guidelines;Immune system;Peer to peer computing;Performance gain;Robustness","","","","1","","11","","","05-08 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PEGs are designed to help realize DSP systems in terms of forms and granularities of parallelism that are well matched to the given applications and targeted platforms. PEGs also facilitate derivation of both static and dynamic scheduling techniques,depending on the amount of variability in task execution times and other operating conditions. We show how to implement efficient PEG-based scheduling methods using real time operating systems, and to re-use pre-optimized libraries of DSP components within such implementations. Empirical results show that the PEG strategy can 1) achieve significant speedups on a state of the art multicore signal processor platform for static dataflow applications with predictable execution times,and 2) exceed classical scheduling speedups for application shaving execution times that can vary dynamically. This ability to handle variable execution times is especially useful as DSP applications and platforms increase in complexity and adaptive behavior, thereby reducing execution time predictability.","2160-0511","978-1-4673-2243-0","978-0-7695-4768-8","10.1109/ASAP.2012.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341457","Data?ow Graphs;Digital Signal Processing;Multiprocessor Dynamic Scheduling","Digital signal processing;Dynamic scheduling;Multicore processing;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules","protocols;radio networks;signal processing","DSP applications;DSP components;PEG;digital signal processing;dynamic adaptation;dynamic scheduling opportunities;dynamic scheduling techniques;exposing parallelism;online reconfiguration;partial expansion graphs;real time operating systems;wireless communications protocols","","1","","16","","","9-11 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ICON 2008. 16th IEEE International Conference on","20090202","2008","","","1","4","Scanning tools are commonly used by intruders for identifying vulnerable hosts and applications in a network. So from security perspective, to identify the attack in its initial stage and to minimize the impact of attack, it is important to detect scanning activities in a network. We have mainly considered TCP flow because most of the Internet application uses it as a transport protocol. Traditionally, TCP scan traffic detection uses either flag values in the TCP packet header or statistical properties of the connection parameter like number of failed connection attempts. In this paper, we present a novel behaviour analysis of TCP traffic, where by using the flow characteristics, we identify anomalies and scan activities in a network or host. The proposed method provides a generic solution to SYN scan (half open), connect scan, FIN scan, Xmas scan and null scan.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) provide an important layer of security for computer systems and networks, and are becoming more and more crucial issue. To detect the attacks hitting the network it is very obligatory to properly monitor the flow of network data. Network data is pre-processed before classification. Feature Selection is one of the preprocessing technique which eliminates irrelevant features and select more informative features from the data set with respect to the task to be performed. Feature Selection techniques is adopted as it is computationally efficient, simplified, have more feature interpretability, less learning time, improves data relevancy. Feature Selection can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies. Feature Selection selects a subset of the features in the training set and further using this subset as features in classification. Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features from the dataset. On selecting the features, classification is performed for detecting the intrusion.","","978-9-3805-4415-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100415","Attribute Evaluator;Classification;Dimensional Reduction;Feature Extraction;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Intrusion Detection","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Search methods","data reduction;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","IDS;classifier combination;dimension reduction technique;feature selection;intrusion detection system","","0","","17","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the design and implementation of NBTRL, a software platform for network background traffic replay based on log files applied to IDS testing. NBTRL consists of information extraction module, packet preprocessing module and replay module.

Fates views the monitored network as a collection of individual hosts instead of as a single autonomous entity and uses dynamic, individual threshold for each monitored host, such that it can differentiate between characteristics of individual hosts and independently assess their threat to the network. Each packet to and from a monitored host is analyzed with an adaptive and efficient charging scheme that considers the packet's type, number of occurrences, source, and destination. The resulting charge is applied to the individual hosts' threat assessment, providing pinpointed analysis of anomalous activities. We use various datasets to validate Fates's ability to distinguish scanning behavior from benign traffic in real time.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-1251-8","978-1-4244-1251-8","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317884","Anomaly-based Detection;Network-based Intrusion Detection System","Computer science;Entropy;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Real time systems;Signal detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer network management;real-time systems;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Fates real-time anomaly-based network intrusion detection system;network host monitoring;network traffic;real-time anomaly detection","","0","","25","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secure routing in sensor networks is a difficult problem due to the resources limitations in WSN. Moreover, multihop routing in WSN is affected by new nodes constantly entering/leaving the system. Therefore, biologically inspired algorithms are reviewed and enhanced to tackle problems arise in WSN. Ant routing and human self security systems have shown an excellent performance for WSNs. Certain parameters like energy level, link quality, lose rate are considered while making decision. This decision will come up with the optimal route and also to take best action against the security attacks. In this paper, the design and initial work on BIOlogical-inspired self-organized Secure Autonomous Routing Protocol (BIOSARP) for WSNs is presented. The proposed bio-inspired algorithm will also meet the enhanced sensor network requirements, including energy consumption, success rate and time.","","978-0-7695-3580-7","","10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5176006","ANT Colony;Human Immune System;Self-Organized;Self-healing;Wireless Sensor Network","Ant colony optimization;Biosensors;Data security;Humans;Monitoring;Particle swarm optimization;Routing protocols;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","biomimetics;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","blological-inspired self-organized secure autonomous routing protocol;energy consumption;energy level;environmental monitoring;human self security systems;link quality;lose rate;multihop routing;nature inspired self-organized secure autonomous mechanism;object tracking applications;optimal route;secure routing;wireless sensor network","","1","","30","","","1-3 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using our framework, we also place intrusion alarms in the context of vulnerability-based attack graphs, so that false alarms become apparent and missed detections can be inferred. We introduce a graphical technique that shows multiple-step attacks by matching rows and columns of the clustered adjacency matrix.

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios.

In each stage, parallel SRAMs are used to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Transition rules can be efficiently stored and accessed in one cycle.

As the idea of filtering the traffic at the entrance door, by using firewalls and the like, is not completely successful, the use of intrusion detection systems should be considered to increase the defense capacity of an information system. This paper presents a NeuroC4.5 based approach to network intrusion detection to detect anomalies in the computer networks. Decision tree is with good comprehensibility while neural network is with strong generalization ability. So, these merits are integrated into a novel decision tree algorithm NeuroC4.5. The NeuroC4.5 is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data. The generated rules are then used to detect network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing decision tree based approaches, the spawned rules are more effective because the generalization ability of NeuroC4.5 decision trees is better than that of C4.5 decision trees. A comparative evaluation of the proposed NeuroC4.5 model with the classical C4.5 algorithm, on audit data set provided by MIT Lincoln labs, has been presented; superior detection accuracy has been reported by our proposed model","","1-4244-0369-3","1-4244-0370-7","10.1109/INDCON.2006.302774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086245","Decision Tree;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Network Security;Neural Network","Authentication;Computer networks;Decision trees;Educational institutions;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","authorisation;computer networks;decision trees;filtering theory;information systems;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","MIT Lincoln labs;NeuroC4.5 algorithm;computer networks;decision tree algorithm;firewall;information system;network intrusion detection;neural network;traffic filtering","","0","","12","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible. In the paper a performance of the evolved fuzzy classifiers with a classification accuracy of 92% is presented.","","978-1-4673-0088-9","","10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6272759","Fuzzy Logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection","","","","","0","","18","","","25-27 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, Web applications tend to be error prone and implementation vulnerabilities are readily and commonly exploited by attackers. The design of countermeasures that detect or prevent such vulnerabilities or protect against their exploitation is an important research challenge for the fields of software engineering and security engineering. In this paper, we focus on one specific type of implementation vulnerability, namely, broken dependencies on session data. This vulnerability can lead to a variety of erroneous behavior at runtime and can easily be triggered by a malicious user by applying attack techniques such as forceful browsing. This paper shows how to guarantee the absence of runtime errors due to broken dependencies on session data in Web applications. The proposed solution combines development-time program annotation, static verification, and runtime checking to provably protect against broken data dependencies. We have developed a prototype implementation of our approach, building on the JML annotation language and the existing static verification tool ESC/Java2, and we successfully applied our approach to a representative J2EE-based e-commerce application. We show that the annotation overhead is very small, that the performance of the fully automatic static verification is acceptable, and that the performance overhead of the runtime checking is limited.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2007.70742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359468","Data sharing;Reliability;Security;Security and Protection;Software/Program Verification;Web technologies;Web-based services","","Web services;programming languages","J2EE-based e-commerce application;JML annotation language;Web application vulnerabilities;provable protection;security engineering;session data dependencies;software engineering","","2","1","48","","","Jan.-Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Not all communications are credible and malpractice can arise anywhere, anytime. If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its open nature and the lack of robust security mechanisms, SIP is vulnerable to several attacks similar to those existing in Internet infrastructure, such as the flooding attack. An attacker can use any SIP request to launch a flooding attack, leading to severe consequences at either client or server side SIP elements or both of them. In this context, end user's devices are considered more vulnerable to flooding attacks due to their limited capabilities. In this paper, we focus on INVITE flooding attack for which we propose a simple and robust detection scheme. This scheme prevents an attacker from launching an INVITE flood through a transition state table used by the proxy to analyse the incoming INVITE requests and exclude the suspicious ones. Our scheme requires also that the end-user keeps track of the time and IP addresses of each incoming request. Furthermore, we modify the header of the REGISTER request by adding a new field named Critical number which holds the value of maximum number of users or callers that could easily be handled by the end user. Unlike the existing solutions, our scheme does not require any special detection device or firewall at the SIP server. The proposed mechanism has been implemented in SIP Express Router (SER) and the obtained results have confirmed its effectiveness.","","978-1-4673-5615-2","978-1-4673-5614-5","10.1109/WMNC.2013.6549057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549057","Denial of Service;INVITE Flooding Attack;Security;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP);Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)","Computer crime;IP networks;Protocols;Registers;Servers;Time factors","IP networks;Internet telephony;computer network security;network servers;routing protocols;signalling protocols;video communication","INVITE flooding attack;IP address;Internet;REGISTER request header;SER;SIP express router;SIP server;critical number;firewall;incoming INVITE request analysis;lightweight countermeasure;robust detection scheme;robust security mechanism;session initiation protocol;transition state table;video communication;voice communication","","0","","13","","","23-25 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules. We show that this automated approach is effective in reducing the number of false alarms when compared to other widely used and maintained IDSs.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721565","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Application software;Computer security;Databases;Drives;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protocols;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;digital signatures;program verification","data mining algorithm;intrusion detection verification rule;malicious behavior;network traffic monitoring;signature-based network security","","3","","22","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks. The new stage of this research will take the mobility into account. So for, a group of algorithms have been created and correlated in parallel and serial configurations to present the proposed vision for NIDS.

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the most sought after system by security experts in safeguarding the network from both external and internal attacks. NIDS works mainly in two modes: Online and Offline. Online or real-time NIDS, such as Snort, Bro, etc., examines the packet structure to find intrusions, if any, and alerts the administrator. On the other hand, offline NIDS logs the packets flowing to and from the network, constructs features based on connections, and creates a dataset. Such NIDS datasets are used in research purposes for applying data mining, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc., to detect attacks. KDD CUP 99 is one such widely used popular IDS dataset. KDD CUP 99 dataset is obsolete because many of the attacks performed to create the dataset do not exist now. Moreover, the features constructed do not pertain to network activities. It is a mixture of host based as well as network based features. So, the need for a new dataset, conforming to the present network activities and attack vectors, is inevitable. This motivated us to come out with a NIDS dataset, SSENet-2011 dataset, in this paper. SSENet-2011 dataset was constructed using Tstat tool. A real time experiment was performed, the network packets were captured, features were constructed, and the dataset was created. The created SSENet-2011 dataset was compared with the KDD CUP 99 dataset.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance. We validate our approach by testing it on a flow-based probabilistic detection system for the detection of SSH attacks.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2012.031512.110146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6172597","Autonomic;anomalies;intrusion detection;network management;parameter optimization","Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Optimization;Time series analysis;Tuning","probability;security of data","SSH attacks;SSH case study;anomaly-based IDS;autonomic parameter tuning;expert IT personnel;false alarms;flow-based probabilistic detection system;intrusion attempt;intrusion detection;network behavior;network traffic instances;system manager","","4","","41","","2012-03-21","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT), as one of the main vulnerabilities of VoIP systems, is becoming an interesting source of annoyance for spammers. Transmitting bulk unsolicited messages and calls in a VoIP system could be facilitated with the use of an automated procedure (i.e., bot). As the effectiveness of legal actions in preventing these attacks is limited, various ANTI-SPIT technologies have been developed. Some approaches try to detect a sender as a spammer while he is attempting to generate calls and messages, and some others try to establish an infrastructure which makes the system unlikely for a spammer, so they prevent SPIT. Selecting one of these two approaches, (Detection or Prevention) could certainly move large volume of market share between companies. In this paper, after surveying different ANTI-SPIT solutions, a competition between two VoIP providers is proposed. Game Theory method is used to simulate this competition. Results illustrate that apart from the scientific efforts made to prevent SPIT, the VoIP providers trying to maximize their profit, prefer to use detective approaches instead.","","978-1-4577-2058-1","","10.1109/ICCAIE.2011.6162168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162168","Game theory;SIP;SPIT","Companies;Game theory;Games;Internet telephony;Protocols;Servers;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet telephony;computer network security;game theory","ANTISPIT technologies;SPITTERS;VoIP providers;VoIP systems;detection;game-theory method;prevention;spam over Internet telephony;voice over Internet protocol","","3","","17","","","4-7 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since effective remediation requires that the right actions be taken at the right time, in order for SEC&DEP monitoring to be really useful, the results of the monitoring process must be made available in a timely fashion, i.e. in (near) real-time. A plethora of technologies exists, that individually represent a (potentially) effective building block of a real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility, but - regrettably - they very much lack integration. We claim that a significant advancement in the convergence of such technologies is needed. While recently some achievements have been made, much is yet to be done. In this paper, we briefly review the current State Of The Art (SOTA) of technologies that can be used to implement a real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility, with two objectives: 1) perform a gap analysis, i.e. point out the major limitations of such technologies, and 2) identify the main avenues towards effective SEC&DEP monitoring.","","978-1-4799-3530-7","","10.1109/CCST.2014.6987018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987018","Event Collection;Event Correlation;Fault and Intrusion Tolerance;Real-time monitoring","Business;Correlation;Monitoring;Random access memory;Real-time systems;Security;Sensors","fault tolerant computing;security of data","building block;monitoring process;real-time SEC&DEP monitoring facility;real-time security & dependability monitoring","","0","","24","","","13-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed security system consists of firewall, syslog server and email server and is implemented in real environment and tested against some frequent DoS attacks. The easiest attacks were realized through the frequent (FTP, HTTP, RDP) open ports to the VPN network and successfully detected.

The evaluation approaches to detect and assess the security risk level of cyber-attacks are harder to develop due to lack of information such as scope of attack and the way it originate. This paper assess the security risk level of those attacks which are targeting to IT, business networks and critical infrastructure, and where malicious user's actions are direct threats to the targeted system but yet not visible by the targeted system. This is achieved after classifying each Google dorks (commands) as an invisible attacks according to their characteristics. In addition, a method is devised to secure any organization's network against invisible attacks by creating a rule in Snort NIDPS signature database. Furthermore, OWASP risk rating methodology is incorporated to assess the overall severity risk level of invisible attacks on the network in terms of high, medium and low. Since, this method does not provide the quantitative security risk value of enterprise network, therefore, quantitative security risk assessment of enterprise network is determined using severity risk assessment table.","","","","10.1109/FiCloud.2015.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300826","Google hacking;Network security;attack detection;attack mitigation;attack visibility;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);risk assessment","Companies;Google;Malware;Risk management;Search engines","business data processing;search engines;security of data","Google dork;OWASP risk rating methodology;Snort NIDPS signature database;business network;business process;critical infrastructure;cyber-attack;enterprise network;invisible attack;network information system;quantitative security risk assessment;security community;security risk level;security risk value;severity risk assessment table","","","","","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It involves eliminating redundant and irrelevant features from the dataset to get a subset of features, which performs as efficient as the complete set. The wrapper approach to the problem of feature selection is to use an induction algorithm to select the features. Most induction algorithms fail to handle large datasets. The obvious method that can be employed to handle large datasets is ""divide and conquer"". This paper introduces a strategy for finding features from a collection of distributed subsets using the BLEM2 rule-based inductive learning program. Heurstics for determining proper number of subsets and proper subset size are proposed.

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the average path length in the network and show that this parameter will not have a significant increment using our algorithm. All analytical results are also validated by simulation to make them dependable.","","978-1-4673-6239-9","978-0-7695-4952-1","10.1109/WAINA.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550422","Asymmetric Cryptography;Connectivity;Large Scale MANETs;Probabilistic Key Management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Public key","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security","asymmetric cryptography;intermediate node;large-scale MANET;memory;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;network path length;probabilistic key management algorithm;probability;process capability;secure environment;security","","1","","40","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a quantification method for NSSA based on conditional random fields(CRFs) was proposed. The data of network attacks from intrusion detection system (IDS), the hosts' vulnerabilities and the hosts' states were firstly combined as the network security factors. And then the network security threat degree was defined to quantify the risk of the whole network and classify the attacks. A diverse set of effective features were incorporated in CRFs Model. Finally the experiments on the DARPA 2000 data set generate the explicit network security situational graph. It proves that the method introduced in this paper can represent network risk more accurate and offer a good quantification for the network security situation.","","978-1-4244-5244-6","978-0-7695-3896-9","10.1109/ICCIT.2009.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369556","conditional random fields;network security situational awareness;network security threat degree","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Petroleum","security of data","DARPA 2000 data set;conditional random fields;intrusion detection system;network security factors;network security situational awareness;network security situational graph","","1","","14","","","24-26 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To minimize the chances of these attacks succeeding, the administrator of an organizationpsilas DNS (called the zone administrator), has various counter measures options in the form of content control, configuration, protocols, operational and infrastructure protection methods.

But current regular expression matching algorithms or architecture cannot provide a perfect solution for whole matching problem. In some real network security applications, exact strings are the biggest part of rule set, and the second part is simple regular expressions (dot-star and AND-logic), and the other complex regular expressions only occupy a very small part. So, we propose a new hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture, called MSRM, for Dot-Star and AND-logic regular expressions. Firstly, software compiler splits simple regular expressions into exact strings and relations. Multi-string-matching module judges whether strings match and outputs the matched ID. Based on these matched information and pre-generated RAM data, MSRM can judge whether dot-star and AND-logic regular expressions are satisfied easily and quickly. Experiments with random test data and ClamAV rule set show that MSRM can achieve a high throughput of 2.1 and 2.8 Gbps using Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively which is much higher than software algorithms.","","978-1-4244-2682-9","978-1-4244-2683-6","10.1109/APCSAC.2008.4625475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625475","","Application software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Coprocessors;Doped fiber amplifiers;Hardware;Impedance matching;Information security;Inspection;Pattern matching","computer architecture;coprocessors;logic gates","AND-logic;AND-logic regular expressions;RAM data;Virtex2 devices;Virtex4 devices;content inspection;dot-star;hardware-based multiple simple regular expression matching architecture;packet inspection coprocessor;pattern matching;software algorithms","","0","","26","","","4-6 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of these characters, MANETs operate in open medium, so they are particularly vulnerable to intrusions. In this paper, we present an efficient intrusion detection system called MAPIDS (Mobile Agent-based Peer-to-peer Intrusion Detection System). On detecting a suspicious activity, MAPIDS initiates a voting approach to make a collective decision and take further action. In contrast to other intrusion detection system based on collective decision, MAPIDS saves more bandwidth and energy and it is immune to sparse nodes problem.","","0-7695-2405-2","","10.1109/PDCAT.2005.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1578953","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer science;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Voting","","","","1","","13","","","05-08 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given that these systems can roam on multiple networks, with no guarantee on security adopted on each network, including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the mobile platforms can be beneficial in preventing cyber-attacks. One of the key problems with implementing IDS on mobile platforms is the increased power consumption. This paper presents low power circuits that implement the string matching tasks within the Snort IDS. These tasks can take up to 80% of the power consumed for Snort. The circuit presented is based on memristor crossbars and evaluate Snort rules at 0.013mW per signature. The circuits are easy to program, utilizing only two resistance states for the memristors. They are highly parallel and dense, utilizing a brute-force string matching algorithm. These circuits could additionally be utilized for other string matching operations.","","978-1-4799-4690-7","","10.1109/NAECON.2014.7045811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045811","Deep packet inspection;Snort;intrusion detection system;memristor crossbars;network security;string matching","Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Inverters;Memristors;Mobile communication;Neurons;Pattern matching","memristor circuits;mobile computing;mobile handsets;power aware computing;security of data;string matching","IDS;Snort IDS;brute-force string matching algorithm;computing systems;cyber-attacks;memristor crossbars;mobile platforms;mobile systems;network intrusion detection system;power circuits;power consumption;power efficient architecture;string matching operations","","0","","12","","","24-27 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a framework for distributed detection of network intrusions based on a parametric model. The parametric model can explicitly reflect the distributions of different intrusion types and handle the mixed-attribute data naturally. Based on the model, we can generate an accurate global intrusion detector with a very low cost of communication among the distributed detection sites, and no sharing of original network data is needed. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework in the distributed intrusion detection application.","1062-922X","978-1-4244-2383-5","978-1-4244-2384-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4811596","Distributed detection;information security;machine learning","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Parametric statistics;Protection;Statistical analysis","data privacy;security of data","distributed architecture;information security system;mixed-attribute data;network intrusion detection;parametric model;privacy protection","","1","","29","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
