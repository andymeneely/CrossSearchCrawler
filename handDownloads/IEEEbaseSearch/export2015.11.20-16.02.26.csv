It seems to be more challenging of in wireless networks. Existing research carried out provides authentication, confidentiality, availability, secure routing and intrusion detection in ad hoc networks. Ad hoc network characteristics should be taken into consideration to design efficient data security along its path of transmission. The proposal of this work presented a Data Security Architecture (DSA) in improving the data transmission confidentiality in ad hoc networks based on multi-path routing. It utilizes the multiple paths between nodes in an ad hoc network to increase the confidentiality robustness of transmitted data. The original message to be secured is split into parts that are transmitted in multiple paths. The parted messages are encrypted on its course of transmission which improves the security to next level. Experimental simulations are conducted to the proposed DSA approach and compared with existing ad hoc multi-path security solutions, which show DSA perform better than existing security solution up to 6% to 8% improvement.","","978-1-61284-807-5","","10.1109/NCOIET.2011.5738821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738821","Data Security Architecture(DSA);Mobile ad hoc networks;security","Data security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;radio networks;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;multipath encrypted data security architecture;multipath routing;secure routing;wireless network","","0","","15","","","17-18 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, firstly, the advantages and disadvantages of the self detector set and the nonself detector set are briefly reviewed.

Conventional schemes place security devices (middleboxes) at a few choke points (e.g., core routers) and rely on routing policy to guarantee middlebox traversal. Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers. This paper explains the framework of HSA, describes the key techniques, presents a testbed to validate the design, and discusses future research directions.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364521","","Hardware;Middleboxes;Routing;Scalability;Security;Servers;Software","computer centres;computer network security;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","HSA;choke points;core routers;coupling routing;data center networks;guarantee middle box traversal;hybrid security architecture;multitenant data centers;place security devices;routing policy;security services;security system;software middleboxes;switches","","1","","18","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a game theory method to analyze the risk and impact of multi-stage attacks in IDS. In this method, the interactions between the attacker and the administrator are modeled as a non-cooperative zero-sum multistage game and it is modeled as a minmax game tree where the attacker is the leader and the administrator is the follower. Alternating the actions between the administrator and the attacker forms the game tree, each of them will be allowed to play a single action at any given time. In this work, a new multi-stage attacker defender (MAD) algorithm is developed to help the administrator in defending against multi-stage attacks. The believes of the attacker and the administrator are updated based on the analysis of the life-cycle for the multi-stage attacks to reduce the horizon effect.","","978-1-4244-3807-5","978-1-4244-3806-8","10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069450","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Network servers;Protection;Risk analysis;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;computer networks;game theory;minimax techniques;risk analysis;security of data;telecommunication security","communication complexity;computer network;game theory based risk analysis;impact analysis method;intrusion defense system;minmax game tree;multistage attack","","3","","7","","","10-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20070529","2007","","","116","124","This work investigates three aspects: (a) a network vulnerability as the non-uniform vulnerable-host distribution, (b) threats, i.e., intelligent worms that exploit such a vulnerability, and (c) defense, i.e., challenges for fighting the threats. We first study five data sets and observe consistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions. We then present a new metric, referred to as the non-uniformity factor, which quantifies the unevenness of a vulnerable-host distribution. This metric is essentially the Renyi information entropy and better characterizes the non-uniformity of a distribution than the Shannon entropy. We then analytically and empirically measure the infection rate and the propagation speed of network-aware worms. We show that a representative network-aware worm can increase the spreading speed by exactly or nearly a non-uniformity factor when compared to a random-scanning worm at the early stage of worm propagation. This implies that when a worm exploits an uneven vulnerable-host distribution as a network-wide vulnerability, the Internet can be infected much more rapidly. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of defense strategies on the spread of network-aware worms. Our results demonstrate that counteracting network-aware worms is a significant challenge for the strategies that include host-based defense and IPv6.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215604","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Computer worms;Distributed computing;Electric variables measurement;IP networks;Information entropy;Intelligent networks;Internet;Velocity measurement","Internet;entropy","Renyi information entropy;Shannon entropy;network vulnerability;network-aware worm spreading ability;vulnerable-host distribution","","17","","32","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we introduce an anomaly intrusion detection system, built on the notion of a DNA sequence or gene, which is responsible for the normal network traffic patterns. Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the “normal behavior DNA sequence” through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed. Finally, we provide the details of our FPGA implementation of the bioinformatics-based string matching technique. The associative string processor (ASP) is an associative memory-based micro-architecture with long fixed-length words that can be partially searched. We show that the proposed micro-architecture can handle fixed-length patterns at a rate of more than one character per cycle.","","978-1-4244-7716-6","","10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5586949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5586949","CAM;DNA computing;FPGA;Network Intrusion Detection;anomaly identification;bioinformatics;pattern matching","Artificial neural networks;DNA","biocomputing;computer network security;content-addressable storage;field programmable gate arrays;string matching","DNA based anomaly identification system;DNA pattern matching;DNA sequence;FPGA implementation;anomaly intrusion detection system;associative memory based microarchitecture;associative string processor;bioinformatics;genetic material;network traffic patterns;string matching","","0","","15","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time. Particularly, in mobile ad hoc networks one of very common attack is packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s). This paper developed an anomaly based fuzzy intrusion detection system to detect the packet dropping attack from mobile ad hoc networks and this proposed solution also save the resources of mobile nodes in respect to remove the malicious nodes. For implementation point of view, qualnet simulator 6.1 and sugeno-type fuzzy inference system are used to make the fuzzy rule base for analyzing the results.

The result was that, already in 1984, a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created by Siemens AG which remains state-of-the-art. Nevertheless, even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects.

This paper presents a brief survey of artificial intelligence applications in cyber defense (CD), and analyzes the prospects of enhancing the cyber defense capabilities by means of increasing the intelligence of the defense systems. After surveying the papers available about artificial intelligence applications in CD, we can conclude that useful applications already exist. They belong, first of all, to applications of artificial neural nets in perimeter defense and some other CD areas. From the other side - it has become obvious that many CD problems can be solved successfully only when methods of artificial intelligence are being used.

While this flexibility is a boon for embedded system developers, who can now rapidly prototype and deploy solutions with performance approaching custom designs, this results in a system development methodology where functionality is stitched together from a variety of ""soft IP cores,"" often provided by multiple vendors with different levels of trust. Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware. We propose an isolation primitive, moats and drawbridges, that are built around four design properties: logical isolation, interconnect traceability, secure reconfigurable broadcast, and configuration scrubbing. Each of these is a fundamental operation with easily understood formal properties, yet maps cleanly and efficiently to a wide variety of reconfigurable devices. We carefully quantify the required overheads on real FPGAs and demonstrate the utility of our methods by applying them to the practical problem of memory protection.","1081-6011","0-7695-2848-1","","10.1109/SP.2007.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223233","","Broadcasting;Control systems;Embedded system;Hardware;Operating systems;Prototypes;Resource management;Security;Silicon;Software prototyping","field programmable gate arrays;logic CAD;microprocessor chips;security of data","FPGAs;configuration scrubbing;custom designs;drawbridges;interconnect traceability;isolation primitive;moats;operating system;reconfigurable hardware based systems;secure reconfigurable broadcast;soft IP cores;system development methodology","","15","2","53","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas. The defenders can use the knowledge of such correlation between attack location and its impact to set higher security levels at particular positions by monitoring sensitive network parameters and detecting the anomalies.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2266399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525333","RPL;Rank attack;internal threat;performance;security","","Internet of Things;computer network security;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN routing protocol;Internet of Things;QoS parameters;RPL;ad hoc routing protocols;communication standard;control messages;control overhead;device management;energy saving performance;high forwarding load area;lossy networks;low-power networks;quality of service;rank concept;routing protocol network topology;security levels;wireless sensor network","","2","","7","","2013-06-06","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we dissect the behavior of a few household devices, specifically the Phillips Hue light-bulb, the Belkin WeMo power switch, and the Nest smoke-alarm, and highlight the ease with which security and privacy can be compromised. We then propose a new solution to protect such devices by restricting access at the network-level. Our solution does not require changes from device manufacturers, reduces burden on the end-users, and allows security to be offered as an overlay service by the ISP or from a specialist provider in the cloud.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997469","","Authentication;Bridges;Privacy;Protocols;Sensors;Servers","alarm systems;authorisation;data privacy;domestic appliances;home computing;mobile computing","Belkin WeMo power switch;Nest smoke-alarm;Phillips Hue light-bulb;privacy risk;security risk;smart household appliance","","0","","16","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have developed an automated tool called RACOON, which rapidly generates large amounts of user command data from a given template. We demonstrate that our technique can produce realistic data by showing that it passes several statistical similarity tests with real data.

DATMS adopts on-line analysis instead of post-mortem analysis to reduce the trace time. In addition, the packet filter controller which adapts to queue length is proposed to mitigate the DDoS attacks. Since it is extremely difficult to distinguish attack flows and victim flows on core routers, the proposed packet filter is very simple and has lower overhead.

Therefore choice of pattern matching algorithm is the critical to the performance of IDS and IPS. Several pattern matching algorithms exist in literature, but which pattern matching algorithm will give best performance for IDPS is not known at hand. So in this work four pattern matching algorithms namely Brute-force, RabinKarp, Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt has been selected for the analysis.

It additionally suggests that the evaluation of the policies themselves adapt to perceived network threat conditions, possibly affected by the receipt of such audit data by other processes. Such advanced policies assist in detecting and responding to intrusion and misuse and they allow more efficient utilization of security services, such as authentication, audit, and notification.

Extensive research activities have been aimed at network-based intrusion detection systems, but most of them are proved unsatisfactory. This paper presents an effective intrusion detection classification model based on projection pursuit. With maximizing a projection index, Projection Pursuit uses Genetic Algorithm to search for the optimal projection direction, projects network connections records from high-dimensional space into 1-dimensional space, and uses the projection values to analyze the data structure and classify the type of intrusion. This intrusion detection classification model not only cuts down the computing complexity in the process of network connection records, but also opens out non-linear structure not like in latent semantics analysis only discovering linear structure, and the results of classification can also be visualized. The results of the experiments on KDD CUP 1999 data show that this model not only has good performance, but also reduces the number of false alarms effectively.","","978-1-4577-1414-6","","10.1109/CECNet.2012.6201446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6201446","clustering;dimension reduction;intrusion detection;projection pursuit","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Testing;Training","computational complexity;computer network security;data structures;genetic algorithms;pattern classification","KDD CUP 1999 data;computational complexity;data structure;false alarms;genetic algorithm;high-dimensional space;intrusion detection classification model;latent semantics analysis;linear structure;network connections records;network security;network-based intrusion detection systems;nonlinear structure;one-dimensional space;optimal projection direction search;projection index maximization;projection pursuit","","0","","9","","","21-23 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To aim at a quick response in security operation, it is necessary to forecast a fluctuation of attacks. However, there is no approach for predicting the fluctuation of attacks, since the fluctuation of attacks seems to be random. In this paper, we propose forecast techniques for predicting increase or decrease of the attacks by using the Bayesian inference for calculating the conditional probability based on past-observed event counts. We consider two algorithms by focusing on an attack cycle and a fluctuation range of the event counts. We implement a forecasting system and evaluate it with real IDS events. As a result, our proposed technique can forecast increase or decrease of the event counts, and be effective to various types of attacks.","","0-7803-9195-0","","10.1109/PACRIM.2005.1517323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517323","","Bayesian methods","belief networks;computer networks;inference mechanisms;security of data","Bayesian inference;attacks fluctuation prediction;conditional probability;forecast techniques;intrusion detection system;past-observed event counts;security operation","","6","","5","","","24-26 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there is a weak anomaly detection problem among the existing system call based intrusion detection systems: the pattern value range of abnormal system call sequences generated by attacks always overlaps to that by normal behaviors so it is difficult to accurately classify the sequences falling into the overlap area by a unique threshold. Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.","","978-1-4799-2763-0","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743958","Intrusion Detection;Multi-module System;Top-k Prediction;Viterbi Algorithm","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","computer network security;pattern classification","TkVV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;abnormal system call sequences;computer networks;multimodule anomaly detection system;scalable linear algorithm;sequence classification;system call based intrusion detection systems;system protection;top-k future system call prediction;top-k prediction based multimodule;top-k variation","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with the traditional methods, the model designed here, which is totally insensitive to port numbers and contents of payload on application level, overcomes difficulty in operation caused by unreliable port numbers and complexity of payload interpretation. Rather than relatively complex ML algorithms or even in mixture, supervised k-Nearest Neighbor estimator is adopted for the sake of computational efficiency, along with the effective and easy-to-calculate statistical features selected according to the operational background.

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.","","978-0-7695-3716-0","","10.1109/FCCM.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944","FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance","","5","","19","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By allowing benchmarks to draw from a corpus of installable modules which can be based on actual security vulnerabilities, members of the security community can continuously maintain and improve the benchmark, allowing it to be updated as threats and defenses evolve. We developed a prototype of this testbed and determined that the testbed should automate several common web testing tasks on behalf of its modules in order to ease module development.

Consequently this paper advocates that for a range of WLAN infrastructure topographies (home, enterprise & open-access) there can be significant diversity in terms of resources, equipment, users and most importantly security, which can in turn influence attack detection performance. In order to demonstrate these detection differences, a novel framework for evaluating network security performance (the Threat-Victim Table) is developed. This framework is applied to a range of WLAN topographies using an open source (Kismet) Wireless Intrusion Detection System. Three Kismet components are utilised; client, server and drone, to represent typical IDS deployment configurations for these topographies. Analysis of the security capability of Kismet is derived as an example of this framework, for qualifying network security performance against security threats and also to assess the priority level of these vulnerabilities.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741636","802.11;Intrusion Detection Systems;Kismet;Network Security;WLAN","Computer crime;Encryption;Servers;Software;Surfaces;Wireless LAN","","","","0","","13","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This gives the lower bound for the energy required for data collection process, (b) instead of using a fixed network topology (communication tree), a set of optimized trees is constructed and the communication tree varies over different data collection cycles. We show that this method achieves an average energy consumption rate very close to the optimal value, (c) the packet exchange procedure is designed based on collision-free schedules, to minimize the number of packets and the transmission and reception times for each node.

In this paper, a novel string matching algorithm is proposed based on the idea of searching words in a dictionary. We have also presented a scalable, high throughput, memory efficient and modular architecture for large scale string matching based on the proposed algorithm. The words of dictionary have been extracted from malicious patterns of Snort NIDS (2013) database. The memory efficiency of the proposed algorithms is directly proportional to the dissimilarity of patterns. In a large dictionary, it is feasible to create several groups in such a way that the members of each group satisfy a desired condition. The presented architecture is designed for implementation on the Field Programmable Gate Array and profits from the pipeline, modular structure and suitable utilization of distributed memory resources. Due to the routing limitation of FPGAs, the maximum length of patterns has been limited and a further solution suggested for tackling this obstacle. The post place & route implementation results of a set of 11895 patterns (117832 Byte) with lengths within the range from 2 to 20 characters show an efficiency of 1.47 Byte/Char or 0.28 (6-input LUT/char) and a maximum throughput of 2.38 Gbps. Other results for a set of 3471 patterns (104399 Byte) with lengths within 21 and 40 characters show an efficiency of 1.87 Byte/Char or 0.42 (6-input LUT/char) and the maximum throughput of 1.97 Gbps.

Many solutions have been proposed to secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection systems with many different techniques such as data mining approaches are employed to maximize the detection rate of intrusions while reducing false alarm rate. For instance, many clustering techniques are recommended which segregate normal and abnormal data in IDSs. Clustering methods put emphasis on finding differences and similarities of traffic sessions to categorize each one in its corresponding groups. These groups are represented by their assigned labels. Later, these labels are used to predict the type of the incoming network traffic. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to use in intrusion detection systems, named CluSID. The major contribution of CluSID is using information theory for taking full advantages of clustering techniques. The main logic behind CluSID is to use non-uniform gain functions for network traffic features in order to improve the accuracy of clustering process. To this end, we apply information theory concepts for moving center of clusters to the most important areas in the domain of the selected features. The results clearly show a raise in detection rate of CluSID in most of the attack categories in comparison to KDD CUP'99 Winner and simple clustering methods. The increase in detection rate of proposed system is about 25 percent.","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635546","Clustering;Entropy;Information Theory;Intrusion Detecfion System","Clustering methods;Communication system security;Data mining;Data security;IP networks;Information security;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Logic;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data","Internet;clustering scheme;data mining;information theory;intrusion detection system;network traffic","","1","","19","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost.

However, new network applications demanding multimatch classification - that is, requiring all matching results instead of only the highest-priority match - are emerging. Ternary content-addressable memory is becoming a common extension to network processors, and its capability and speed make it attractive for high-speed networks. The proposed TCAM-based scheme produces multimatch classification results with about 10 times fewer memory lookups than a pure software approach. In addition, their scheme for removing negation in rule sets saves up to 95 percent of the TCAM space used by a straightforward implementation.","0272-1732","","","10.1109/MM.2005.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411716","","Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network address translation;Payloads;Probes;Protocols","content-addressable storage;packet switching;workstation clusters","high-speed networks;memory lookup;multimatch packet classification;network processors;ternary content-addressable memory","","21","","21","","","Jan.-Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Bitmap Algorithms for Counting Active Flows on High-Speed Links","Estan, C.; Varghese, G.; Fisk, M.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Wisconsin Univ., Madison, WI","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on","20061016","2006","14","5","925","937","This paper presents a family of bitmap algorithms that address the problem of counting the number of distinct header patterns (flows) seen on a high-speed link. Such counting can be used to detect DoS attacks and port scans and to solve measurement problems. Counting is especially hard when processing must be done within a packet arrival time (8 ns at OC-768 speeds) and, hence, may perform only a small number of accesses to limited, fast memory. A naive solution that maintains a hash table requires several megabytes because the number of flows can be above a million. By contrast, our new probabilistic algorithms use little memory and are fast. The reduction in memory is particularly important for applications that run multiple concurrent counting instances. For example, we replaced the port-scan detection component of the popular intrusion detection system Snort with one of our new algorithms. This reduced memory usage on a ten minute trace from 50 to 5.6 MB while maintaining a 99.77% probability of alarming on a scan within 6 s of when the large-memory algorithm would. The best known prior algorithm (probabilistic counting) takes four times more memory on port scan detection and eight times more on a measurement application. This is possible because our algorithms can be customized to take advantage of special features such as a large number of instances that have very small counts or prior knowledge of the likely range of the count","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2006.882836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709947","Counting distinct elements;traffic measurements","Computer crime;Computer science;Counting circuits;Hardware;Intrusion detection;NIST;Quality of service;Random access memory;Registers;Spine","Internet;probability;telecommunication links;telecommunication security","DoS attacks;Internet links;bitmap algorithms;high-speed links;intrusion detection system;packet arrival time;port-scan detection component;probabilistic algorithms;probabilistic counting","","31","","22","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For the DSNSF creation a modification of Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic is used, which improves the extraction of information, defining a normal profile. Furthermore, we propose a model based on DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) pattern matching technique for anomaly detecting, allowing the recognition of deviant behavior moving in time and those who are punctual. The anomaly notifications are multilevel, in order not to overload the network administrator with false reports. To evaluate the proposed system, IP flows from a real data set were used.","","","","10.1109/SoftCOM.2013.6671906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671906","","","IP networks;ant colony optimisation;computer network reliability;computer network security;digital signatures;pattern matching;telecommunication traffic","DSNSF;DTW pattern matching technique;IP flow;anomaly detection;ant colony optimization metaheuristic modification;deviant behavior recognition;digital signature of network segment using flow analysis;dynamic time warping pattern matching technique;information extraction;network availability;network traffic monitoring","","0","","14","","","18-20 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite security issues delaying its adoption, cloud computing has already become an unstoppable force; thus, security mechanisms to ensure its secure adoption are an immediate need. Here, we focus on intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) to defend against the intruders. In this paper, we propose a Distributed, Collaborative, and Data-driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (DCDIDP). Its goal is to make use of the resources in the cloud and provide a holistic IDPS for all cloud service providers which collaborate with other peers in a distributed manner at different architectural levels to respond to attacks. We present the DCDIDP framework, whose infrastructure level is composed of three logical layers: network, host, and global as well as platform and software levels. Then, we review its components and discuss some existing approaches to be used for the modules in our proposed framework. Furthermore, we discuss developing a comprehensive trust management framework to support the establishment and evolution of trust among different cloud service providers.","","978-1-4673-0683-6","978-1-936968-32-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144819","Cloud computing;collaborative IDPS;distributed IDPS;intrusion detection","Computational modeling;Indium tin oxide;Load modeling;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;security of data","architectural levels;cloud computing environments;cloud service providers;distributed collaborative and data-driven intrusion detection;global layer;host layer;infrastructure level;intrusion detection and prevention systems;logical layers;network layer;platform levels;security mechanisms;software levels","","2","","28","","","15-18 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These problems lead to defense systems requiring various detection methods in order to identify attacks. Moreover, DDoS attacks can mix their traffics during flash crowds. By doing this, the complex defense system cannot detect the attack traffic in time. In this paper, we propose a behavior based detection that can discriminate DDoS attack traffic from traffic generated by real users. By using Pearson's correlation coefficient, our comparable detection methods can extract the repeatable features of the packet arrivals. The extensive simulations were tested for the accuracy of detection. We then performed experiments with several datasets and our results affirm that the proposed method can differentiate traffic of an attack source from legitimate traffic with a quick response. We also discuss approaches to improve our proposed methods at the conclusion of this paper.","","978-1-4577-0249-5","978-1-4577-0248-8","10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928950","DDoS attacks;anomaly detection;correlation coefficient;traffic patterns","Computer crime;Correlation;Delay;IP networks;Internet;Mathematical model;Servers","computer network security;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack traffic discrimination;Pearson correlation coefficient;botnets;flash crowd;packet arrival patterns;packet transmission strategies;worms","","2","","17","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, it relies on computer and network to maintain it operation. Due to the characteristics of network, person with intention to commit crime can conduct criminal behavior by linking with the network at any time and at any place. If there is no appropriate control on the information asset, information can be easily altered or deleted and even important information may be disclosed thereby generating serious loss. As the business of the finance industry includes the personal and transaction information of customer, therefore the requirement on information security has to be more stringent than other industry. Moreover, for the consideration on information security, generally this is conducted based on the angle of technology, but other factors are ignored. In fact, information security has three aspects including technology, management and policy. This thesis will provide suggestion on the overall information security protection on the information environment of the finance industry. Furthermore, study is conducted on the information regulation/industry standard and flow planning that can be used to provide an overall information security solution plan that is safe and efficient.","2154-0357","978-1-4244-6873-7","","10.1109/EIT.2010.5612142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5612142","","Computers;Encryption;Fires;Industries;Information security;Information technology","business data processing;financial data processing;information management;security of data","business information;finance industry;flow planning;information management;information security environment;personal information;protection transaction information","","0","","13","","","20-22 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
