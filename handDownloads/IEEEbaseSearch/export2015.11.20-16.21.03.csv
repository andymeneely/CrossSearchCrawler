In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates. In this paper, we will outline the security concerns that misbehaviour poses in terms of both individual components and the SoS as a whole. We will also propose our novel monitoring framework, which is designed to overcome the challenges of monitoring in a SoS environment. This paper also details our implementation and presents some of our initial results.","","","","10.1109/CRiSIS.2013.6766347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766347","misbehaviour;monitoring;system-of-systems","Aerodynamics;Collaboration;Measurement;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Real-time systems;Security","security of data;system monitoring;systems engineering","SoS environment;collaborative environment;component misbehaviour monitoring;component system behaviour unpredictability;dynamic component system behaviour;environment heterogeneity;security threats;system-of-system components","","0","","23","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These packet inspections typically require considerable delay often consuming more than 70% of the IDS processing time. Unfortunately, this delay becomes more significant as security policies and network speeds continue to increase. This paper introduces a new parallel IDS content matching technique that provides initial packet inspections with less delay. The technique distributes portions of a packet payload across an array of n processors, each responsible for scanning a smaller amount of original payload. Given this design, each processor has less data to inspect thus reducing the overall delay. Unlike similar parallel approaches, our technique ensures that security is maintained (no false negatives). Furthermore, the proposed parallel technique is shown to result in an initial match speed-up of approximately 1.25n using Snort (an open source IDS), actual IDS policies, and traffic traces - a significant improvement over current parallel techniques.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4454922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454922","Aho-Corasick;Data Parallel;Intrusion Detection;Packet;Parallel;Signature Matching;Snort;Wu-Manber","Automata;Computer science;Data security;Delay effects;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Next generation networking;Payloads;Process design","","","","2","","14","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Processing these data stream generated by the IoT networks with different patterns has raised new challenges for the real-time performance of intrusion detection system (IDS) in IoT environments, which has to react quickly to the hacking attacks and malicious activities to IoT. In recent years, Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology provides new solutions in the field of complex pattern identifications and real-time data processing, which can be used to improve the performance of traditional IDS in IoT environments. IDS integrated with CEP can be used to deal with patterns among events and process large volumes of messages with low latency.

There are more nodes, the traffic has increased, and there are frequent requests that imply modifications to the underlying infrastructure. Some examples of these requirements are cloud computing, virtualized environments, and data centers. SDN has been developed to address some of these issues. By separating control and data planes, SDN enables the programming of the control plane and the dynamic reconfiguration of the data plane thus making it possible to automatize some tasks. SDN makes it possible to dynamically reconfigure a network as a response to a security event. This work studies the advantages and disadvantages of the platform for programming a network to react to security events. The number of security events that may happen in a network is considerable, therefore, we defined an architecture that may be used in different cases and implemented it to evaluate the behavior for two types of events: DoS attacks and intrusions. The platform offers several tools for programming and testing, but they are still in development. In fact, we found a problem with one tool and some inconveniences with others which we reported to the development team. The participation of the community by debugging and finding ways to improve the platform is key to SDN's development.","","978-1-4799-4342-5","","10.1109/ColComCon.2014.6860412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6860412","","Control systems;Hardware;IP networks;Monitoring;Programming;Security;Software","computer debugging;computer network security","DoS attacks;SDN development;automatic network reconfiguration;debugging;intrusion detection;security events;software defined networks","","0","","10","","","4-6 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, clustering analyses are insufficient to establish overall patterns, sequential dependencies and precise classifications of attacks embedded in of low level alerts. This is because there are several ways to cluster a set of alerts especially if the alerts contain clustering criteria that have several values. Consequently, it is difficult to promptly select an appropriate clustering technique for investigating computer attacks and to concurrently handle the tradeoffs between interpretations and clustering of low level alerts effectively. Accordingly, alerts, attacks and corresponding countermeasures are frequently mismatched. Hence, several realistic attacks easily circumvent early detections. Therefore, in this paper, intrusive alerts were clustered and the quality of each cluster was evaluated. The results demonstrate how a measure of entropy can be used to establish suitable clustering technique for investigating computer attacks.","","978-1-4244-9029-5","","10.1109/CEEC.2010.5606495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5606495","Clustering criteria;Entropy;Intrusion detectors;bad clusters;clustering good clusters","Algorithm design and analysis;Detectors;Entropy;Forensics;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protocols","computer forensics;computer network security;pattern classification;pattern clustering","clustering criteria;computer attack investigation;intrusive alerts;network forensics;network intrusion detectors;optimised clustering method","","1","","16","","","8-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without proper security measures, an enemy can launch various kinds of attacks in hostile environments. These attacks can disrupt the normal working of WSNs and can defeat the purpose of their deployment. Therefore security is an important aspect of these networks. Preventive mechanisms can be applied to protect WSNs against some types of attacks. However, there are some attacks for which there are no known prevention methods.

Allowing white spaces to be used in a deregulated manner exposes the radio spectrum to anomalous usage, which in turn may intentionally or unintentionally cause interference to primary users (PUs) as well as secondary users (SUs). In this paper we propose a subspace-based spectrum guarding detector (SSGD) to address the security of unauthorized spectrum usage. In particular, we consider the scenario where ongoing authorized transmissions by PUs have to be preserved from concurrent unauthorized emissions in the same frequency bands. The detector operates in two phases: a training phase where SSGD collects samples of the authorized transmissions, and a detection (on-line) phase where the spectrum is guarded against anomalous emissions. The performance of SSGD is analyzed in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities highlighting the effects of the propagation scenario, the PU characteristics, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the duration of both training and on-line phases. Numerical results show that in practical scenarios SSGD provides a remarkable SNR improvement of several dB over the conventional energy detector (ED).","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247214","","Cognitive radio;Covariance matrices;Detectors;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Signal to noise ratio;Training","cognitive radio;error statistics;next generation networks;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","PU;SNR improvement;SSGD;anomalous emission;authorized transmission;cognitive radio;concurrent unauthorized emission;dynamic spectrum access;energy detector;false alarm probability;next generation wireless network;phase detection;primary user;secondary user;signal-to-noise ratio;spectrum efficiency;subspace-based spectrum guarding detector;training phase;unauthorized spectrum usage security;white space","","","","","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

System call monitoring has been touted as an effective defense against control hijacking attacks because it could prevent remote attackers from inflicting damage upon a victim system even if they can successfully compromise certain applications running on the system. However, the Achilles' heel of the system call monitoring approach is the construction of accurate system call behavior model that minimizes false positives and negatives. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a program semantics-aware intrusion detection system called Paid, which automatically derives an application-specific system call behavior model from the application's source code, and checks the application's run-time system call pattern against this model to thwart any control hijacking attacks. Experiments on a fully working Paid prototype show that Paid can indeed stop attacks that exploit non-standard security holes, such as format string attacks that modify function pointers, and that the run-time latency and throughput penalty of Paid are under 11.66% and 10.44%, respectively, for a set of production-mode network server applications including Apache, Sendmail, Ftp daemon, etc","","0-7803-9393-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605766","","Automatic control;Computer security;Control systems;Delay;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Prototypes;Remote monitoring;Runtime;Throughput","Internet;security of data;source coding;telecommunication security","accurate application-specific sandboxing policy;cybersecurity threats;hijacking attacks;production-mode network server;program semantics-aware intrusion detection system;source code;system call monitoring","","0","","24","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Differences in pixel intensity are calculated and compared with a fuzzy rule base to calculate edginess. This edginess measure is used to decide whether a pixel belongs to an edge or not. Features extracted from training videos train the Naive Bayesian Classifier which is then used for testing videos. Features are pre-processed using techniques such as Discretize, Fuzzy Logic, Numeric to Binary, PKI Discretize and Normalize. Then, they are filtered using Correlation Feature Selection before training the classifier.

Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks","","11","","42","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this way, the IDS itself will depress overall performance and cannot be guaranteed secure. In this paper, we present an embedded architecture of SPMOS-based IDS. SPMOS, located in SPM, is a little OS running under GPOS. Experiment results show that the architecture is fast. Based on this, we also design a simple IDS and conduct tests by integrating it into SPMOS and GPOS.

The underlying idea is to incorporate trust evaluation in the routing protocol, considering not only quality-of-service (QoS) trust properties (connectivity) but also social trust properties (honesty and unselfishness) to evaluate other nodes encountered. Two versions of trust management protocols are considered: an equal-weight QoS and social trust management protocol (called trust-based routing) and a QoS only trust management protocol (called connectivity-based routing). By utilizing a stochastic Petri net model describing a DTN behavior, we analyze the performance characteristics of these two routing protocols in terms of message delivery ratio, latency, and message overhead. We also perform a comparative performance analysis with epidemic routing for a DTN consisting of heterogeneous mobile nodes with vastly different social and networking behaviors. The results indicate that trust-based routing approaches the ideal performance of epidemic routing in delivery ratio, while connectivity-based routing approaches the ideal performance in message delay of epidemic routing, especially as the percentage of selfish and malicious nodes present in the DTN system increases. By properly selecting weights associated with QoS and social trust metrics for trust evaluation, our trust management protocols can approximate the ideal performance obtainable by epidemic routing in delivery ratio and message delay without incurring high message overhead.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683235","","Delay;Mathematical model;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Routing;Routing protocols","Petri nets;computer network security;mobile radio;quality of service;routing protocols;stochastic processes","DTN;QoS;connectivity-based routing;delay tolerant networks;encounter-based routing;epidemic routing;heterogeneous mobile node;message delivery ratio;quality of service;routing protocol;stochastic Petri net model;trust management protocol","","21","","15","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

This can be used to verify the result of the intrusion attempt. We then extend this method to verify the result of attacks that still generate valid protocol status code in the server responses.

However, IDS must be distributed to work in a grid computing environment. It must monitor each node and, when an attack occurs, alert other nodes in the environment. This kind of communication requires compatibility between heterogeneous hosts, various communication mechanisms, and permission control over system maintenance and updates.

Traditional processors are not keeping up with the performance demands, whereas specialized hardware will never be able to compete with commodity hardware in terms of cost effectiveness, reusability and ease of programming. Advanced multi-core architectures like the IBM Cell Broadband Engine promise unprecedented performance at a low cost, thanks to their popularity and production volume. Nevertheless, the suitability of the cell processor to string matching has not been investigated so far. In this paper we investigate the performance attainable by the cell processor when employed for string matching algorithms based on deterministic finite-state automata (DFA). Our findings show that the cell is an ideal candidate to tackle modern security needs: two processing elements alone, out of the eight available on one cell processor provide sufficient computational power to filter a network link with bit rates in excess of 10 Gbps.","","1-4244-0910-1","1-4244-0910-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228362","","Automata;Computer networks;Costs;Data security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Production","cellular automata;deterministic automata;finite state machines;security of data;string matching","IBM Cell Broadband Engine;cell processor;deterministic finite-state automata;intrusion detection system;multicore architecture;string matching","","12","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In iOSDC, every OSD is intelligent, called intelligent OSD (iOSD) and all the objects are intelligent, called intelligent OBJECT (iOBJECT). Methods, rules, trigger and feed back mechanism are introduced into object defined in OSD-2 draft, so an object is comprised of data, attributes, methods, rules, trigger and feedback mechanism. After the relationship among these six components is built up, the object is no longer passive, but active. Furthermore, some specific objects are introduced into OSDs, these specific objects can enhance the intelligence of OSD. Collaboration of all the iOSDs gives birth to the intelligent OSD Cluster.

"PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters","Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on","20090127","2008","","","73","80","PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.","","978-1-4244-3783-2","978-1-4244-2796-3","10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368","","Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic","computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases","Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler","","2","","22","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sink node in WSN that maintains the database of entire network is also prone to security violations and there is no such security mechanism devised for communicating the data to other nodes. Hence, there is a need to design security scheme with the capabilities to protect the network and the sink node on the occurrence of attack. In this paper, we aim to provide security with a reactive security scheme that includes studying the behavioral aspect of attacks and congregating the security demands. This scheme successively conglomerates the security and the network rescue mechanism free from attacks and their impacts on the network.

As a smart spectrum sharing technology, cognitive radio can change its transmitter parameter based on interactive the environment where it operates. So the MAC address can be easy spoofed in the open air. An attacker can exploit this character to preempt spectrum resources and bring the negative impact to the network. In this paper, we propose a scheme of detecting identity-spoof attack based on Back Propagation (BP) network. The scheme extracts the fingerprint feature of cognitive user to get the received signal strength (RSS). The extracted Eigen values can be used as the input vectors of the BP neural network which are trained by the honest users' RSS. The honest users and the attackers can be divided into two categories by the trained BP network to detect an identity-spoof attack. Simulation result shows that our scheme can effectively detect identity-spoof attack with a low false alarm rate and miss alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-9792-8","","10.1109/CSQRWC.2011.6037280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6037280","BP neural network;cognitive radio network;identity-spoof attack detection","Jamming","access protocols;backpropagation;cognitive radio;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature extraction;neural nets;spectral analysis;telecommunication security","BP network;MAC address;backpropagation network;cognitive radio network;cognitive user;cognitive user opportunistic access;eigen value extraction;fingerprint feature extraction;identity spoof attack detection;miss alarm rate;parameter transmitter;received signal strength;smart spectrum sharing technology;spectrum resource;spectrum utilization","","1","","11","","","26-30 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many application cases it is sufficient to provide message authentication at the sink. To implement this requirement using symmetric ciphers, keys shared between each sensor node and the sink have to be established and kept fresh during network operation. This paper presents a key distribution scheme based on the well known elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism that allows us to fulfil the previously outlined requirements efficiently. The DHB-KEY scheme requires only the distribution of a single sink-initiated broadcast message to set individual keys on all sensor nodes. Thus, DHB-KEY has a low complexity and preserves scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy. In the paper we present a protocol specification based on the DHB-KEY scheme and its implementation for the well known TinyOS platform. A physical intrusion detection system in an office building is used to evaluate the protocol implementation. The evaluation shows that DHB-KEY is practical in real-world deployments.","","978-1-4244-2574-7","978-1-4244-2575-4","10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4660127","","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Mechanical factors;Message authentication;Protocols;Public key cryptography;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","computational complexity;message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TinyOS platform;communication security;elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism;intrusion detection system;key distribution scheme;message authentication;single sink-initiated broadcast message;symmetric ciphers;wireless sensor networks","","5","","17","","","Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an approach of security gateway to effectively detect the security threats or illegal access attempts to IPv6 WLAN. By taking the advantages of wireless technology for mobility as well as IPv6 features, the security gateway is capable of offering precautionary reports for potential intrusions, attacks, or system vulnerabilities before a global IP being determined. The gateway is composed of traffic collection unit, traffic processing unit, behavior analysis unit, response unit, authentication unit, and policy management unit. With monitoring and analyzing the communication traffic from the managed devices, using the widely available tools from SNMP, ICMP, DHCP, and RADIUS, the security gateway provides an elegant solution to filter most illegal accesses to wireless IPv6 networks","","0-7695-2613-6","","10.1109/ICIS-COMSAR.2006.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1651974","IPv6;Network Management;Security Gateway;WLAN","Access protocols;Authentication;Communication standards;Communication system security;Computer science;Information security;National security;Network servers;Routing;Wireless LAN","IP networks;internetworking;message authentication;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","DHCP;ICMP;IETF standards;IPsec authentication header;IPv6 WLAN illegal access;RADIUS;SNMP;authentication unit;automatic key management;behavior analysis unit;communication traffic monitoring;policy management unit;response unit;security gateway;traffic collection unit;traffic processing unit","","0","","27","","","10-12 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these distributed sensors rely on propagation of signals along continuous metallic conductors and interpretation of signal changes representative of an intrusion. These sensors may operate on widely different electrical phenomenologies to provide their guided means of detection and communication of the detected events. This paper provides a survey of these different sensor detection methods, and unlike past or companion papers, which focus on a specific detection technology, looks at the application from the cable viewpoint outward. This review is believed to be of interest to both sensor users and developers as it cuts across the array of sensor technologies from a different physical viewpoint. This review starts from ""no conductor"" optical cables, progresses through single conductors, and moves on to multi conductor cables. The primary focus is on dual conductor, metallic sensor cables, since they are the most prevalent. The different principles of detection, and their application to security sensors is addressed. This paper further addresses the elements of sensor cable design, manufacturing, installation and use, with specific intrusion detection sensor examples for illustration.","","978-1-4244-1129-0","","10.1109/CCST.2007.4373484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4373484","Perimeter security sensor;buried line sensor;fence sensor;fiber optic sensor;leaky coaxial cable sensor;microphonic triboelectric fence detection sensor;outdoor intrusion detection system","Conductors;Intrusion detection;Optical fiber cables;Optical fiber polarization;Optical fiber sensors;Optical sensors;Security;Sensor arrays;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems","coaxial cables;fibre optic sensors;safety systems;security","buried line sensor;conductive sensor cables;dual conductor;fence sensor;fiber optic sensor;leaky coaxial cable sensor;metallic conductors;microphonic triboelectric fence detection sensor;multi conductor cables;outdoor intrusion detection system;perimeter intrusion detection;security sensors","","1","","10","","","8-11 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ANODR is a purely on demand routing and identity free routing scheme that sets up an anonymous route as needed in real time. The proposed protocol ensures node privacy, route anonymity and location privacy and is robust against several known attacks. This limits the chances of eavesdropping and traffic analyzing to a time-critical on-demand window. Anonymity is one of the important characteristics in securing a wireless ad hoc network routing. In this paper we study the unique anonymity threats in wireless ad hoc environments. Two design principles of anonymous routing - anonymous route discovery and anonymous data forwarding are presented here. In the anonymous route discovery design, a random route pseudonym for an on demand route is established. In the anonymous data forwarding design, the source wraps its data packets for each end to end connection. This was implemented and tested using NS-2.0 simulator. The behavior of the proposed system has been studied for analysis like packet delivery ratio, packet delay and overhead along with the existing system.","","978-1-4244-3594-4","978-1-4244-3595-1","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787692","","Communication system security;Design engineering;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Privacy;Protection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","ANODR;NS-2.0 simulator;anomaly detection;anonymous data forwarding;anonymous on demand routing protocol;anonymous route discovery;black hole;route disrupt attacks;time-critical on-demand window;wireless ad hoc network routing","","0","","16","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed. An approach inspired by the functionalities and characteristics of natural immune system is presented and discussed in the paper.

In the literature, watchdog model was proposed to detect network related attacks. However, this technique relies on routing level monitoring, which suffers from high false positives due to channel collision. As a solution to improve the watchdog detection, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection system based on cross layer architecture, that correlates both MAC and network layers detections. This is achieved by (1) monitoring the number of RTS/CTS (request to send/clear to send) requests of the watchdogs and the detected nodes at the MAC layer; and (2) recalculating watchdogs detection percentage after aggregating the results with MAC monitors. Cooperative monitoring in both network and MAC levels helps recognize the presence of channel collision and hence, reduces the false alarm rate. Simulation results corroborate that the use of cooperative cross layer design improves the detection percentage and minimizes the false positive rate.","","978-1-4799-7324-8","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906469","Cooperative;VANETs;cross layer;packet forward","Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","access protocols;cooperative communication;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","MAC monitors;MPR;RTS-CTS;VANET-OLSR;blackhole attack detection;channel collision;clear to send;cooperative cross layer detection;cooperative intrusion detection;cooperative monitoring;cross layer architecture;false alarm rate;multipoint relays;network layers detections;request to send;routing level monitoring;secure optimized link state routing protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;watchdog detection","","0","","19","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, using open source web applications is a double-edged sword in that it supplies both attackers and defenders more control over their security aspect. Well-known attacks are aimed access resources that are not referenced by the web application and lead to information discloser. Inspired by the idea of a sniper lurking in the shadows of civilization as a secret guard, this paper proposes a framework-named Sniper-to improve the security of open source web applications. Mimicking a real sniper who hides in the bushes to watch and eliminate dangerous enemies, the proposed Sniper framework is hidden within the web application to capture potential attackers. To illustrate further, if an attacker approaches your website seeking sensitive data, Sniper will be there watching to detect the intrusion, notify the webmaster anonymously, and block the attacker based on predefined thresholds. Therefore, Sniper identifies and mitigates attack attempts ahead of time by monitoring suspicious traffic intended to reach forbidden or sensitive areas. Sniper was implemented and tested using three different open source web applications. As a webmaster, I cannot imagine a better lights-out monitoring solution that not only notifies me, but also blocks potentially malicious access.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051949","","Electronic mail;Monitoring;Security;Testing;Web servers;Web sites","Web sites;computer crime;public domain software","Sniper framework;Webmasters;attack attempts detection;attackers;business Websites;intrusion detection;malicious access;official Websites;open source Web applications;personal Websites;security aspect;sensitive data;social network Websites;suspicious traffic monitoring","","0","","26","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its "" backbone"" in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48.

A project is underway that has identified six so-called SAREPH characteristics of adversarial self-organizing agility, and is now cataloging patterns toward a pattern language of self-organizing security techniques thatcan be employed for equal or superior security agility. Many such patterns have recently been developed. This paper adds the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to the catalog. The essence of a GA is to express the problem to be optimized in terms of a ""fitness function"" that evaluates how well candidates optimize the solution. In natural evolution fitness is an organism's ability to survive and reproduce. Computing applications abstract fitness to match the problem at hand, such as an Intrusion Detection System attempting to correlate seemingly unrelated events that collectively constitute a threat Reviewed first are the pattern project and the general nature of the GA. A reusable generic pattern description is developed. Howthe pattern conforms to the SAREPH characteristics is shown. Then three examples from the literature show howthe pattern is employed in SAREPH conformity: predator-prey behavior evolution in robotswarms, future behavior prediction in financially traded stocks, and attack detection in an Intrusion Detection System.","1071-6572","978-1-4673-2450-2","978-1-4673-2449-6","10.1109/CCST.2012.6393577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393577","Intrusion detection;SAREPH","Context;Filtering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Graphics;Qualifications;Robots;Security","genetic algorithms;security of data","SAREPH characteristics;attack detection;financially traded stock prediction;fitness function;genetic algorithm pattern;intrusion detection system;pattern language;predator-prey behavior evolution;reusable generic pattern description;robot swarms;self-organizing agile security techniques","","1","","16","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transmittance contrast between x- and y-polarized modes reaches 31.9 dB, which is sensitive enough to monitor any polarization state change in the fiber.

With mounting global network connectivity, the issue of intrusion has achieved importance, promoting active research on efficient Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a new bio-inspired model which is applied for solving various problems in the field of information security. The unique features AIS encourage the researchers to employ this techniques in variety of applications and especially in intrusion detection systems. Proper IDS design is essential to improve the performance of the IDS. The centralized design of this IDS has disadvantage of central processing for massive processes for each packets passing trough network. In this paper we proposed a distributed multi-layerd framework to enhance the detection performance and efficiency of this IDS. In our design the genetic algorithm is used for enhancing the secondary immune response. The fundamental design of our proposed AIS based IDS consists of 2 main components: IDS central engine and detection sensors. Each of these components is composed of some agents which correlate with each other in order to detect the anomalies and intrusions. Our design goal is to decrease the detection time for each connection by distributing the detectors to each host.","","978-1-4244-8599-4","978-89-88678-32-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5713478","AIS;Agent;Danger Theory;Distributed;IDS","Artificial immune systems;Detectors;Engines;Intrusion detection;Training","artificial immune systems;computer network security;distributed processing;genetic algorithms","AIS;IDS;anomalies detection;artificial immune system;bio-inspired model;distributed model;genetic algorithm;information security;intrusion detection system;network security","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such evidence can be useful for designing efficient countermeasures that will thwart multiple attacks in progress. However, some intruders may take total control of computer networks over time while others may decide to partially compromise certain segments of their targets. Consequently, most intrusion analysts often find it difficult to establish hidden correlations between these two categories of probes and their associated objectives. This paper uses time series analysis to reconstruct workloads using baselines in the range of t<sub>1</sub> = 1s to t<sub>60</sub> = 60s for each intrusion log. Comparisons of the results obtained across different range of datasets demonstrate that alerts triggered by Snort can be used to reconstruct admissible evidence for litigation purposes. The results also reveal the variability of workloads within predefined intervals and the extent that alerts from different intrusion logs resemble each other.","","978-1-4673-1366-7","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205453","Intrusion Detection System;intrusion;intrusion analyst.;patterns of attacks;time series analysis","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computers;Forensics;Intrusion detection;Time series analysis","computer network security","associated objectives;computer crime reconstruction;computer networks;concurrent forecasting;forecasting alerts workload;forensic model;hidden correlations;intrusion detectors;intrusion pattern","","0","","17","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to make a WMN be all it can be, considerable research efforts are still needed. As the available MAC and routing protocols applied to WMNs do not have enough scalability as throughput drops significantly as the number of nodes or hops increases. Existing security schemes may be effective for certain types of attacks, but they lack a comprehensive mechanism to prevent attacks from different protocol layers. Similar problems exist in other networking protocols. Thus, existing communication protocols, ranging from routing, MAC, and physical layers, need to be revisited and enhanced. In some circumstances, new protocols need to be invented. Researchers have started to revisit the protocol design of existing wireless networks.

However, the traditional design approaches pay more attention on the implementation methods as well as their efficiency than the power consumption. In this paper we provide a power efficient regular expression matching architecture (PeRex). By taking full use of both rising and trailing edges of the system clocks such architecture is able to match two characters in a single system cycle. So, by maintaining the high performance and throughput the architecture in this paper is able to work in a lower clock frequency, consequently it will decrease the dynamic power consumption remarkably.

Anomalous requests are processed by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The intrusion response component is the major responsible component in IDS for anomalous requests processing. Response component manages some of the policy for authenticating the user requests for further access. The system is proposed with the Database Response Policies with two issues Policy Matching and Policy Administration. This system is termed as Joint Threshold Administrative Module (JTAM). The principle used in JTAM is Separation of Duty. The major idea is used to prevent the malicious modification of the policies by database administrators (DBA's). The database modification proposed ought to be signed by k DBA's for complete modified policy. Cryptographic algorithms are used to encrypt the policy and the signatures. The policies are limited for the user's view and for this `pattern concept' is used. An Intrusion Prevention Protocol (IPP) is proposed which detects the users that attacks the system and revokes the access rights of that user.","","","978-1-84919-797-7","10.1049/cp.2012.2255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6719161","Cryptographic Algorithm;Intrusion Detection;Policy;Protocol;Response;Separation of Duty;Threshold signature","","cryptographic protocols;relational databases","DBA;IDS;IPP;JTAM;cryptographic algorithms;database administrators;database community;database hacking;database response policies;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention protocol;intrusion response component;joint threshold administrative module;policy administration;policy matching;preventive approach;relational databases;response patterns","","0","","","","","27-29 Dec. 2012","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

These environments are very useful to react to intrusions or to analyze security problem because they provide a global view of the network without adding any kinds of software on network components. They therefore lack the possibility to have a real-time metric which measures the security health of the different sites. The idea is to have, in one look, an indication of the security level of all the sites of the network. In this article, we propose to define such a metric which gives the user 3 states for a given network.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-1693-6","978-1-4244-1694-3","10.1109/IPDPS.2008.4536562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4536562","","Capacitive sensors;Commercialization;Data analysis;Data security;Databases;Decision making;Engines;Information security;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis","security of data","centralized security operation center;multisites networks;real-time security level evaluation","","1","","10","","","14-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, many real-world scenarios require a classification decision well before a flow has finished even if the flow's beginning is lost. This implies classification must be achieved using statistics derived from the most recent N packets taken at any arbitrary point in a flow's lifetime. We propose training the classifier on a combination of short sub-flows (extracted from full-flow examples of the target application's traffic). We demonstrate this optimisation using the naive Bayes ML algorithm, and show that our approach results in excellent performance even when classification is initiated mid-way through a flow with windows as small as 25 packets long. We suggest future use of unsupervised ML algorithms to identify optimal sub-flows for training","0742-1303","1-4244-0418-5","1-4244-0419-3","10.1109/LCN.2006.322122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4116573","","Government;IP networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","IP network;IP traffic;machine learning classifier;naive Bayes algorithm","","32","1","26","","","14-16 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SGS carries out the intrusion rule extraction of data packets which have entered Honeyd and compares these rules with the rule library in the Snort. If there exist no similar intrusion rules in the rule library, SGS will automatically create a new rule. Otherwise SGS will update the rule. In this way it automatically updates the rule library of Snort to reduce the miss probability of Snort.","","978-1-4244-9110-0","978-0-7695-4287-4","10.1109/PDCAT.2010.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5704465","Attack signature;Honeyd;Honeypot;Intrusion detection","Computers;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Servers","Internet;public domain software;security of data","SGS;attack signature generation;data packets;intrusion rule extraction;open source software;signature generation system;virtual honeypots","","0","","12","","","8-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many machine learning methods have also been introduced by researcher recently to obtain high accuracy and detection rate. Unfortunately, a potential drawback of all those methods is the rate of false alarm. However, our proposed approach shows better results, by combining clustering (to identify groups of similarly behaved samples, i.e. malicious and non-malicious activity) and classification techniques (to classify all data into correct class categories). The approach, KM+1R, combines the k-means clustering with the OneR classification technique. The KDD Cup '99 set is used as a simulation dataset. The result shows that our proposed approach achieve a better accuracy and detection rate, particularly in reducing the false alarm.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122818","Classification;Clustering;Intrusion Detection System;Machine Learning","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Probes;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data","IDS;KM+1R;OneR classification;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;machine learning methods","","5","","35","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These attacks are more difficult to detect than the flooding DDoS attacks. This paper explores the energy distributions of Internet traffic flows in frequency domain. Normal TCP traffic flows present periodicity because of protocol behavior. Our results reveal that normal TCP flows can be segregated from malicious flows according to energy distribution properties. We discover the spectral shifting of attack flows from that of normal flows. Combining flow-level spectral analysis with sequential hypothesis testing, we propose a novel defense scheme against RoQ attacks. Our detection and filtering scheme can effectively rescue 99% legitimate TCP flows under the RoQ attacks.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288875","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Frequency domain analysis;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Spectral analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;USA Councils","Internet;filtering theory;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","QoS;TCP traffic flows;energy distribution properties;filtering scheme;flow-level spectral analysis;protocol behavior;reduction-of-quality attacks;sequential hypothesis testing;spectral analysis;spectral shifting","","13","","28","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We implemented a prototype of such a module on a Linux system in order to experimentally verify the feasibility and efficacy of our idea. The results obtained are quite encouraging, furthermore it turned out that our module is quite efficient, as it affected the performance of a testbed Web server with a slowdown factor of only 5.9%.","1097-2641","1-4244-1138-6","1-4244-1138-6","10.1109/PCCC.2007.358922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197958","","Counting circuits;Flow graphs;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Linux;Monitoring;Prototypes;Testing;Web server","Internet;Linux;security of data;telecommunication security","HIDS;Linux system;Web server;host intrusion detection system;impossible paths execution attack prevention;mimicry prevention;slowdown factor","","1","","13","","","11-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
