"A Framework for Clustering Categorical Time-Evolving Data","Fuyuan Cao; Jiye Liang; Liang Bai; Xingwang Zhao; Chuangyin Dang","Sch. of Comput. & Inf.

However, many practical clustering tasks involve changing environments. It is hence recognized that the methods and techniques to analyze the evolving trends for changing environments are of increasing interest and importance. Although the problem of clustering numerical time-evolving data is well-explored, the problem of clustering categorical time-evolving data remains as a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a generalized clustering framework for categorical time-evolving data, which is composed of three algorithms: a drifting-concept detecting algorithm that detects the difference between the current sliding window and the last sliding window, a data-labeling algorithm that decides the most-appropriate cluster label for each object of the current sliding window based on the clustering results of the last sliding window, and a cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm that analyzes the relationship between clustering results at different time stamps. The time-complexity analysis indicates that these proposed algorithms are effective for large datasets. Experiments on a real dataset show that the proposed framework not only accurately detects the drifting concepts but also attains clustering results of better quality. Furthermore, compared with the other framework, the proposed one needs fewer parameters, which is favorable for specific applications.","1063-6706","","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2050891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467229","Categorical time-evolving data;clusters relationship analysis;data labeling;drifting-concept detecting","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Clustering algorithms;Communication system traffic control;Credit cards;Information technology;Labeling;Object detection;Stock markets;Unsupervised learning","computational complexity;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","categorical time-evolving data;changing environments;cluster-relationship-analysis algorithm;clustering tasks;data-labeling algorithm;drifting-concept detecting algorithm;generalized clustering framework;numerical time-evolving data;sliding window;time complexity analysis;unsupervised learning","","5","","34","","2010-05-20","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Distributed Cooperative Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks: An Overlapping Coalition Formation Approach","Tianyu Wang; Lingyang Song; Zhu Han; Saad, W.","State Key Lab. of Adv. Opt. Commun. Syst. & Networks, Peking Univ., Beijing, China","Communications, IEEE Transactions on","20140919","2014","62","9","3144","3160","Cooperative spectrum sensing has been shown to yield a significant performance improvement in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.","0090-6778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693","Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing","Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection","cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user","","0","","37","","2014-08-21","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE Symposium on","20080528","2008","","","187","201","Automata-based representations and related algorithms have been applied to address several problems in information security, and often the automata had to be augmented with additional information. For example, extended finite-state automata (EFSA) augment finite- state automata (FSA) with variables to track dependencies between arguments of system calls. In this paper, we introduce extended finite automata (XFAs) which augment FSAs with finite scratch memory and instructions to manipulate this memory. Our primary motivation for introducing XFAs is signature matching in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Representing NIDS signatures as deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) results in very fast signature matching but for several classes of signatures DFAs can blowup in space. Using nondeterministic finite-state automata (NFA) to represent NIDS signatures results in a succinct representation but at the expense of higher time complexity for signature matching. In other words, DFAs are time-efficient but space-inefficient, and NFAs are space- efficient but time-inefficient. In our experiments we have noticed that for a large class of NIDS signatures XFAs have time complexity similar to DFAs and space complexity similar to NFAs. For our test set, XFAs use 10 times less memory than a DFA-based solution, yet achieve 20 times higher matching speeds.","1081-6011","978-0-7695-3168-7","","10.1109/SP.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531153","finite automata;intrusion detection;regular expressions;signature matching","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Impedance matching;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power generation;Privacy;Shape;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computational complexity;digital signatures;finite automata","extended finite-state automata;faster signature matching;finite scratch memory;information security;network intrusion detection system;space complexity;time complexity","","35","3","33","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulation results using OPNET simulator indicates that packet delivery ratio, in the presence of malicious nodes, reduces remarkably and proposed approach can prevent the effect of black hole attacks.","","978-1-4577-0730-8","978-964-463-428-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5955622","AODV;black hole attack;hash chain","IP networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","","","","1","","23","","","17-19 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As part of the proposed solution the data is collected in a relational data base system, to facilitate data correlation, as well as making it available through an easy to use Web interface.

IEEE","20070212","2006","","","1","7","Several approaches have been proposed for intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks. Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected ad hoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected ad hoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000times2000 m <sup>2</sup>) can only improve from 76.5% to 79.9% with selective dropping attacks. Thus, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile ad hoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data dropping attacks performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76.5% with selective dropping attacks. With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87% (with a single ferry) to 93% (with four ferries) with selective dropping attacks. Without the mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio with black hole attacks drops to 65.9%. With FBIDM, the achieved delivery ratio ranges from 82.9% (with a single ferry) to 91.9% (with four ferries) with black hole attacks","","1-4244-0617-X","1-4244-0618-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086633","DSR;DoS resilience;disruption tolerant networkst;intrusion detection;routing;sparsely connected adhoc networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data","FBIDM scheme;ferry-based intrusion detection-mitigation scheme;mobile ad hoc network;sparsely connected network","","3","","17","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using customised analysis tools we study the traffic collected from the MANET at three different stages: i) regular operation, ii) with a ""benign"" wormhole joining distant parts of the network, and iii) under stress from wormhole attackers who control a link in the MANET and drop packets at random. Our focus is on detecting anomalous behaviour using timing analysis of routing traffic within the network. We first show how to identify intruders based on the protocol irregularities that their presence creates once they begin to drop traffic. More significantly, we go on to demonstrate that the mere existence of the wormhole itself can be identified, before the intruders begin the packet-dropping phase of the attack, by applying simple signal-processing techniques to the arrival times of the routing management traffic. This is done by relying on a property of proactive routing protocols- that the stations must exchange management information on a specified, periodic basis. This exchange creates identifiable traffic patterns and an intrinsic ""valid station"" fingerprint that can be used for intrusion detection","","1-4244-0617-X","1-4244-0618-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086522","","Communication system traffic control;Fingerprint recognition;Information management;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Signal processing;Stress control;Testing;Timing","IP networks;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;multiprocessor interconnection networks;routing protocols;security of data;signal processing;telecommunication traffic","IPv6 802.11b wireless MANET;customised analysis tools;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;packet timing analysis;proactive routing protocol;routing management traffic;signal-processing technique;wormhole attack detection","","9","","26","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed mechanism does not need parameterizations since all the used parameters are deduced from public real internet traces using statistical approaches and uses TCP delays as a detection parameter. It is dynamic since the detection is proportional to the severity of the congestion. Experimental results have shown that the proposed mechanism is able to detect congestion rapidly and does not suffer from false alarms.","","978-1-4673-5306-9","","10.1109/ICCITechnology.2013.6579538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6579538","Active Queue Management;Congestion Detection;Internet;TCP;throughput","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Estimation;Information technology;Internet;Logic gates;Monitoring","Internet;telecommunication links;transport protocols","Internet congestion;TCP delay-based mechanism;active queue management algorithms;aggregation link;buffer statistics","","0","","19","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tasks from different users may be performed on the same machine. Therefore, one primary security concern is whether user data is secure in cloud. On the other hand, hacker may facilitate cloud computing to launch larger range of attack, such as a request of port scan in cloud with multiple virtual machines executing such malicious action. In addition, hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in cloud, for example, evading an easy-to-exploit machine in a cloud and then using the previous compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from cloud to extract the intensions of the actions recorded in logs. Stealthy reconnaissance actions are often neglected by administrator for the insignificant number of violations. Hidden Markov model is adopted to model the sequence of attack performed by hacker and such stealthy events in a long time frame will become significant in the state-aware model.

A new integrated approach is presented for building future, network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS). We integrate the Snort (a NIDS) with a custom-designed anomaly detection system (ADS) to yield a powerful cyber defense system, called CAIDS. This system detects known attacks through signature matching and reveals network anomalies by Internet traffic data mining. The CAIDS design integrates two different detection engines for alert correlation between intrusions and anomalies. We aim to automate signature generation into Snort database. The system was tested over an Internet trace of 24 millions of packets containing 200 attacks. Our simulation experiments result in a 75% detection rate on all attacks with a low 5% false alarm rate. The system generates alerts on both intrusive attacks to distributed resources and anomalies detected in the Internet, intranet, and extranet connections.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420251","","Buildings;Data mining;Distributed computing;Extranets;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;computer network management;data mining;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic data mining;Snort;automatic signature matching;cyber defense system;distributed computing system;network anomalies detection system;network security breach;network-based intrusion detection system","","4","","16","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted to a number of performance enhancing techniques (e.g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an attribute authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography).

CUDA programming model provides the programmers adequate C language like APIs to better exploit the parallel power of the GPU. K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we propose CUKNN, a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN. It launches two CUDA kernels, distance calculation kernel and selecting kernel. In the distance calculation kernel, a great number of concurrent CUDA threads are issued, where each thread performs the calculation between the query object and a reference object; in the selecting kernel, threads in a block find the local-k nearest neighbors of the query object concurrently, and then a thread is invoked to find the global-k nearest neighbors out of the queues of local-k neighbors. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of GPU. We evaluate our implementation by using synthetic dataseis and a real physical simulation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.7IX speedup on the synthetic dataseis and 42.49X on the physical simulation dataset including I/O cost. It also shows good scalability when varying the number of dimensions of the reference dataset, the number of objects in the reference dataset, and the number of objects in the query dataset.","","978-1-4244-6356-5","","10.1109/SWS.2010.5607480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5607480","","Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Nearest neighbor searches;Programming","C language;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;optimisation;pattern classification","C language;CUDA optimization techniques;CUDA-enabled GPU;KNN;classification technique;coprocessor;graphics processing units;parallel implementation;parallel k-nearest neighbor algorithm;query dataset;text classification","","3","1","18","","","16-17 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accessing the home-network from the external network is not still popular for low-end users. This is mainly because of the complex configuration of firewall/NAT policy and of the anxiety for security vulnerability which can be caused by statically opening the external ports. To solve these problems, our system provides easy-to-configure, easy-to-use remote accessing method. With a simple Web browser operation, remote users can dynamically open and close the firewall of the home gateway. The firewall rule creation is based on an authentication of the remote client, and thus only packets from the authorized client can pass through the firewall. The system also provides simple policy-template creating system that provides easy installation of the home-network appliances.","","0-7803-8784-8","","10.1109/CCNC.2005.1405247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405247","","Authentication;Cameras;Consumer electronics;Control systems;Home appliances;Home automation;IP networks;Laboratories;Network address translation;Network servers","Internet;authorisation;home automation;internetworking;online front-ends","Internet;PVR;Web browser operation;home file senders;home-network appliances;home-use gateways;network cameras;policy-template creating system;remote accessing method;remote client authentication;remote configurable firewall system","","3","8","3","","","3-6 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","","1-4244-0798-2","1-4244-0799-0","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, four open source regular expression match engines are introduced, include Henry Spencer's regex library, PCRE, RE2, and TRE. An evaluation of the four libraries on expressive power, data structure, memory usage and performance is proposed. The evaluation is based on analysis of their source code and black-box testing. Also a list of benchmarks is presented to do this evaluation. The results indicate that PCRE supports more features but has worse performance than other libraries, RE2 performs well on both time and memory usage but does not support backreferences.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","","978-1-4244-1094-1","978-1-4244-1094-1","10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448606","distributed algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;packet dropping attack;routing security","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Degradation;Femtocell networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Robustness;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc network;distributed protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc networks;network security;packet dropping attack;routing information","","6","3","7","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, for a comprehensive intranet security strategy, such defenses alone may not be enough. An enterprise needs mechanisms to analyze alerts and detect real attacks, and policies on how to respond to attacks. A framework for effective response to detection of misuse or attack is a central theme. The focus is towards security of corporate intranets. We first discuss the access control models that are currently being deployed and used at most intranet solutions. Using role based access control as a base, we develop a framework of interaction of various entities in the model. We then propose a prioritization scheme based on cost of impact in case of misuse and business criticality of transactions. The scheme is developed based on categorization and prioritization of risk and vulnerability assessment results for an enterprise intranet. Alerts are a critical element of a real-time response, but how alert engines operate and filter tons of log data decides the effectiveness of such infrastructure. We propose incorporation of priority schemes into alert mechanisms to develop a more effective intrusion countermeasure against misuse and attack. It leverages the enterprise's investment in security technology to develop an optimized solution to respond to those attacks, by advising the enterprise's on-site administrators.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232418","","Access control;Authorization;Computer science;Costs;Data security;Filters;Information security;Investments;Search engines;USA Councils","authorisation;business communication;computer crime;intranets;risk management","access control model;alert engines;alert mechanism;business transaction;corporate intranet;enterprise intranet;enterprise security;intranet access security;intrusion countermeasures;prioritization scheme;real-time response;risk assessment;role based access control","","0","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increase in Internet usage and growing number of attacks which must be searched for has meant hardware acceleration has become essential in the prevention of DPI becoming a bottleneck to a network if used on an edge or core router. In this paper we present a new multi-pattern matching algorithm which can search for the fixed strings contained within these rules at a guaranteed rate of one character per cycle independent of the number of strings or their length. Our algorithm is based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm with our modifications resulting in a memory reduction of over 98% on the strings tested from the Snort ruleset. This allows the search structures needed for matching thousands of strings to be small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. Combined with a simple architecture for hardware, this leads to high throughput and low power consumption. Our hardware implementation uses multiple string matching engines working in parallel to search through packets. It can achieve a throughput of over 40 Gbps (OC-768) when implemented on a Stratix 3 FPGA and over 10 Gbps (OC-192) when implemented on the lower power Cyclone 3 FPGA.","1530-1591","978-1-4244-7054-9","","10.1109/DATE.2010.5457172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457172","","Acceleration;Energy consumption;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Inspection;Payloads;Search engines;Testing;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;string matching","Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm;Cyclone 3 FPGA;Internet usage;Snort ruleset;Stratix 3 FPGA;deep packet inspection;field programmable gate arrays;fixed strings;memory reduction;multipattern matching algorithm;multiple string matching engines;on-chip memory;power consumption;ultra-high throughput string matching","","0","","18","","","8-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Enforcement of network security policies to low level security mechanisms faces some essential difficulties. Consistency, verification, and maintenance are the major ones of these difficulties. One approach to overcome these difficulties is to automate the process of translation of high level security policy into low level security mechanisms. This paper introduces a framework of an automation process that translates a high level security policy into low level security mechanisms. The framework is described in terms of three phases; in the first phase all network assets are categorized according to their roles in the network security and relations between them are identified to constitute the network security model. This proposed model extends the organization based access control (OrBAC) model to include not only access control policy but also some other administrative security policies like auditing policy. Besides, it enables matching of each rule of the high level security policy with the corresponding ones of the low level security policy. Through the second phase, the high level security policy is mapped into the network security model. The second phase could be considered as a translation of the high level security policy into an intermediate model level. Finally, the intermediate model level is translated automatically into low level security mechanism. The paper illustrates the applicability of proposed approach through an application example.","","978-1-4244-3807-5","978-1-4244-3806-8","10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069371","Network security;OrBAC model;Security management;Security modeling;Security policy","Access control;Automation;Computer science;Computer security;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Resource management;Specification languages","authorisation;computer network management;telecommunication security","active directory;firewall management;high level network security policy;intrusion detection system;organization-based access control model","","2","","14","","","10-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Congress on","20090529","2009","","","2029","2035","In the paper we present a novel approach based on applying a modern metaheuristic Gene Expression Programming (GEP) to detecting web application attacks. This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and web server mechanisms to put them in a web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.","","978-1-4244-2958-5","978-1-4244-2959-2","10.1109/CEC.2009.4983190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4983190","","Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Web server","SQL;genetic algorithms;online front-ends;query processing;security of data","SQL;Web application attack detection;Web browser;Web server mechanisms;data retrieval;intrusion detection problem;metaheuristic gene expression programming","","1","","15","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently e-Healthcare application providers are adopting Cloud computing to handle immense processing load and to reduce service delivery cost. Identity management has been an issue which hinders in adoption of e-Healthcare applications, due to sensitivity of the data involved in it. Existing Cloud based e-Healthcare applications provide access to their services though Single-Sign-On (SSO) protocols. Traditional SSO uses asymmetric encryption, thus increasing the execution load on Cloud gateway and on Identity Provider as well. In this paper we propose a methodology of SSO for Cloud applications by utilizing Peer-to-Peer concepts to distribute processing load among computing nodes within Cloud. The proposed scheme, called Chord for Cloud (C4C), decreases the number of authentication request send to Identity Provider and disseminates the authentication process within the federated environment of Cloud, through Chord algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been shown through argumentation scenarios.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598033","","Authentication;Cloud computing;Clouds;Encryption;Fingers;Medical services;Peer to peer computing","Internet;cryptography;health care;medical information systems;message authentication;peer-to-peer computing;protocols","SSO protocol;asymmetric encryption;authentication process;authentication request;chord based identity management;chord for cloud;cloud computing;cloud gateway;distributed processing;e-healthcare cloud application;healthcare awareness;identity provider;peer-to-peer concept;service delivery cost;single-sign-on protocol","","2","","12","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Above all, the data set is classified into two clusters by FCM. Then, support vector machine (SVM) with a fuzzy membership function is to testify whether the data set can be further classified. Thus, the result of clusters can be obtained by repeating the computation process. Because affiliating matrix, obtained by the introduction of SVM into FCM, is defined to be the fuzzy membership function, each different input data sample can have different penalty value, and the separating hyper-plane is optimized. F-CMSVM is an unsupervised algorithm in which it is neither needed to label training data set nor specify clustering number. As shown from our simulation experiment over networks connection records from KDD CUP 1999 data set, F-CMSVM has efficient performance in clustering number optimization and intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-5958-2","","10.1109/ICNC.2010.5583250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5583250","clustering number;fuzzy C-means algorithm;fuzzy membership function;intrusion detection;support vector machine","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Training data","fuzzy set theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines;unsupervised learning","affiliating matrix;fuzzy c-means algorithm;fuzzy membership function;intrusion detection system;number determination clustering;support vector machine","","0","","10","","","10-12 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on","20030521","2003","","","44","61","A critical problem faced by a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is that of ambiguity. The NIDS cannot always determine what traffic reaches a given host nor how that host will interpret the traffic, and attackers may exploit this ambiguity to avoid detection or cause misleading alarms. We present a lightweight solution, active mapping, which eliminates TCP/IP-based ambiguity in a NIDS analysis with minimal runtime cost. Active mapping efficiently builds profiles of the network topology and the TCP/IP policies of hosts on the network; a NIDS may then use the host profiles to disambiguate the interpretation of the network traffic on a per-host basis. Active mapping avoids the semantic and performance problems of traffic normalization, in which traffic streams are modified to remove ambiguities. We have developed a prototype implementation of active mapping and modified a NIDS to use the active mapping-generated profile database in our tests. We found wide variation across operating systems' TCP/IP stack policies in real-world tests (about 6700 hosts), underscoring the need for this sort of disambiguation.","1081-6011","0-7695-1940-7","","10.1109/SECPRI.2003.1199327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199327","","Costs;Databases;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Prototypes;Runtime;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","authorisation;computer network management;network operating systems;network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","NIDS evasion;TCP/IP-based ambiguity;active mapping;disambiguation;host TCP/IP policies;host profiles;misleading alarms;network intrusion detection system;network topology profiles;operating systems;traffic","","26","28","20","","","11-14 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Comparing and evaluating the effectiveness of these IDS techniques has been hindered by the limited number of large-scale MANET deployments, the lack of publicly available network traces of actual MANET traffic, and the difficulty in defining typical application and mobility scenarios. Network simulation tools have allowed researchers to study MANET IDSs without purchasing mobile nodes or conducting costly and time-consuming field trial tests. These simulations, however, have been conducted using widely varying assumptions on background network traffic, mobility, previous security associations, and the type of malicious network activity. This paper describes how we use our mLab testbed to create publicly available MANET network traces. These network traces allow researchers to compare the effectiveness of different MANET IDS techniques on the same data set, and conduct offline experiments with new IDS techniques without requiring expensive hardware.","","978-1-4244-0993-8","978-1-4244-0993-8","10.1109/WOWMOM.2007.4351704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4351704","","Automata;Data security;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control;Voting","","","","0","","14","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

An authenticated system call is a system call augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the system call arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls. This paper presents the approach, describes a prototype implementation based on Linux and the PLTO binary rewriting system, and gives experimental results suggesting that the approach is effective in protecting against compromised applications at modest cost.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467810","Intrusion tolerance;compiler techniques;operating systems;sandboxing;security policy","Application software;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Costs;Cryptography;Kernel;Message authentication;Protection;Prototypes","Linux;cryptography;data integrity;formal verification;message authentication;program compilers;program diagnostics;rewriting systems","Linux;binary rewriting system;cryptographic message authentication code;data integrity;static analysis;system call argument;system call authentication;system call monitor;system call verification","","7","3","24","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes. The system also proves that the proposed system is well suited for intrusion detection and prevention in wireless network.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745417","AIS;congestion;intrusion detection;mobility","Bandwidth;Delays;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;artificial immune systems;jamming;packet radio networks;radio networks;security of data","AIS system;IP network;MAC address;agent based intrusion detection system;artificial immune system;jamming signal;negative clone selection;network topology;session hijacking;wireless intrusion signature;wireless network","","0","","12","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explores a unified approach for addressing security and privacy of smart metering (SM) systems. In the process, we present a unified framework that entails the analysis and synthesis of security solutions associated with closely interrelated components of a typical SM system.

Botmaster uses command and control server to control bots. Because botmaster servers use dynamic types and encryption methods to communicate with bots, it's difficult to detect bots. In this research, we designed and developed a system to detect bot-like traffic and deny traffic of who looks like bots. We revised the NTOP program and integrated it with self developed perl programs.

In visual analytics of volumetric data sets we need to define a multidimenional transfer functions. This is a challenging task because of the difficulty in understanding multiple attribute spaces and displaying in physical three dimension space. Frequently, the transfer function is designed based on mapping one or two dimensional space to color properties (RGB) and opacity (A). We propose visualization and interaction methods for analyzing individual clusters as well as cluster distribution within and across levels in the cluster hierarchy. We also provide a clustering method that operates on density rather than individual records. We compute density in the given multidimensional multivariate space. Clusters are formed by areas of high density. We present an approach that automatically computes a hierarchical tree of high density clusters. To visually represent the cluster hierarchy, we present a 2D radial layout that supports an intuitive understanding of the distribution structure of the multidimensional multivariate data set. We apply a semi-automatic coloring scheme based on the 2D radial layout of the hierarchical cluster tree encoding hue, saturation, and value of the HSV color space. The system support an easily method to define the multidimensional transfer function over entire multidimensional attributes space. Finally, the surface extract by applying marching cube methods.","","978-1-4577-1848-9","","10.1109/KSE.2011.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6063445","Multidimensional transfer function;cluster analysis;hierarchical visualization;parallel coordinates;volume rendering","Clustering algorithms;Data visualization;Density functional theory;Image color analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Rendering (computer graphics);Transfer functions","data visualisation;pattern clustering","2D radial layout;HSV color space;cluster distribution;color property;hierarchical cluster tree encoding hue;hierarchical tree;interaction method;marching cube method;medical treatment;multidimensional multivariate space;multivariate volume data;physical simulation;saturation;scalar data;semiautomatic coloring scheme;semiautomatic multidimensional transfer function design;visual analytics;volume visualization;volumetric data set","","0","","35","","","14-17 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm could get a satisfactory performance.","","978-1-4673-0241-8","","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295306","Graph-based clustering;cluster precision;intrusion detection;labeling accuracy;outlier detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Shape","data mining;graph theory;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCup99 data set;LDCGB;anomaly intrusion detection system;data mining;graph-based clustering algorithm;graph-based intrusion detection algorithm;initial cluster number;local deviation coefficient;mixed training dataset;muted attacks;outlier affection;outlier detection method;unknown attacks","","1","","14","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ever increasing online and real time transaction services have led to manifold rise in the problems associated with the database security. Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real-time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server. At the proxy server, data cleaning algorithm is triggered using a sanitizing application. In this framework we include detection and sanitization of the tainted information being sent to the database and innovate a new prototype.","","","","10.1049/cp.2013.2592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950876","Cross Site Scripting Attack;Data Sanitization;Database Security;SQL Attack;SQL Injection;Security Threats","","Internet;SQL;database management systems;query processing;security of data","Internet;SQL code;SQL injection attacker;SQL query;SQL statement;URL;Web application;Web based attacks;application layer attack;confidential information;cross site scripting attack;data redirector program;data security;database attack;database security;illegal approaches;intrusion prevention;proxy server;real-time transaction;reverse proxy framework;sanitization technique;transaction services;unauthorized approaches","","0","","","","","18-19 Oct. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

That's why their detection seems to be a big deal for security systems. However, till now, security systems do not include dedicated processes for covert channel detection. In this paper, we first propose mechanisms to detect common covert channels. Then, within a whole security system, we propose an optimized order regarding the execution of the three major security processes: Firewall, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Covert Channel Detection System (CCDS). It will be demonstrated that the proposed order would allow security systems to offer better processing performances.","","978-1-42443547-0","","10.1109/NTMS.2008.ECP.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689155","","Charge coupled devices;Communication channels;Communication system security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Null value;Protocols;Routing;TCPIP;Testing","computer networks;security of data;transport protocols","communications systems;covert channel detection system;exchange hidden information;firewall integration;intrusion detection system;optimized TCP/IP protocols;security systems;undetectable hidden information","","2","","9","","","5-7 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
