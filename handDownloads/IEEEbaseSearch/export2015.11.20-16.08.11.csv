For systems whose lion share of service is delivered by (embedded) software, process-centred methods are seen to be no longer sufficient. Recent safety norms (for example, ISO 26262) thus prescribe the use of safety models for both hardware and software. However, failure rates or probabilities for software are difficult to justify. Only if developers take good design decisions from the outset will they achieve safety goals efficiently. To support safety-oriented navigation of the design space and to bridge the existing gap between qualitative analyses for software and quantitative ones for hardware, we propose a fault-tree-based approach to the safety analysis of software-controlled systems. Assigning intervals instead of fixed values to events and using Monte-Carlo sampling, probability mass functions of failure probabilities are derived. Further analysis of PMF lead to estimates of system quality that enable safety managers to take an optimal choice between design alternatives and to target cost-efficient solutions in every phase of the design process.","1071-9458","978-1-4244-5375-7","978-0-7695-3878-5","10.1109/ISSRE.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362097","Embedded systems;fault tree analysis;probability intervals;safety;simulation;software.","Bridges;Embedded software;Fault trees;Hardware;ISO standards;Navigation;Sampling methods;Software measurement;Software quality;Software safety","Monte Carlo methods;fault trees;sampling methods;software quality","ISO 26262;Monte-Carlo sampling;embedded software;failure probabilities;failure rates;fault tree analysis;probability mass functions;process-centred methods;safety-related quality;second-order probabilities;software-controlled component systems","","2","","45","","","16-19 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensuring the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability of these detectors as well as to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems consist of basic information related to the TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11-specific attacks such as deauthentication attacks or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11-specific intrusions. Our model for feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a means to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm. In the experimental section of this paper, we study the impact of the optimization of the feature set for wireless intrusion detection systems on the performance and learning time of different types of classifiers based on neural networks. Experimental results with three types of neural network architectures clearly show that the optimization of a wireless feature set has a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the intrusion detection system.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226620","Feature selection;K-means;information gain ratio;intrusion detection systems;neural networks.;wireless networks","","feature extraction;neural net architecture;optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;transport protocols;wireless LAN","MAC layer DoS attack;TCP/IP header;feature reduction;hybrid model;k means classifier;lower level protocol frames;network resources;neural network architecture;optimal set;wireless feature set;wireless intrusion detection system","","9","","26","","2009-08-28","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We first present a pattern extraction algorithm to generate maximal patterns from system call trails. Overlap relationship between patterns is subsequently investigated and stored Finally, both maximal patterns and their relationships are exploited to detect deviations from normal application behavior. We test this idea using the popular sendmail data set and the login data set obtained from the University of New Mexico.

In this paper, a scheme using association algorithm and clustering algorithm is proposed for routing anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks. The scheme uses the Apriori algorithm to extract traffic patterns from both routing table and network traffic packets and subsequently the K-means cluster algorithm adaptively generates a detection model. Through the combination of these two algorithms, routing attacks can be detected effectively and automatically. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it is able to detect new attacks that have not previously been seen Moreover, the proposed detection scheme is based on no priori knowledge and then can be applied to a wide range of different sensor networks for a variety of routing attacks.","","978-1-4244-1009-5","978-1-4244-1009-5","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469386","anomaly detection;data-mining;routing attacks;wireless sensor networks","Authentication;Clustering algorithms;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;feature extraction;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","Apriori algorithm;anomaly detection;association algorithm;clustering algorithm;data-mining;traffic pattern extraction;wireless routing attacks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","13","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture that addresses these challenges while facilitating accurate detection of MANET-specific and conventional attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which detection data is acquired at the leaves and is incrementally aggregated, reduced, and analyzed as it flows upward toward the root. Security management directives flow downward from nodes at the top. To maintain communications efficiency, the hierarchy is automatically reconfigured as needed using clustering techniques in which clusterheads are selected based on topology and other criteria.

We focus on the problem of anonymizing IP addresses in a trace. More specifically, we are interested in prefix-preserving anonymization in which the prefix relationship among IP addresses is preserved in the anonymized trace, making such a trace usable in situations where prefix relationships are important. The goal of our work is two fold. First, we develop a cryptography-based, prefix-preserving anonymization technique that is provably as secure as the existing well-known TCPdpriv scheme, and unlike TCPdpriv, provides consistent prefix-preservation in large scale distributed setting. Second, we evaluate the security properties inherent in all prefix-preserving IP address anonymization schemes (including TCPdpriv). Through the analysis of Internet backbone traffic traces, we investigate the effect of some types of attacks on the security of any prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm. We also derive results for the optimum manner in which an attack should proceed, which provides a bound on the effectiveness of attacks in general.","1092-1648","0-7695-1856-7","","10.1109/ICNP.2002.1181415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181415","","Binary trees;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Decision making;Stress","Internet;cryptography;optimisation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP addresses;Internet backbone traffic traces;Internet research;TCPdpriv scheme;confidential information;cryptography;measurement-based security evaluation;optimisation;prefix-preserving IP address anonymity;prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm;private information;real-world traffic traces;security attacks;security properties","","17","","21","","","12-15 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process.

Unlike in conventional network systems, the services and resources in grid are heterogeneous and dynamic, they also belong to different domains. So the intrusion detection system (IDS) for grid should be a system which could rapidly and dynamically integrate the related node detection resources of a grid computing application according to the dynamic detection demand and ensure the security of grid computing. Conventional network IDS lack the necessary flexibility needed by grid environment and could not dynamically adjust their structure to the dynamic grid computing applications. This paper provides a new flexible multi-agent approach to intrusion detection for grid (MAIDG). MAIDG not only takes advantage of the flexibility and autonomy of agent technology, but also makes good use of the Globus Toolkit4.0 (GT4)'s data management components which provide the virtual interfaces for all the (heterogeneous or homogeneous) detection resources and realize the publication, location, and high performance transfer of detection data.

Regular expression matching is achieved by NFA and DFA. DFA is suitable for high-speed IDS due to its efficiency. However, the combined compilation of multiple rules containing “.*” may blow up in state and storage space. In this paper, we give an explanation to this problem from the prospective of information theory, and propose a multidimensional mathematical model focusing on the most serious state explosion. We divide redundant states into zero-dimensional ones and one-dimensional ones. The former are compressed by dimension, and the later are dynamically built. Theory proof illustrates that the space complexity of the model reaches the theoretical lower bound. Then we propose the multi-dimensional finite automata (MFA) based on the model. Experimental results show that, MFA reduces greatly the construction time, memory and matching time, compared with several typical state-of-the-arts DFA improved algorithms.","","","","10.1109/HPSR.2014.6900887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900887","DFA DPI;IDS;regular expression;state explosion","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Complexity theory;Explosions;Mathematical model;Redundancy;Security","computational complexity;computer network security;finite automata;pattern matching","DFA;MFA;NFA;high-speed IDS;information theory;lower bound;multidimensional finite automata;multidimensional mathematical model;network security;one-dimensional state explosion;regular expression matching algorithm;space complexity;state space;storage space;zero-dimensional state explosion","","0","","22","","","1-4 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To give a simple example, a malicious node can continually transmit a radio signal in order to block any legitimate access to the medium and/or interfere with reception. This act is called jamming and the malicious nodes are referred to as jammers. Jamming techniques vary from simple ones based on the continual transmission of interference signals, to more sophisticated attacks that aim at exploiting vulnerabilities of the particular protocol used. In this survey, we present a detailed up-to-date discussion on the jamming attacks recorded in the literature. We also describe various techniques proposed for detecting the presence of jammers.

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a Â¿gray boxÂ¿ since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.","","978-1-4244-3835-8","978-0-7695-3816-7","10.1109/AICI.2009.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342","decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning","Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics)","binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure","","1","","16","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the flexibility provided by their dynamic infrastructure MANETs are vulnerable to many types of security attacks. Furthermore, many conventional security solutions have been developed. However, these proposals suffer from the problems of tests and evaluations. Among these solutions the intrusion detection systems (IDS). To improve the quality of protection of MANETs provided by intrusion detection systems (IDS), we provide assessment of detection and test procedures more effective. In this paper, we make a thorough analysis of existing attacks. For this we propose a new system to classify attacks based on attributes that appear to be the best classification criteria to generate test-cases.

The method uses promiscuous mode of working along with rating and collaborative decision making based on multiple threshold values. All nodes join the network with an initial value of 1 for an honesty rate index, termed as h-rate. The h-rate of a node dynamically increases or decreases depending on its behavior. A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued. The proposed rule-based scheme reduces the h-rate of a node gradually, if it behaves abnormally. This provides an inherent mechanism against phantom intrusion detection. The h-rate may also be used for secure routing in MANET.","","978-0-7695-3184-7","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557846","IDS;MANET;attacks;collaborative decision making;neighborhood watch;private key","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;security of data","MANET;collaborative decision making;collaborative intrusion detection system;honesty-rate;mobile ad-hoc networks;multiple threshold values;packet forwarding;phantom intrusion detection;rule-based scheme","","4","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing security as a one-size-fits-all solution results in a system that is far too rigid to accommodate the needs of different application domains. Security mechanisms can depend on the hardware that is available and can be changed over time. Offering a system that can cope with such change without the need of major re-engineering is a major challenge. Moreover, not at all time the same security level has to be maintained. A system that can adapt its security mechanisms to the actual threat level can deliver better performance. In this paper, we provide an architecture for self-adapting the security concern to the actual context. Context is provided in terms of trust and threat values.

The rapid increase number of video resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize the video events. In this paper, we use the Association Link Network model for organizing video resources from Web. Association Link Network is a kind of semantic link network, which is designed to establish associated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages or documents in digital library) aiming at extending the loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cognitive science considers that the associated relations can make one resource more comprehensive to users, the motivation of ALN is to organize the associated resources loosely distributed in the Web for effectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as browsing, knowledge discovery and publishing, etc. The tags and surrounding texts of video resources are used to represent the semantic content. The relatedness between tags and surrounding texts are implemented in the Association Link Network model. Two data sets from YouTube and Flickr1 are used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can measure the association relations accurately and robustly.","","","","10.1109/SKG.2013.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816584","Association Link Network;semantic link network;video organizing;video representing","Cognition;Organizing;Publishing;Semantic Web;Semantics;Web pages;YouTube","Internet;Web sites;video retrieval","Flickr;YouTube;association link network model;association-rich network;cognitive science;intelligent Web activities;semantic content;semantic link network;video representation;video resources organization","","0","","24","","","3-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel online integrity checker, Block Tapping, which ensures its security benefiting from the isolation property of virtual machine. Block tapping monitors the block-level data streams transparently through block-to-file semantic-translation at the virtual block device layer. Based on the self-described information of virtual storages, Block Tapping detects the file-level malicious behaviors independent of the internal state of the compromised virtual machine. Experiments show that the prototype system successfully captures 13 typical user-mode root kit attacks against virtual storage, and the performance overhead is acceptable.","1521-9097","978-1-4577-1875-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121331","Data Integrity;Transparent Detection;Virtual Storage","Databases;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes;Semantics;Synchronization;Virtual machining","data integrity;data privacy;file organisation;virtual machines;virtual storage","Xen-based computing platform;block-level data stream;block-to-file semantic-translation;blocktapping;file-level malicious behavior;online transparent integrity checker;virtual block device layer;virtual computing environment;virtual machine;virtual storage","","0","","23","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers and scientists are concerned on how to enhance the intrusion detection performance, to be able to deal with real-time attacks and detect them fast from quick response. One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run. The results show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86% on the train set and 85.38% on the test set.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644096","Anomaly detectors generation;feature selection;genetic algorithms","Accuracy;Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","anomaly detectors generation approach;correlation-based feature selection;deterministic crowding niching technique;feature selection techniques;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;principle components analysis;real-time attacks;sequential-floating techniques","","2","","28","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952","978-1-4673-0228-9","978-1-4673-0227-2","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, constructing and maintaining a misuse intrusion detection system for a network is labor Â¿ intensive, since attack scenarios and patterns need to be analyzed and categorized. Moreover, the rules corresponding to the scenarios and patterns need to be carefully hand-coded. In such situations, data mining can be used to ease this inconvenience. This paper proposes a multiple level hybrid classifier for an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers which uses Enhanced C4.5 which rely on labeled training data and an Enhanced Fast Heuristic Clustering Algorithm for mixed data (EFHCAM). The main advantage of this approach is that the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously ""unseen"" attacks. Verification tests have been carried out by using the 1999 KDD Cup data set. From this work, it is observed that significant improvement has been achieved from the viewpoint of both high intrusion detection rate and reasonably low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-1924-1","978-1-4244-1924-1","10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447164","","Classification tree analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Data security;Heuristic algorithms;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Training data","","","","2","","11","","","4-6 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of TorWard. Our data shows that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), DoS (Denial-of-Service) attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malware have been identified.

The structural aspects of cyber threats are in a constant flux, rendering most defensive technologies reactive to previously unknown attack vectors. Unlike structural signature based approaches, both the real-time and aggregate behaviors exhibited by cyber threats over a network provide insight into making-sense of anomalies found on our networks. In this work, we explore the challenges posed in identifying and developing a set of behavior primitives that facilitate the creation of threat narratives use to describe cyber threats anomalies. Thus, we investigate the use aggregate behaviors derived from network flow data establishing initial behavior models used to detect complex cyber threats such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).

However, ATM uses a number of protocols for connection establishment and routing and if these protocols are not functioning correctly (e.g., due to misconfiguration, component failure or active attack), denial of service may result. Since ATM protocol irregularities occur below IP, they are not detectable by the IP intrusion detection systems that are prevalent in today's networks. This paper describes an implementation of an intrusion detection system that detects ATM protocol attacks. This system uses a centralized assessment engine to collect network event notifications from a distributed set of sensors. These sensors monitor ATM protocol activity and send the filtered events to the assessment engine. The assessment engine compares the incoming event traffic against a set of attack templates and, if a match is encountered, it (optionally) activates a set of responses. In addition, this paper describes results that have been obtained from the proof-of-concept implementation, along with initial experience with its use in operational networks. Future research directions that address other unique challenges presented by ATM intrusion detection and response are also described.","","0-7803-7225-5","","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985769","","Asynchronous transfer mode;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Monitoring;Routing protocols;Search engines;Sensor systems;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","asynchronous transfer mode;protocols;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","ATM networks;ATM protocol attacks;asynchronous transfer mode;centralized assessment engine;connection establishment protocols;denial of service;intrusion detection;network event notifications;routing protocols","","1","1","8","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One compelling example, proposed in this paper, is the case of whitelists for DDoS mitigation, where domains broadcast, for each possible DDoS target (!), the set of legitimate customers (client IP addresses) whose traffic should not be blocked while a DDoS attack is in progress. However, such a fine-grained whitelist sharing approach appears hardly appealing (to say the least) to operators; not only the indiscriminate sharing of customers' addresses raises privacy concerns, but also it discloses, to competitor domains, business critical information on the identity and activity of customers. In a previous work, we proposed a cryptographic approach called “conditional data sharing”, devised to permit disclosure of cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets of network monitoring data, only when a threshold number of domains are ready to reveal their data. In this paper, we cast such technique to a realistic scenario of whitelist sharing for DDoS mitigation, and we significantly extend the underlying cryptographic approach so as to support disclosure not only for threshold-based policies, but for more general (monotone) access structures.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6824986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824986","","Access control;Computer crime;Conferences;Cryptography;IP networks;Monitoring","computer network security;cryptography","DDoS mitigation;Internet-scale attacks;client IP addresses;competitor domains;conditional data sharing;cross-domain shared fine-grained organized subsets;cryptographic approach;defensive techniques;domains broadcast;legitimate customers;network monitoring data;network security data sharing;privacy concerns;threshold-based policies;whitelist sharing","","0","","39","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7","978-1-4244-0003-4","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first phase of the protocol, we design a trust based packet forwarding scheme for detecting and isolating the malicious nodes using the routing layer information. It uses trust values to favor packet forwarding by maintaining a trust counter for each node. A node is punished or rewarded by decreasing or increasing the trust counter. If the trust counter value falls below a trust threshold, the corresponding intermediate node is marked as malicious. In the next phase of the protocol, we provide link-layer security using the CBC-X mode of authentication and encryption.

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented. Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification. Here Real time internet traffic has been captured using packet capturing tool and datasets has been developed. Also few standard datasets have been used in this research work. Then using standard attribute selection algorithms, a reduced statistical feature dataset has been developed. After that, Six ML algorithms AdaboostM1, C4.5, Random Forest tree, MLP, RBF and SVM with Polykernel function classifiers are used for IP traffic classification. This implementation and analysis shows that Tree based algorithms are effective ML techniques for Internet traffic classification with accuracy up to of 99.7616 %.","","978-1-4799-2274-1","","10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726074","AdaboostM1;C4.5;Internet Traffic Classification;MLP;Machine Learning;RBF and SVM with Polykernel function;Random Forest tree","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Support vector machines;Training;Vegetation","IP networks;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IP traffic classification;IP traffic identification;IP traffic recognition;Internet traffic classification;Internet traffic flows;MLP;RBF;SVM;TCP port numbers;UDP port numbers;artificial intelligence;classification process;machine learning based Internet traffic recognition;packet attributes;packet capturing tool;packet payloads;polykernel function classifiers;random forest tree;real time Internet traffic;reduced statistical feature dataset;standard attribute selection algorithms;statistical pattern recognition;tree based algorithms;unsupervised learning","","0","","34","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low Energy Aware Cluster Hierarchy (LEACH) is one of the most popular hierarchical routing protocols in WSN that consumes limited energy; thus increases the network lifetime. The security of data transfer via WSN is a challenging issue, especially with the existence of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, experimental analysis of the impact of existing DoS attacks on the performance of LEACH protocol, including Flooding attack, Black hole attack and Gray Hole attack will be presented. Secondly, a new DoS attack on LEACH called Scheduling attack will be introduced. In order to check the reliable operation of LEACH routing protocol, all attacks mentioned above are implemented and their impacts on the performance of the LEACH in terms of different metrics including packet delivery ratio, network lifetime and energy consumption have been evaluated.","","","","10.1109/IACS.2015.7103191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103191","Black Hole attack;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray Hole attack;LEACH;NS2;Scheduling attack;WSN;cluster;energy;network lifetime;security","Base stations;Computer crime;Data models;Floods;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","LEACH protocol;WSN;black hole attack;denial of service attacks;energy consumption;flooding attack;gray hole attack;hierarchical routing protocols;low energy aware cluster hierarchy;network lifetime;packet delivery ratio;scheduling attack;security of data transfer;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","7-9 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners. We also show that the proposed system, including our scheme and algorithm, provides good performance in terms of the rate of false positi- es.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388436","Adaptive threshold setting;automatic portscan detection;false negative;false positive","Adaptive systems;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heating;IP networks;Real-time systems","","","","1","","19","","","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we progressively enhance the GHSOM to present a new delicate version, named EGHSOM. It consists of a meaningful initialization process instead of random initialization, a novel splitting threshold technique to stabilize the growth topology, merging and pruning methods on neurons to settle the topology and accelerate the detection, and a classification-confidence threshold to detect unknown anomaly in computer networks. The final model is trained using real-time traffic in addition to NSL-KDD and compared with other approaches.

Masquerading is an important factor for identity theft and current authentication systems using traditional methods woefully lack mechanisms to detect and prevent it. This paper presents an application independent, continual, non-intrusive, fast and easily deployable user re-authentication system based on behavioral biometrics. These behavioral attributes are extracted from the keyboard and mouse operations of the user. They are used to identify and non-intrusively authenticate the user periodically. To extract suitable user attributes, we propose a novel heuristic that uses the percentage of mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio and interaction quotient (IQ). In the re-authentication process, every time, the current behavior of the user is compared with the stored ldquoexpectedrdquo behavior. All deviations are noted and after a certain deviation threshold is reached, the system logs the user out of the current session. The underlying heuristic prevents imposters from misusing the system. Experimental results show that the proposed heuristic can greatly improve the accuracy of application-based and application independent systems to 96.4% and 82.2% respectively.","","978-1-4244-5019-0","978-1-4244-5020-6","10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339075","Behavioral Biometrics;interaction ratio;k-Nearest neighbor;neural networks;statistical analysis;user re-authentication","Authentication;Biometrics;Hardware;Internet;Keyboards;Mice;Neural networks;Pins;Statistical analysis;Testing","biometrics (access control);keyboards;message authentication;mouse controllers (computers);pattern classification;user centred design","behavioral biometrics;identity theft;interaction quotient;masquerading;mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio;user reauthentication systems","","2","6","30","","","28-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

Then, IFCM algorithm is used to intrusion detection, and satisfactory experiment effects are obtained.","","978-1-4244-2727-4","","10.1109/ISISE.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4732404","fuzzy C-means algorithm;intrusion detection","","fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;security of data","fuzzy c-means algorithm;intrusion detection;pattern clustering","","3","","6","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we investigate the applicability of neural networks for traffic prediction, focusing on the multilayer feedforward architecture and comparing the performance of different back-propagation algorithms. Prediction is carried out for different random aggregates (obtained through reversible sketches, introduced to improve the scalability of the solution) of traffic flows and, after comparing the prediction error with a threshold, a voting procedure is used to decide about the nature of the current data (with the additional possibility of identifying anomalous flows thanks to the features of reversible sketches). The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method (in terms of low false alarm rates and convergence speed) for an adequate choice of the learning algorithm.","","","","10.1109/CAMAD.2014.7033256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033256","Anomaly Detection;Neural Network;Sketch","Aggregates;Algorithm design and analysis;Biological neural networks;Convergence;Intrusion detection;Prediction algorithms","IP networks;multilayer perceptrons","IP networks management;back-propagation algorithms;bursty nature;learning algorithm;multilayer feedforward architecture;neural network based anomaly detection;performance analysis;traffic prediction;voting procedure","","0","","22","","","1-3 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This assumption may be unreasonable in the context of attacks and intrusions. An intruder could compromise any number of the available copies of a service resulting in a false sense of security. The kernel based approaches have proven to be quite effective but they cause performance impacts if any code changes are in the critical path. We provide an alternate user space mechanism consisting of process monitors by which such user space daemons can be unambiguously monitored without causing serious performance impacts. A framework that claims to provide such a feature must itself be tamper-resistant to attacks. We theoretically analyze and compare some relevant schemes and show their fallibility. We propose our own framework that is based on some simple principles of graph theory and well-founded concepts in topological fault tolerance, and show that it can not only unambiguously detect any such attacks on the services but is also very hard to subvert.

Botnets are collections of compromised computers which are remotely controlled by its originator (BotMaster) under a common Commond-and-Control (C&C) infrastructure. They provide a distributed platform for several illegal activities such as launching distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against critical targets, malware distribution, phishing, and click fraud. Most of the existing Botnet detection approaches concentrate only on particular Botnet command and control (C&C) protocols (e.g., IRC, HTTP) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can become ineffective as Botnets change their structure and C&C techniques. The detection of Botnet has been a major research topic in recent years. Different techniques and approaches have been proposed for detection and tracking of Botnet. This survey classifies Botnet detection techniques into two approaches. One approach is based on setting up honeynets and another approach is based on Intrusion Detection System( IDS) which has been categorized into signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques.","","978-1-4244-5537-9","","10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563555","Botnet;P2P;bot;malicious activities;patterns","Computational modeling;Computers;Cryptography;Monitoring","Internet;command and control systems;computer crime;cryptographic protocols;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","Botnet detection technique;Commond-and-Control infrastructure;Taxonomy;anomaly based detection technique;compromised computer;cyber attack;distributed denial of service;honeynet;intrusion detection system;malware distribution","","8","","28","","","9-11 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Correlation component is a procedure which aggregates alerts according to certain criteria. The aggregated alerts could have common features or represent steps of pre-defined scenario attacks. Correlation approaches composed of a single component or a comprehensive set of components. The effectiveness of a component depends heavily on the nature of the dataset analyzed. The order of correlation component will affect the correlation process performance. Moreover not all components should be used for different dataset. This paper presents an agent-based alert correlation model. Learning agent learns the nature of dataset within a network then guides the whole correlation process and components in such a suitable way of which components could be used and in which order.

Existing IDPSs do not seem to provide a satisfactory method of achieving these two conflicting goals. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation.

In recent years, data mining-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have demonstrated high accuracy, good generalization to novel types of intrusion, and robust behavior in a changing environment. Still, significant challenges exist in the design and implementation of production quality IDSs. Instrumenting components such as data transformations, model deployment, and cooperative distributed detection remain a labor intensive and complex engineering endeavor. This paper describes DAID, a database-centric architecture that leverages data mining within the Oracle RDBMS to address these challenges. DAID also offers numerous advantages in terms of scheduling capabilities, alert infrastructure, data analysis tools, security, scalability, and reliability.

Through the integrating of the three software component, intelligent intrusion detection is capable of offering a smart home security system. The implementation results show that the presented system at most identify three intruding subjects with at least 80% accuracy better than the previous works. The presented system demonstrates a smart and automatic solution in comparison with legacy approaches.","1062-922X","978-1-4244-2793-2","978-1-4244-2794-9","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346092","Home Security;Hybrid-model Search Algorithm;Image processing;Multi-intrusion detection system;UPnP","Competitive intelligence;Computer science;Cybernetics;Image processing;Image storage;Information security;Intrusion detection;Motion estimation;Smart homes;USA Councils","image processing;security of data","PDA;home intrusion;hybrid-model searching algorithm;intelligent detection approach;intrusion image processing;multiple intrusions;smart home security system;software component;universal-plug-and-play instant messaging","","0","","13","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These revolutionary and disrupting technologies are available to the users in various hardware form-factors like Smart Phones, Embedded Appliances, Configurable or Customizable add-on devices, etc. One such technology is Bluetooth [1], which enables the users to communicate and exchange various kinds of information like messages, audio, streaming music and file transfer in a Personal Area Network (PAN). Though it enables the user to carry-out these kinds of tasks without much effort and infrastructure requirements, they inherently bring with them the security and privacy concerns, which need to be addressed at different levels. In this paper, we present an application-layer framework, which provides strong mutual authentication of applications, data confidentiality and data integrity independent of underlying operating system. It can make use of the services of different Cryptographic Service Providers (CSP) on different operating systems and in different programming languages. This framework has been successfully implemented and tested on Android Operating System on one end (using Java language) and MS-Windows 7 Operating System on the other end (using ANSI C language), to prove the framework's reliability/compatibility across OS, Programming Language and CSP. This framework also satisfies the three essential requirements of Security, i.e. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, as per the NIST Guide to Bluetooth Security specification and enables the developers to suitably adapt it for different kinds of applications based on Bluetooth Technology.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6949858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949858","Authentication;Binary Payload;Bluetooth;Confidentiality;Mobile Phone;Security","Encryption;Indexes;Mobile communication;Satellites","Bluetooth;C language;Java;audio streaming;authorisation;computer network reliability;computer network security;cryptography;operating systems (computers);personal area networks;smart phones","ANSI C language;Android operating system;ApXLglevel end-to-end security;Bluetooth security specification;Bluetooth technology;Java language;MS-Windows 7 operating system;NIST Guide;PAN;application-layer framework;audio streaming;communication technologies;computing technologies;configurable add-on devices;cryptographic service providers;customizable add-on devices;data confidentiality;data integrity;embedded appliances;file transfer;framework compatibility;framework reliability;music streaming;operating system;personal area network;privacy concern;programming languages;security concern;smart phones;strong mutual authentication","","0","","8","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It could be as effective as conventional face to face classroom learning under certain situation. Some researchers have proved that e-learning has a positive impact not only for learners, but also for instructors and providers. In fact, e-learning reduces costs, time and improves the performance of learning. However, most of e-learning systems are vulnerable to many attacks. This paper surveys the current protections to address the vulnerabilities of the e-learning systems. It also provides a categorization to the e-learning protections based on source of vulnerabilities.","","978-1-4799-0143-2","","10.1109/ICTSS.2013.6588100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6588100","e-learning;m-learning;security;survey","Data privacy;Electronic learning;Face;Internet;Privacy;Security","computer aided instruction;security of data","e-learning protections;e-learning security;e-learning systems;electronic learning","","0","","56","","","13-14 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to this fact the importance of security in these systems increases. Therefore, the application of intrusion detection systems as security solutions is increasing year by year. These systems (IDSs) are considered as a way of protection against cyber-attacks. However, handling big data constitutes one of the main challenges of intrusion detection systems and is the reason of low performance of these systems from the view of time and space complexity. To address these problems we have proposed an approach to reduce this complexity. Our approach is based on dimensionality reduction and the neural network bottleneck feature extraction is considered as the main method in this research. We have conducted several experiments on a benchmark dataset (NSL-KDD) to investigate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that our approach is promising in terms of accuracy for real-world intrusion detection.","","978-1-4673-7483-5","","10.1109/IKT.2015.7288799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288799","Bottleneck Features;dimensionality reduction;intrusion detection","Biological neural networks;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis","Big Data;computational complexity;data reduction;feature extraction;neural nets;security of data","Big Data handling;IDSs;NSL-KDD;auto-encoder bottleneck features;benchmark dataset;cyber-attacks;information systems;intrusion detection systems;neural network bottleneck feature extraction;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;space complexity;time complexity","","","","","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
