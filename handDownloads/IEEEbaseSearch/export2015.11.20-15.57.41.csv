However these policies may be not sufficient and effective any more when applied to the wireless local area networks (WLANs). WLANs are different from the traditional wired LANs in terms of their exposure to potential threats, vulnerability and security techniques. Intrusions to WLANs are facts of the everyday life and handling them becomes more and more difficult. Currently there is no standardised reference model which may help to design, compare and evaluate the existing or future intrusion handling systems (IHSs) for WLANs. Analysis of the commercial IHSs shows that they all are built as a proprietary systems which are neither taking into consideration existence of other IHSs nor they are trying to find the ways to establish inter-IHS collaboration which may help to achieve better security for the end- users. Hence this paper starts by an analysis of the features of existing IHSs for WLANs, follows with proposing the new ways to enhance their design, and then is discussing development of such a novel reference model for a scalable distributed IHS architecture.","","1-4244-0543-2","1-4244-0543-2","10.1109/CANET.2006.279278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4055210","","Communication system security;Communications technology;Computer networks;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Terminology;Wireless LAN","telecommunication security;wireless LAN","intrusion handling systems;scalable distributed IHS architecture;standardised reference model;wired computer network security;wireless LAN;wireless local area networks","","0","","24","","","19-21 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Detection of Bot Infected PCs Using Destination-Based IP and Domain Whitelists During a Non-Operating Term","Takemori, K.; Nishigaki, M.; Takami, T.; Miyake, Y.","KDDI R&D Labs.

IEEE","20081208","2008","","","1","6","Spam e-mails and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have now become critical issues to the Internet. These attacks are considered to be sent from bot infected PCs. As a bot communicates with a malicious controller over an encrypted channel and updates its code frequently, it becomes difficult to detect infected personal computers (PCs) using pattern-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and antivirus systems (AVs). As sending attack and control packets from the bot process are independent of the user operation, a behavior monitor is effective to detect an anomaly communication. In this paper, we propose a bot detection technique that checks outbound packets with destination-based whitelists. If any outbound packets during the non-operating term do not match the whitelists, the PC is considered to be infected by the bot. The whitelists are a set of a destination IP address and/or domain names (DNs) that are listed by monitoring outbound packets from an un-infected PC. Because the many IPs and DNs are grouped into a few sub-networks and superior DNs, it is easier to maintain the destination-based whitelists than the pattern-based IDS/AV. We implement the proposal system as a host-based detector and evaluate false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) frequencies for detection of bot activities.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698174","","Communication system control;Computer crime;Control systems;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Microcomputers;Personal communication networks;Unsolicited electronic mail;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;telecommunication security;unsolicited e-mail","DDoS;Internet;anomaly communication detection;antivirus system;behavior monitor;bot infected PC detection;destination-based IP;distributed denial of service attack;domain name;domain whitelist;encrypted channel;pattern-based intrusion detection system;spam e-mail","","3","1","18","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method","","0","","30","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network level attack detection solutions focus on the information in the headers of network packets. While, application level attack detection solutions investigate the data fragments carried out in the packet payloads.

This paper presents a self-organizable architecture, which can reorganize and reconfigure a system based on modular agents. It is contrived through observation of biological phenomena, and implements a platform to host the architecture in dynamically changing environments. We draw several key features of the modular agents, describe the principles of the modular agent-based self-organizable framework, and depict how the proposed framework satisfies the functional requirements of network applications, which are made of several agents.

Even a rare vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network security of an entire organisation. Intrusion Detection Systems form an integral component of the mechanisms designed to prevent internet and data communication systems from such attacks. The attacks on the network comprise of information gathering and modification through unauthorized access to resources and denial of service to legitimate users. IDS play a key role in detecting the patterns of behaviour on the network that might be indicative of impending attacks. Majority of groundbreaking research on IDS is carried out on KDD'99 dataset and focuses on either all the attacks in the network or the attacks corresponding to TCP/IP protocol. This paper presents a step forward in this direction where the IDS model addresses a specific part of the network attacks commonly detected at port 7 in UDP. Port scans in UDP account for a sizable portion of the Internet traffic and comparatively little research characterizes security in UDP port scan activity. To meet the growing trend of attacks and other security challenges in the constantly evolving internet arena, this is paper presents a computationally intelligent intrusion detection mechanism using swarm intelligence paradigm, particularly ant colony optimisation, to analyze sample network traces in UDP port scans. This work aims at generating customised and efficient network intrusion detection systems using soft computing to increase general network security through specific network security.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745415","Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO);Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);User Datagram Protocol (UDP);attacks;network security;perpetual echo;port scans","Computers;Internet;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems","ant colony optimisation;computer network security;transport protocols","Internet traffic;TCP/IP protocol;ant colony optimization;computer network security;computer networks escalating complexity;denial of service;intelligent intrusion detection mechanism;intelligent perpetual echo attack detection;malicious exploitation probability;unauthorized access;user datagram protocol port 7","","0","","18","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the matching process is very expensive regarding to the performance of a signature-based NIDS in which the cost is at least linear to the size of the input string and the CPU occupancy rate can reach more than 80 percent in the worst case. This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem. In particular, our scheme incorporates a list technique, namely the blacklist to help filter network packets based on the confidence of the IP domains. Moreover, our scheme will adapt and update the blacklist contents by using the method of statistic-based blacklist generation according to the actual network environment. In the experiment, we implemented our scheme and showed the first experimental evaluation of its effectiveness.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122798","blacklist;intrusion detection;network packet filter","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Table lookup","IP networks;security of data;statistical analysis;string matching","CPU occupancy rate;IP domains;adaptive context-aware packet filter scheme;false alarm rate;signature-based network intrusion detection system;statistic-based blacklist generation;string matching","","0","","20","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach introduces the relevant theories of label switching path in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and makes use of routing path to set up a Trace back Path (TP). During the trace back process, we can reconstruct the attack path on the basis of label switching mechanism. We use mathematical analysis and simulations to evaluate our approach. Our evaluation results show that compared to HIT and SPIE, two state-of-art single-packet trace back approaches, the storage overhead in our approach is only related to the number of routing paths, no matter how many packets traverse on the paths, and the number of queried routers during the trace back process is only related to the number of hops in an attack path.","1066-6192","978-1-4673-0226-5","","10.1109/PDP.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6169557","","Computer crime;IP networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Switches","IP networks;multiprotocol label switching;telecommunication network routing","HIT;MPLS;SPIE;demand routers;label switching path;multi-protocol label switching;routing path;single-packet IP traceback;trace back path","","1","","14","","","15-17 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to address this issue, this work proposes a Distributed Intrusion Detection System for Smart Grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the Analyzing Module (AM) in the multiple layers of smart grids. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid - the home area network (HAN), neighborhood area network (NAN), and the Wide Area Network (WAN) - where they will use Artificial Immune System (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyber attacks. AMs at each level will be trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection.

However, there has only a few research related to similarity evaluation under data stream contexts. The main reason is because of the native feature of data streams, namely, large, continuous, and only one pass scan. It is hard to find an efficient method to evaluate similarity over data streams. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm ESDS(estimating similarity over data streams), which not only can estimate similarity efficiently over data streams under the time warping distance but is the first time to use DTW(dynamic time warping) distance based on the sliding window to deal with similarity evaluation over data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first paper to address this problem. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm, we present a simple but efficiently method to denote the original stream data. In computing the distance of DTW between data streams by using dynamic programming, we also introduce a new distance of DTW which can compute the similarity over data streams efficiently. The experiments of many real and synthetic data sets show that our algorithm can evaluate the similarity over data streams efficiently and not be studied in the previous research.","","978-0-7695-2874-8","","10.1109/FSKD.2007.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406201","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer networks;Data analysis;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Electrostatic discharge;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Sun","data handling;dynamic programming;security of data;time warp simulation","data streams;dynamic programming;dynamic time warping;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor queries","","1","","18","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One such solution to overcome selfishly behaving nodes in wireless network is to detect and exclude them .There are several secure routing protocols to detect routing misbehavior in the direct neighborhood. In this paper, we presented an improved version of Leak detector mechanism and iterative probing mechanism to detect colluding malicious nodes, manipulations of route in wireless multi hop networks. Leak detector enables the calculation of the packet-loss ratio for the individual nodes. Iterative probing enables reliable detection of selfish nodes that drop packets in a MANET.

This paper presents an approach based on extension matrix and genetic algorithm to network misuse detection. Based on extension matrix formed on positive and negative examples, we set up the integer-programming model (IPM) for optimal rule extraction and feature subset selection. Then genetic algorithm is applied to solve IPM and optimal rules are generated for intrusion detection. Those generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment.

To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect attacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes in the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The experiments conducted on the system have shown that it has high detection efficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing systems.","","978-1-4244-7675-6","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679879","","Bayesian methods;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Intrusion detection;Lead;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing","distributed processing;security of data;software agents;software fault tolerance","IDS;autonomous agents;cooperating agents;fault-tolerant distributed intrusion detection system;malicious intruders;networked system security;robust distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","10","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most widely used tools is honeyd for creating honeypots. The logs generated by honeyd can grow very large in size when there is heavy attack traffic in the system, thus consuming a lot of disk space. The huge log size poses difficulty when they are processed and analyzed by security analysts as they consume a lot of time and resources. In this paper, we propose a system which addresses these issues. It has two important modules. The first one is logging module which saves disk space by reducing the log size without losing information. The second module is a log analyzer that can process this log to generate reports and graphs for the security administrators. The analyzer is backward compatible and can process the log file produced by honeyd as well.

But the complexities and diversities of security alert data on modern networks make such analysis extremely difficult. In this paper, we analyze the existing problems of network security situation awareness system and propose a framework for network security situation awareness based on knowledge discovery. The framework consists of the modeling of network security situation and the generation of network security situation. The purpose of modeling is to construct the formal model of network security situation measurement based upon the D-S evidence theory, and support the general process of fusing and analyzing security alert events collected from security situation sensors. The generation of network security situation is to extract the frequent patterns and sequential patterns from the dataset of network security situation based upon knowledge discovery method and transform these patterns to the correlation rules of network security situation, and finally to automatically generate the network security situation graph. Application of the integrated Network Security Situation Awareness system (Net-SSA) shows that the proposed framework supports for the accurate modeling and effective generation of network security situation.","","978-1-4244-6347-3","","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5486194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486194","data mining;knowledge discovery;network security;situation awareness","Computer science;Computer security;Data engineering;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge engineering;Large scale integration;Systems engineering and theory","computer network security;data mining;inference mechanisms","D-S evidence theory;frequent pattern extraction;knowledge discovery;network security situation awareness;network security situation measurement formal model","","2","","14","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lack of proper tools slows down the hunt for information, which would otherwise help in gaining the upper hand against IT based perpetrators. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm which allows categorization of data fragments based solely on their structure, without the need for any meta data. The algorithm is based on measuring the rate of change of the byte contents of digital media and extends the byte frequency distribution based Oscar method presented in an earlier paper. The evaluation of the new method shows a detection rate of 99.2 %, without generating any false positives, when used to scan for JPEG data. The slowest implementation of the algorithm scans a 72.2 MB file in approximately 2.5 seconds and scales linearly","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652088","","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data mining;File systems;Forensics;Hard disks;Information science;Military computing;Telecommunication traffic","police data processing","JPEG data;Oscar method;binary structure;byte frequency distribution;computer forensics tools;data categorization;data fragments;file type identification;working file system","","13","1","14","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel fast string-matching algorithm to detect the exact and like occurrences of a given pattern within input string. It is based on computing the sum of character's values in the search string and comparing this sum with the sum of the values of the corresponding characters in the sliding window. The sliding window includes number of characters equals that of the search string and is right shifted from the beginning and toward the end of the input string. The experimental results reveal that the novel algorithm appears more efficient than BM many times in worst case, and the longer the pattern, the bigger the performance improvement.","","978-1-4799-0460-0","","10.1109/WCCIT.2013.6618726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618726","String matching;algorithmic performance attack;network security","Algorithm design and analysis;Force;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching","Internet;computer network security;search problems;string matching","BM algorithm;Boyer-Moore algorithm;Web security;exact occurrence detection;exact string matching algorithm;fast string matching algorithm;input string;like occurrence detection;like string matching algorithm;network security;performance improvement;search string","","0","","13","","","22-24 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The deployment of sensor nodes in an optimal arrangement while overcoming the unique challenges posed by the surrounding medium and energy constraints on the sensors is a non-trivial task for real-world applications. As these characteristics are anisotropic with respect to change in temperature, salinity, depth, pH, and transmission frequency, they need to be accounted for in a dynamic simulation to preconfigure a stable physical network layout of nodes. A strategy based on computational intelligence techniques that takes into consideration these factors to achieve a viable configuration with the available resources is of prime importance. The proposed methodology uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique for the positioning and deployment of UWSN nodes to maximize the coverage provided to protect a high-value asset (HVA) in a military application. In the case of a civil application for ocean monitoring, the proposed technique is used to identify the minimum number of nodes required and their positions for effective communication.","","978-1-4799-8299-8","","10.1109/UT.2015.7108229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7108229","deployment strategy;genetic algorithm;modeling;simulation;underwater acoustic sensor network","Genetic algorithms;Monitoring;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Temperature sensors;Three-dimensional displays","genetic algorithms;oceanographic techniques;pH;sensor placement;telecommunication power management;underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks","HVA;UWSN;computational intelligence techniques;energy constraints;genetic algorithm;high-value asset;ocean monitoring;physical network layout;sensor nodes;transmission frequency;underwater acoustic sensor networks;underwater sensor network positioning;wireless operation","","0","","21","","","23-25 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution. We describe the measurement setup, and provide detailed evaluation results of the algorithms used.

In a large monitoring environment where targets are distributed over an entire monitored region, deploying static sensors leads to high hardware costs because a high number of sensors may be required to achieve network connectivity. This paper considers the target-patrol issue where a set of mobile data mules (DMs) are dispatched to efficiently patrol the given targets under a predefined time constraint. The targets are assigned weights indicating their importance, where more important targets should be visited more frequently by the DMs. Accordingly, this paper proposes a time-constrained weighted targets patrolling (TCWTP) algorithm for locally constructing efficient patrol paths, thereby ensuring globally stable intervals between visits to all target points. A performance analysis revealed that the proposed TCWTP mechanism outperforms existing works in terms of the average interval between visits, quality of monitoring satisfaction ratio, and monitoring fairness ratio.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2014.2378212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000577","Data collection;sweep coverage;target coverage;target {coverage};weighted target patrolling;wireless mobile sensor networks (WMSNs);wireless mobile sensor {networks} (WMSNs)","Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Mobile communication;Monitoring;Time factors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile communication;wireless sensor networks","DM;TCWTP algorithm;deploying static sensors;mobile data mules;monitored region;monitoring environment;monitoring fairness ratio;monitoring satisfaction ratio;time constrained weighted targets patrolling;time constrained weighted targets patrolling mechanism;wireless mobile sensor networks","","0","","31","","2014-12-31","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A masquerade attack is a form of attack wherein the attacker uses someone else's identity or one system assumes the identity of another system. One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine.","","1-4244-1304-4","1-4244-1304-4","10.1109/IAW.2007.381943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267571","GUI usage;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;profiling","Conferences;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Manipulator dynamics;Mice;Operating systems;Real time systems;Tellurium","graphical user interfaces;security of data","GUI usage analysis;graphical user interface;masquerade attack;masquerade detection","","2","","11","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This renders the fixing of these potential faults slow and expensive. This paper proposes a system which can analyse data received from a surveillance system. The proposed system will report abnormal activities, such as malfunctioning or dead sensors, abnormal usage, and abnormal events created by the surveillance system. The experimental evaluation is performed by using six cases describing different types of abnormal activity. The experiments indicate that the proposed system can effectively pinpoint faulty sensors and other abnormal activities.

In this paper, we propose an evasion technique to the Snort NIDS which exploits its flowbits feature. We specify the flowbit evasion attack and provide practical algorithms to solve it with controllable false positives and formally prove their correctness and completeness. We implemented a tool called SFET which can automatically parse a Snort rule set, generate all possible sequences that can evade it, as well as produce a patch to guard the rule set against those evasions. Although Snort was used for illustration, both the evasion attack and the solution to it are applicable to any stateful signature-based NIDS.","1542-1201","978-1-4673-0267-8","978-1-4673-0268-5","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211918","","Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;IP networks;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;transport protocols","Achilles heel;IP fragmentation;NIDS evasion techniques;SFET;SNORT flowbits;TCP segmentation;application protocol;flowbit evasion attack;multistage attack detection;packet sequence;signature-based network intrusion detection systems;snort rule set","","0","","24","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, the detection templates should be modified online, and a template-adjustable adaptive decision fusion algorithm is proposed. There are two benefits in the TAIDS. First, when it is difficult to distinguish current behaviors depending on familiar features, The TAIDS will discriminate them by means of danger theory, making false alarms reduced and the ability of identifying novel attacks enhanced. Second, the adaptive decision templates algorithm allows detection templates to modify dynamically without periodical updating. Experiments are carried out on KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this system.

To apply this approach, home service robots could be more intelligent in the adaptation.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779039","Autonomie Computing;Home Service Robot;Intelligent system;Self-Adaptive System;Smart Control System","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Control systems;Runtime;Service robots;Software","adaptive control;intelligent control;service robots","CPS;computing elements;home service robot;household affairs;household chores;self-adaptive system development method;smart control systems;smart machinery;user satisfaction","","0","","11","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It determines whether incoming traffic matches a database of signatures up to payload level, where each signature represents an attack, vulnerability, Virus, worm and even type of traffic. Other techniques like IDS/IPS etc uses only packet header information for decision making, while DPI is considers whole packet including payload for matching which provides better surveillance then other techniques. The problems that DPI system faces is low packet throughput, high memory requirement, latency and low accuracy at line speed of 10GbE/OC192. This paper reviews different software based approaches for efficient implementation of Deep Packet Inspection. A comparative study has been performed for these approaches on the basis of packet throughput and memory requirements. This paper is an attempt to exhaustively review existing techniques to addresses the probable research gaps.

The privacy of users is of paramount importance to administrators and organizations, which are reluctant to cooperate between each other and exchange network traffic traces. The main reasons behind reluctance to exchange monitored data are the protection of the users' privacy and the fear of information leakage about the internal infrastructure. Anonymization is the technique to overcome this reluctance and enhance the cooperation between different organizations with the smooth exchange of monitored data. Today, several organizations provide network traffic traces that are anonymized by software utilities or ad-hoc solutions that offer limited flexibility. The result of this approach is the creation of unrealistic traces, inappropriate for use in evaluation experiments. Furthermore, the need for fast on-line anonymization has recently emerged as cooperative defense mechanisms have to share network traffic. Our effort focuses on the design and implementation of a generic and flexible anonymization framework that provides extended functionality, covering multiple aspects of anonymization needs and allowing fine-tuning of privacy protection level. The proposed framework is composed by an anonymization application programming interface (AAPI). The performance results show that AAPI outperforms existing tools, while offering significantly more anonymization primitives.","8164-9547","1-4244-0355-3","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024508","","Computer science;Credit cards;Data privacy;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power system security;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Web pages","","","","7","","25","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have developed an algorithm that tracks multiple (n) characteristics per flow, and requires updating only the flow's n values upon an event, not all the values for all the flows. The n correlation values are used as coordinates for a point in n-space; two flows are considered correlated if there is a very small Euclidean distance between them.

The (trustworthy) requirements of the system must be formally specified by an expert who has sufficient knowledge about the behaviour of the system. The reengineered model of the system and the requirement descriptions are then processed by an off-the-shelf model checker.

The security of wireless sensor networks is a big concern. Hence for secure communication it is important to detect and prevent the attacks in network. Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network. Security algorithm for wireless sensor networks such as CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is used for secure communication. The CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is an advanced cryptography method which is used for encryption and decryption process to provide special security.

Sinkhole attack is the most destructive routing attack for these networks, it enable many other attack. In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack. The algorithm detects sinkhole node by finding the difference of nodes sequence numbers using threshold value. It also shows performance evaluation of AODV with the enhanced secure routing algorithm and existing secure routing algorithm through simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm by considering performance metrics as Throughput, PDR and Packet loss.

Accordingly, intrusion detectors generate tons of alerts that may signify realistic and false attacks. Most often, failed attacks are erroneously predicted and processed while classification trees that should have given detail descriptions of each clusters of the attacks are poorly constructed. This is because the qualities of clustering schemes that are generated are not evaluated with an appropriate model. Consequently, attacks in progress are not forestalled despite alerts that intrusion detectors generate beforehand. Therefore, this paper presents category utility paradigm for showing a good way of using clustering algorithm to partition audit trails. Series of evaluations showed how to adopt guessing strategy to improve the efficacy of intrusion detections.","","978-1-4244-9029-5","","10.1109/CEEC.2010.5606488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5606488","Overlapping cluster;failed attacks;intrusion detection system","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Prediction algorithms","computer network security;pattern classification;pattern clustering;trees (mathematics)","classification trees;clustering algorithm;computer attack;guessing strategy;intrusion detection;policy enforcers;utility paradigm","","1","","14","","","8-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach is an enhancement to our previous work, which was based on the principle of negative selection for generating anomaly detectors using genetic algorithms. The present work includes a different genetic representation scheme for evolving efficient fuzzy detectors. To determine the performance of the proposed approach, which is named Evolving Fuzzy Rule Detectors (EFR), experiments were conducted with three different data sets. One data set contains wireless data, generated using network simulator (NS2) while the other two data sets are publicly available (from Lincoln Lab). Results exhibited that the proposed approach outperformed the previous techniques.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232430","","Artificial immune systems;Character generation;Computer networks;Computer science;Detectors;Fuzzy sets;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Shape;Telecommunication traffic","computer crime;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;wireless LAN","EFR;Evolving Fuzzy Rules Detectors;Lincoln lab data set;NS2 network simulator;cyber attack detection;evolutionary approach;fuzzy anomaly signature generation;genetic algorithm;genetic representation scheme;wireless data","","10","","22","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

QRS detection provides the fundamentals for almost all automated ECG analysis algorithms. We proposed a novel method for detection of QRS complexes in ECG signals using Network Intrusion Detection technique used for detection of worm in networking applications for finding the frequently repeated strings in a packet stream. A novel real-time QRS detection technique using two-phase hashing is proposed in this paper. Our technique relies more on the data stream corresponding to ECG beats than any particular feature. We use the concept of shared counters to minimize the memory requirement while efficiently shifting through suspicious strings. The algorithm automatically adjusts parameters periodically to adapt to ECG changes as QRS morphology and heart rate. The proposed algorithm correctly detects QRS complexes with negligible false positive and negative detection.","","978-1-4799-6084-2","","10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226131","QRS complex;hashing;repeated binary strings;shared counters","Electrocardiography;Indexes;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Robustness","bioelectric potentials;electrocardiography;medical signal detection;medical signal processing","ECG signal detection;automated ECG analysis algorithms;data stream;electrocardiogram;heart rate;network intrusion detection technique;real-time QRS detection technique;two-phase hashing;worm detection","","0","","23","","","5-7 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they are of interest to adversaries and are susceptible to some types of attacks for they are deployed in unprotected environments. In this paper we use key feature and rule-based intrusions detection for WSNs. In our scheme, we investigate different defense rules and key features in WSNs to build efficient, accurate and effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs). We also propose a moving window function method to gather the current activity data. The scheme fits the demands and restrictions of WSNs. The scheme does not need any cooperation among other monitor nodes. Simulation results show that we proposed IDSs is efficient and accurate.","","978-0-7695-2943-1","","10.1109/NPC.2007.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4351479","","Ad hoc networks;Application software;Communication system security;Computer science;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Parallel processing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","public key cryptography;wireless sensor networks","key feature-rule-based intrusion detection systems;monitor nodes;moving window function method;wireless sensor networks","","0","","15","","","18-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
