Different software testing techniques are used during pre-deployment phase of the software. But, these do not ensure that all possible behaviors of implementation are analyzed, executed and tested. Because of the incomplete assurance from the testing methodology, software can sometimes behave very differently during the post-deployment phase. This is termed as software anomaly and they are caused mostly by external attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, path-traversal attack, etc. To detect such anomalies and to ensure the security and reliability of software during the post-deployment phase, a technique known as runtime monitoring can be used. This paper presents a framework for the development of runtime monitors to accomplish post-deployment monitoring of software to detect and prevent path traversal attack.","","978-1-4673-1937-9","","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297163","","Games;Java;Monitoring;Runtime;Security;Software;Testing","SQL;program testing;security of data;software performance evaluation;software reliability;system monitoring","SQL injection;cross-site scripting;external attacks;path traversal attack prevention;path-traversal attack;postdeployment software monitoring;runtime monitoring;runtime monitors;software anomaly;software postdeployment phase;software predeployment phase;software reliability;software security;software testing techniques","","1","","25","","","12-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two intrusion detection methods: namely misuse- and anomaly-based. A collaborative intelligent intrusion detection system (CIIDS) is proposed to include both methods, since it is concluded from recent research that the performance of an individual detection engine is rarely satisfactory. In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts. At the end of the review, the paper suggests fuzzy logic and other AI techniques to be exploited to reduce the rate of false alarms while keeping the detection rate high.

Port scanning is one of the dangerous attacks that intrusion detection tries to detect. Snort, a famous network intrusion detection system (NIDS), detects a port scanning attack by combining and analyzing various traffic parameters. Because these parameters cannot be easily combined using a mathematical formula, fuzzy logic can be used to combine them; fuzzy logic can also reduce the number of false alarms. This paper presents a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, to detect port scanning attacks. A fuzzy logic controller is designed and integrated with Snort in order to enhance the functionality of port scanning detection. Experiments are carried out in both wired and wireless networks. The results show that applying fuzzy logic adds to the accuracy of determining bad traffic. Moreover, it gives a level of degree for each type of port scanning attack.","","978-1-4244-2201-2","978-1-4244-2202-9","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599918","","Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Engines;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Wireless networks","fuzzy control;security of data","fuzzy logic controller;network intrusion detection system;port scanning","","1","","16","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). It is common knowledge in the research community that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. In this paper we discuss this accuracy problem and decompose it into a detection problem and a confirmation problem. We then map the evaluation of this accuracy problem to the traditional software verification and validation problem, which allows us to analyze the techniques academics have been using to evaluate their IDS technologies. As a result, we are able to identify areas where research is needed to improve the assessment of the IDS accuracy problem through verification and validation techniques.","1071-9458","978-1-4673-4638-2","","10.1109/ISSRE.2012.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405405","Intrusion detection system;Network;Signature;Verification and Validation","Accuracy;Computers;Engines;Malware;Software;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer network security;digital signatures;formal verification;telecommunication traffic","IDS;antivirus systems;attack descriptions;computer network protection;firewalls;malicious behaviour;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic monitoring;signature based network;signature validation;signature verification","","0","","43","","","27-30 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Association rules is a popular technique to produce a quality misused detection. However, the weaknesses of association rules is the fact that it often produced with thousands rules which reduce the performance of IDS. This paper aims to show applying post-mining to reduce the number of rules and remaining the most quality rules to produce quality signature.

Each partition is mining using Apriori Algorithm, which later performing post-mining using Chi-Squared (χ<sup>2</sup>) computation techniques. The quality of rules is measured based on Chi-Square value, which calculated according the support, confidence and lift of each association rule.

As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications. Our work is focused on exploring the resistance of various machine learning algorithms to such an approach. In this paper we present an experimental framework designed to measure the susceptibility of anomaly detection algorithms to model drift. We also exhibit our preliminary results using various machine learning algorithms commonly found in intrusion detection research.","","978-1-4673-7556-6","","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208643","adversarial machine learning;cyber security;intrusion detection systems;model drift","Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Image color analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Security;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;security of data","anomaly detection algorithms;autonomous systems;data distribution;data driven approach;intrusion detection research;machine learning algorithms;machine learning techniques;model drift evaluation;on-line learning;periodic retraining;programming logic","","0","","19","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.","","978-1-84919-909-4","","10.1049/cp.2014.1285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816","Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen","","cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique","","0","","","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

These applications are themselves dependent on distributed information systems for all aspects of their operation and so survivability of the information systems is an important issue. Fault tolerance is a key mechanism by which survivability can be achieved in these information systems. Much of the literature on fault-tolerant distributed systems focuses on local error recovery by masking the effects of faults. We describe a direction for error recovery in the face of catastrophic faults, where the effects of the faults cannot be masked using available resources. The goal is to provide continued service that is either an alternate or degraded service by reconfiguring the system rather than masking faults.

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience. According to the simulation results, our proposed mechanism achieved similar video quality level compared with standard FEC, while reducing the transmission of redundant packets, which will bring many benefits in a resource-constrained system.","2160-4886","978-1-4673-1429-9","","10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379150","Forward error correction;Intrusion detection;Multi-tier architecture;QoE;Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Cameras;Forward error correction;Multimedia communication;Quality assessment;Redundancy;Streaming media;Video recording","forward error correction;image sequences;multimedia communication;quality of experience;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;video coding;wireless sensor networks","QoE-aware FEC mechanism;camera nodes;forward error correction;multimedia content transmission;multimedia intrusion detection;multitier WMSN;multitier network architecture;multitier wireless multimedia sensor networks;quality of experience-aware FEC mechanism;real-time video sequences;redundant packets;reliability;resource-constrained system;scalar sensors;ubiquitous systems;video quality level","","3","","25","","","8-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We introduce a new matching structure: a tree of DFAs where the DFA associated with a node over-approximates those at its children, and the DFAs at the leaves represent the signature set. Matching works top-down, starting at the root of the tree and stopping at the first node whose DFA does not match. In the common case (benign traffic) matching does not reach the leaves. DFA-trees are built using Compact Overapproximate DFAs (CODFAs). A CODFA D' for D over-approximates the language accepted by D, has a smaller number of states than D, and has a low false-match rate. Although built from approximate DFAs, DFA-trees perform exact matching faster than a commonly used method, have a low memory overhead and a guaranteed good worst case performance.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847977","","Approximation error;Automata;Computers;Conferences;DH-HEMTs;Payloads;Training","computational complexity;deterministic automata;digital signatures;finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;tree data structures","CODFAs;DFA-trees;IPSs;NP-hard problem;benign traffic matching;compact overapproximate DFAs;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;intrusion prevention system;low false-match rate;low memory overhead;matching structure;parametrized language overapproximation;regular expressions;state-explosion problem;vulnerability signatures","","1","","30","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cluster heads themselves are evaluated by the base station. We develop an analytical model based on stochastic Petri nets for performance evaluation of the proposed trust-based intrusion detection scheme, as well as a statistical method for calculating the false alarm probability.

The system can be configured such that the user response to this alert is used to undo the firewall updates and hence helps reduce the interruption of service resulting from false alarms.

In motion, malware may hide within the data payloads of legitimate AMI control traffic, implying the need for deep packet inspection.

Towards this end we propose a policy engine that examines both ingress and egress traffic to the AMI application layer. Policy engine rules may refer to the structure and behavior of the AMI protocol, and may also perform multi-stage analysis of data payloads looking for evidence that executable code is carried, rather than data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the policy engine is able to accurately distinguish between legitimate traffic and malware bearing traffic.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688003","","Encryption;Engines;Entropy;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","metering;power meters;power system security;protocols","AMI application layer;AMI control traffic;AMI protocol;advanced metering infrastructure;data payloads;deep packet inspection;malware propagation;multistage analysis;policy engine","","1","","25","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad Hoc networks are completely free from pre-existing infrastructure or authentication point so that all the present mobile nodes which are want to communicate with each other immediately form the topology and initiates the request for data packets to send or receive. For the security perspective, communication between mobile nodes via wireless links make these networks more susceptible to internal or external attacks because any one can join and move the network at any time. In general, Packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s) is one of the possible attack in the mobile ad hoc network. This paper emphasized to develop an intrusion detection system using fuzzy Logic to detect the packet dropping attack from the mobile ad hoc networks and also remove the malicious nodes in order to save the resources of mobile nodes. For the implementation point of view Qualnet simulator 6.1 and Mamdani fuzzy inference system are used to analyze the results.

In this paper, a new intrusion detection method has been introduced using MinMax K-means clustering algorithm, which overcomes the shortage of sensitivity to initial centers in K-means algorithm, and increases the quality of clustering.

In this paper, we propose a novel packet classification algorithm named DBS (discrete bit selection) which takes a bit level heuristic design to partition the rule set effectively. To the best of our knowledge, DBS is the first try to design a heuristic classification algorithm at bit-level. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, DBS is deployed on a popular multi-core network processor platform, compared with two existing well-known algorithms. Experimental results show that DBS achieves 300% higher throughput than HiCuts and HSM, while the memory requirement is reduced to about 10% averagely.

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response.

Understanding how and why spoofing attacks are used, combined with a few simple prevention methods, can help protect your network from these malicious cloaking and cracking techniques.. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used to secure these environments for sharing their data over network and host based IDS approaches. The rapid improvements of intrusions in internet and other networks are the main factors responsible for the propagation of different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing environment. Now a days the Ids makes use of the signature based detection approach which detects the actions based on analyzing the patterns such as text, password, time etc. So this will create difficulties in updating information and detecting unknown attacks. In this paper we make use of an improved EADS (Exception Agent Detection System) for making the header information secure. Packet filtering is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. In this paper, we also propose an inter-domain packet_filter (IDPF) architecture that can mitigate the level of IP spoofing on the Interne together with the IDS. We establish the conditions under which the IDPF framework works correctly in that it does not discard packets with valid source addresses. In this paper we propose an improved behavioral method for combating the unknown threats other tha- the usual context and content scanning techniques.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738791","Exception agent system;IP spoofing;Intrusion detection system;Local area network;packet filter","Computer architecture;Computer science;Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Intrusion detection","IP networks;Internet;digital signatures;security of data","IP spoofing attack;Internet;TCP/IP network;content scanning techniques;cracking techniques;exception agent detection system;interdomain packet filter architecture;intrusion detection system;malicious cloaking;packet filtering;signature based detection","","1","","12","","","27-29 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each new proposal and technique arrives with great promise and anticipated success as research teams struggle to develop new and innovative responses to emerging threats. Unfortunately, these techniques frequently fall short of expectation when deployed due to difficulties with false alarms, trouble operating in a non-idealized or new domain, or flexibility limiting assumptions which are only valid with specific input sets. We believe these failures are due to fundamental problems with the experimental method for evaluating the effectiveness of new ideas and techniques. This work explores the effect of a poorly understood data synthesis process on the evaluation of IA devices. The point of an evaluation is to independently determine what a detector can and cannot detect, i.e. the metric of detection. This can only be done when the data contains carefully controlled ground truth. We broadly define the term “similarity class” to facilitate discussion about the different ways data (and more specifically test data) can be similar, and use these ideas to illustrate the pre-requisites for correct evaluation of anomaly detectors. We focus on how anomaly detectors function and should be evaluated in 2 specific domains with disparate system architectures and data: a sensor and data transport network for air frame tracking and display, and a deep space mission spacecraft command link. Finally, we present empirical evidence illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in these domains, and introduce the entropy of a time series sensor as a critical measure of data similarity for test data in these domains.","","978-1-4244-6047-2","","10.1109/THS.2010.5655105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655105","data generation;experimental method;information assurance;similarity classes","Detectors;Entropy;Generators;Markov processes;Measurement;Radar tracking;Space vehicles","aerospace computing;data handling;security of data","IA devices;air frame tracking;anomaly detector;data synthesis process;data transport network;information assurance technique","","0","","16","","","8-10 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks are gaining popularity because of the availability of low cost mobile devices and its ability to provide instant wireless networking capabilities. MANET is an infrastructure less network and there is no central administration. The open medium, wide distribution of nodes, changing topology and no centralized monitoring makes MANETs vulnerable to malicious attackers. For these types of networks, security is the most essential service to provide protection and prevent malicious attacks occurring in the mobile nodes. Attackers can easily compromise MANETs by inserting malicious or non cooperative nodes into the network. To compensate MANET from these malicious activities in this paper, it is proposed a new intrusion detection & prevention algorithm named as Packet Dropping detection Algorithm (PDA). MANETs depends on the cooperation of nodes in the network for the forwarding of packets to the destination. The Cooperation requires detecting routes on the neighbor nodes. The cooperative node having malicious activity by the attacker may not forward or drops the packets, partially or fully. By PDA algorithm the neighbor nodes inform about the attacker by raising a global alarm and prevent an intruder from the malicious attacks in the network.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950037","PDA;detection;misbehaving node;packet dropping;prevention","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nominations and elections;Protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDA algorithm;PDA-misbehaving node detection;PDA-misbehaving node prevention;changing topology;cooperative node;intruder prevention;intrusion detection-prevention algorithm;low-cost mobile devices;malicious activity;malicious attack detection;malicious attack prevention;malicious attackers;malicious node;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;neighbor nodes;node cooperation;node distribution;noncooperative nodes;packet dropping detection algorithm;packet forwarding;route detection;wireless networking capabilities","","0","","10","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The present day security environment demands security mechanisms that rarely fail. In this paper we have tried to take a step further towards foolproof security. The present security measures are based on binary principle. The security mechanisms and procedures adopted at present make the software system strong up to a point and then fail catastrophically. In this paper we have tried to explore some innovative measures and proposed a new approach which will henceforth be named as “Secure Software System (SSS)”. Here we have tried to avert the failed state of the system by induction of `Fuzzy Logic'. This will help us to evolve intermediate stages between the safe state and failed state for security goals and resultant security level to be constantly monitored by actors associated with this arrangement. These actors will be prompt in taking additional countermeasures to strengthen the since applied mitigation policies for different threats before the attacker is successful in his mission. These measures will break the jinx of brittleness in between the two states which has gone unattended so far.","","978-1-4244-6347-3","","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5486061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486061","SSS;fuzzy logic;security requirementss;software agents;threat modeling","Capacitive sensors;Condition monitoring;Data security;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Pervasive computing;Risk management;Software agents;Software measurement;Software systems","fuzzy logic;risk management;security of data;software agents;software engineering;system recovery","binary based security mechanism;foolproof security;fuzzy logic;risk management;secure software system","","0","","28","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several recent works in this area concern strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from data are much denser (with the density over 90% versus about 40% density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end, a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the performance of the models generated by other methods.","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2182646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152163","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs)","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data models;Humans;Learning systems;Vectors","cognition;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","SRCGA method;density estimate;dynamic systems modeling;fully automated algorithms;fuzzy cognitive maps learning;maps formation;sparse real-coded genetic algorithms","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Fuzzy Logic;Models, Theoretical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","2","","49","","2012-02-14","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The natural traffic granularity is the flow between packet and circuit and between connection-less and connection-oriented modes. Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of “knowledge plane” and “network mining.”","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.20371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781206","","","","","","0","4","","","","Summer 2009","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

The proposed scheme is based on a logical ring architecture, which permits to alleviate the task of the group controller in maintaining the group key.

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cloud service providers foresee it as a source of promising financial gains, the clients find it a convenient solution where the enterprises may get started on their computing activities without investing on the in-house facilities of hardware and software. They can outsource the computing and archiving activities to the cloud service providers (CSP) though Internet. There are many dimensions of these activities and the researchers are trying to find acceptable solutions for the industry. In this paper, we have focused on the information security issues when migrating to a cloud environment. The confidence of end user can be won partially by the guarantees of service provider and use of cryptographic techniques. It is important that the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) should be included in the models which support forensic study whenever required. It is equally important to address the issue of anti-forensic methods that the service providers may use to hide their malicious activities. Therefore the clients would like to have a better, in-depth knowledge of information management at service providers' end. For this purpose tools to probe into the cloud services are required. To elaborate on this issue we have chosen the data archiving and storage model used for medical service providers and hospitals. It is a classic test-case where Patients' history has to be maintained under the guidelines of HIPPA. The Amazon security model has been reviewed for this purpose both for archiving and disaster recovery.

This approach is applied to Internet2 traffic measurements to evaluate the time duration and spatial spread (number of links affected) of anomalies. Based on the empirical results, a node model is proposed that captures the behavior of anomalies at individual network nodes. The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction. As extensions, the model is applied over a path and an aggregated model that applies to a neighborhood in the network is also presented. A method to use the graph wavelet components found during the analysis to implement a real-time anomaly monitoring system is also discussed.","0742-1303","978-1-4244-8387-7","","10.1109/LCN.2010.5735749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5735749","Graph wavelets;Internet traffic anomalies;Modeling network anomalies","Analytical models;Cities and towns;Discrete wavelet transforms;Internet;Probability distribution;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet coefficients","Internet;computer network security;graph theory;telecommunication traffic;wavelet transforms","Internet traffic anomaly;Internet2 traffic data;graph wavelet;network-wide anomaly;real-time anomaly monitoring system;spatial behavior;temporal behavior","","2","","24","","","10-14 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Efficiency of the intrusion prevention system is determined by pattern matching algorithm. A survey of the pattern matching algorithm is described in this thesis. The Wu-Manber algorithm which is one of the multi-pattern matching algorithm is explained in detail and the improvement of the Wu-Manber algorithm is presented to improve the efficiency. By dividing the pattern group into two subgroups and dealing with the two subgroups in different methods, the QWM algorithm enhanced the efficiency of pattern matching. Experimental results show that when pattern group contains a pattern that is less than three bytes, the performance of the improved Wu-Manber algorithm is much better than the traditional Wu-Manber algorithm.","","978-1-4244-6582-8","","10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5658784","BM algorithm;QWM Algorithm;Wu-Manber algorithm;intrusion detection system;multi-pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Safety","pattern matching;security of data","QWM algorithm;Wu-Manber algorithm;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention system;multiple pattern matching algorithm","","1","","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20070813","2007","","","1391","1398","A clear deficiency in most of todays anomaly intrusion detection systems (AIDS) is their inability to distinguish between a new form of legitimate normal behavior and a malicious attack based on known previous normal behaviors. This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288905","","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Communications Society;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Research initiatives","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;recurrent neural nets;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;generalization ability;machine learning techniques;malicious attack;recurrent neural networks;structural pattern recognition;temporal pattern processing","","0","","26","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we improve the system detection capability by allowing monitors to use information collected at different instants and thus realizing a dynamic state observer that is valid for any system in the considered class.

However, QoS is guaranteed through fulfillment of non-functional requirements like Security, Scalability, Mobility and Virtualization in Cloud computing System. In this paper we proposed ""the Open Cloud Security Architecture (OCSA) algorithm"" is an approach to fulfillment of our goal. To meet the computing demands of everyday operations like Nonfunctional requirements, here we have introduced OCSA to achieve that first security, the misuse case and Attack Tree analysis posed threat and Attack Surface of any Cloud, Second scalability to overcome network traffic congestion and Denial of Service (DoS) because of rapid growth of customers and Third, Storage and Service providing consequences arise and mitigated to achieve Mobility and Virtualization.

The evolution of attack and the increase of vulnerable hosts on the Internet, have made its improvement more varied and difficult to be detected in real time. Today's popular IP protocol development is IPv6. IPv6 provides a new technology including vulnerabilities and allows the attacker to attack the system. This issue may be the obstacle to make a DDOS attack detection algorithm more efficient and accurate. Due to that fact, this paper will discuss the development of prototype to detect DDOS attack using source addresses analytical methods and analysis of network flow. This prototype can detect DDOS attacks on IPv6 with 85% accuracy for the most severe test scenarios. For the detection time, the prototype can recognize DDOS within 2 minutes 56 seconds.","","","","10.1109/ICoICT.2015.7231429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7231429","DDOS detection;IPv6;hybrid;network flow;source address analysis","Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Prototypes","IP networks;computer network security","DDOS flooding attack detection;Distributed Denial of Service flooding attack detection;IPv6 network;Internet;computer network;network flow analysis;source addresses analytical method","","0","","12","","","27-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a system: TAICHI which combines heterogeneous intrusion detection systems with improved distributed firewall system (IDFS) to automatically detect and prevent intrusion originated from intranet or Internet. TAICHI can manage heterogeneous IDSs (intrusion detection systems) and firewalls with plugin, which makes it evolved easily to employ new detection technology and to integrate legacy firewall in an organization. ECA (extended common alert) in TAICHI can analyze alerts from heterogeneous IDSs. The system employs IDFS as a response subsystem, which could easily block attack originated from intranet or Internet. To configure heterogeneous firewalls efficiently, extended meta-firewall-rule configuration (EMFRC) was presented, which can not only configure firewall in a unified template, but also set special options of rules of different type with the same template. Due to EMFRC and IDFS, TAICHI makes the optimized strategy automatically to block intrusion from different network topology","","1-4244-0061-9","","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028035","Automatic intrusion response;Heterogeneous;Improved Distributed Firewall;extended meta-firewall-rule configuration","Access control;Communication system control;Computer hacking;Computer science;Control systems;Cybernetics;Delay;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Graphical user interfaces;Internet;Intrusion detection;Logic;Machine learning;Network topology;Protection;Technology management","Internet;authorisation;intranets;telecommunication security","Internet;automatic protection;distributed firewall system;intranet;intrusion detection system;meta-firewall-rule configuration;network topology;open intrusion automatic response system","","1","","21","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low cost VLSI fabrication, unbounded scalability, and high speed constant-rate throughput independent of pattern number and complexity breaks current trade space constraints.
