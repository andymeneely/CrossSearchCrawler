For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing NFA/DFA and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well on the important issues on multi-core architecture design, such as load balancing, data locality and communication between cores.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-7114-0","","10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560073","","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Multicore processing;Program processors","computer viruses;finite automata;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","attack signatures;data locality;deep packet inspection;hybrid regular expression matching;layer-7 filtering;load balancing;multicore architecture;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection;payload portion;space complexity;traffic monitoring;viruses","","3","1","27","","","2-5 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SMTP protocol lacks a mechanism for verifying the source of a message, and respective protocol extensions are still far from becoming standard. Content-based automatic spam filters are thus often used, and simple origin-based filtering techniques like black- and whitelists are also very common. In this paper we first analyze the retry behavior of Internet mail sources upon delivery errors. We then propose a novel spam filtering approach, founded on the results of this analysis. It is based on the observed reaction of a mail source host to temporary errors. Furthermore, evaluation results from the production use of our filter on real mail servers are given, underlining its very good performance in practice.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288925","","Electronic mail;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Postal services;Production;Throughput;Transport protocols;Unsolicited electronic mail;Web server","Internet;protocols;unsolicited e-mail","Internet;spam email filtering;unsolicited bulk email","","1","","13","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once sensor nodes are compromised, malicious nodes can send erroneous data to the base station, and possibly mislead monitoring results and influence the whole networks' effectiveness. We need to find new mechanisms to protect the wireless networks from attacks. In this paper we develop a scheme for malicious node detection based on weighted-trust evaluation. A weight value is assigned to each sensor node initially. It updates every cycle if the node sends different report from the others. A malicious node will be detected when its weight value is lower than a threshold value.

This technique is not suited to find the signatures of DDoS attack, which is formless. Also, DDoS is in general the combination of different forms of denial of service (DoS). As a result, it is difficult to find the exact signature of attack. Moreover, it is very difficult to distinguish the difference between an unusual high traffic which is caused by the attack, and the flash crowds which normally occur when a huge number of users use the target machine at the same time. In fact, this difference should only be observed from analyzing the data in the packet header. In this paper, we propose to discover the DDoS attacking signature by analyzing the TCP/IP packet header against the well defined rules and conditions, and distinguish the difference between normal and abnormal traffic. We here observe three groups or delegates of DDoS attacking, i.e., ICMP flood, UDP flood and TCP SYN flood, and present convincing preliminary experiments.","","0-7803-8593-4","","10.1109/ISCIT.2004.1412917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1412917","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Data analysis;Electronic mail;Floods;IP networks;Internet;Knowledge engineering;Protocols;TCPIP","computer networks;packet switching;quality of service;security of data;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","DDoS attacking signature;DoS;ICMP flood;TCP SYN flood;TCP/IP header;UDP flood;abnormal traffic;distributed denial of service detection;flash crowds;normal traffic;packet header data;protocol level traffic measurement analysis;target machine;traffic measurement analysis;unusual high traffic","","8","","25","","","26-29 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces.

To study these attacks, the honeypot must capture and log large amounts of data which are very difficult to process manually. So, the analysis of these logs has become a very difficult and time consuming task. To resolve this problem, several researchers have proposed the use of data mining techniques in order to classify logged traffic and extract useful information. In this paper, we present a data analysis tool for our Honeypot Router. This tool is based on data mining clustering. The main idea is to extract useful features from data captured by the Honeypot Router. These data will be then clustered by using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm in order to classify the captured packets and extract those that are suspicious. Suspicious packets will be then verified by a human expert. This solution is very useful to detect novel routing attacks.","","978-1-4244-7716-6","","10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5587041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587041","Clustering;Honeypot Router;data analysis;data mining;routing attack detection","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data analysis;Data mining;Feature extraction;Routing;Routing protocols","data analysis;data mining;security of data","Honeypot router;data analyzer;data mining;security tool","","2","","17","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rule - based mechanisms which are tedious and error prone.

In this paper, we have identified the limitations of the current techniques and propose a model for alert correlation that overcomes the shortcomings. An improved ""require/provide"" model is presented which established a cooperation between statistical and knowledge-based model, to achieve higher detection rate with the minimal false positives. A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs. The proposed model has been implemented in real-time and has successfully generated security events on establishing a correlation between attack signatures. The system has been evaluated to detect one of the most serious multi-stage attacks in cyber crime -- SQLIA (SQL Injection Attack). Typical SQLIA steps are analyzed within the realm of simulated malicious activities normally used by cyber criminals. The system has efficiently established a correlation in attack behaviors and has generated an attack map. The map can be used to discretely analyze the correlated attack activities which in other case may go undetected thus facilitating the multi-stage attack recognition process.","1550-445X","978-1-61284-313-1","978-0-7695-4337-6","10.1109/AINA.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763386","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;SQL Injection;multi-stage attac","Correlation;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Mars;Probabilistic logic;Real time systems;Security","SQL;security of data;statistical analysis","SQL injection attack;SQLI activities;attack signatures;cyber crime;event based alert correlation system;knowledge based model;rule based mechanisms;statistical modeling","","0","","24","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An effective network-based Intrusion Detection using Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm augmented with near-deterministic detector generation","Senhua Yu; Dasgupta, D.","Dept. of Comput.

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The strategy significantly cuts down the effective memory access latencies and efficiently utilizes the memory bandwidth. Also, it maximizes the effects of the multithreading capability of the GPU through optimal thread scheduling.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection scheme based on a learning process, so that the training data can be updated at particular time intervals. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique compared to conventional schemes","","0-7803-9465-8","","10.1109/MAHSS.2005.1542870","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542870","","Cryptography;Disaster management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Protection;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Training data","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;infrastructure-type wireless networks;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network topology;self adaptive intrusion detection","","3","","26","","","7-7 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Essential to every network intrusion prevention system is the ability to search through packets and identify patterns that match known attacks. Resource- and time-efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at the line rate. Recently these systems have become a target of attacks - the example is the infamous Witty worm. The devices which use algorithms with low worst-case performance could be a target of algorithmic complexity attacks. For example, poorly prepared hash tables can degenerate to linked lists with carefully chosen input. An attacker can effectively compute an input data that will diminish the device throughput. This can lead to denial of service attacks, which are very dangerous for networks and computational environments. In this article new hardware implementation architecture of the Karp-Rabin algorithm was introduced. The result is a software, which generates a pattern matching module that could be easily used to create intrusion prevention systems implemented in reconfigurable hardware. The prepared module matches the subset of the Snort IPS signatures achieving throughput of over 2 Gbps and have the worst-case performance similar to the best-case one. This means that the presented implementation architecture is immune to algorithmic complexity attacks","","0-7695-2565-2","","10.1109/DEPCOS-RELCOMEX.2006.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024042","","Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer networks;Databases;Engines;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","cryptography;invasive software;string matching","IT security safeguards;Karp-Rabin algorithm;Snort IPS signatures;Witty worm;algorithmic complexity attacks;denial of service attacks;hash tables;network intrusion prevention system;pattern matching;reconfigurable hardware;resource-efficient string matching algorithm;time-efficient string matching algorithm","","4","1","28","","","25-27 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application. A proprietary medium access control is developed based on the low-power SimpliciTI radio stack. Network performance is assessed by experimental measurements using a test-bed operating at 868MHz in an indoor office environment with severe multipath and non line-of-sight propagation conditions.","","978-1-4673-0681-2","","10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215493","","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors;Synchronization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;alarm systems;indoor communication;safety systems;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","M2M networks;SimpliciTI radio stack;frequency 868 MHz;indoor intrusion detection;medium access control;multipath propagation;nonline-of-sight propagation;periodic low power monitoring service;protocol design;real time alarm propagation mechanism;smart surveillance;wireless machine-to-machine;wireless network prototype;wireless networks","","0","","14","","","1-1 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This sensor evolved from the technology of ldquoGUIDARrdquo pioneered in the 1970's to bring intrusion location to perimeter sensors. OmniTrax theory of operation, based on a unique application of new Ultra Wideband Radar was described, as well as its feature of allowing pinpoint location of intrusions along 800m of sensor cable using a single processor. This feature is fundamentally important to direct the response force, and also for rapid debug and maintenance of the installation. Since that first presentation the sensor has been fully realized as one of the most cost-effective ranging perimeter sensors with its own integrated power and communications network. It has also been evaluated for both detection and environmental performance at our own local test site (SITE), and at independent government sensor test agencies. Further components of the technology have been developed to enlarge the range of site applications. This paper provides an update on the technology and its application including some new applications for leaky coaxial cable technology. One such new application has been selected for more detailed discussion in the paper entitled ldquoA Rapid Deployment Guided Radar Sensorrdquo that also appears in these proceedings.","","978-1-4244-4169-3","978-1-4244-4170-9","10.1109/CCST.2009.5335537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5335537","","Acoustic sensors;Cable TV;Coaxial cables;Military aircraft;Narrowband;Radar detection;Radiofrequency interference;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Testing","coaxial cables;sensors;ultra wideband radar","2004 International Carnahan Conference;GUIDAR;OmniTrax theory;communications network;intrusion detection system;intrusion location;omnitrax ranging leaky coaxial cable sensor technology update;perimeter sensors;pinpoint location;power network;response force;ultra wideband radar","","5","","3","","","5-8 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Distributed monitoring of conditional entropy for anomaly detection in streams","Arackaparambil, C.; Bratus, S.; Brody, J.; Shubina, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum (IPDPSW), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on","20100524","2010","","","1","8","In this work we consider the problem of monitoring information streams for anomalies in a scalable and efficient manner. We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","5","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firewall along is not able to protect the system from being attacked through normal service channel. Furthermore, most of the current intrusion detection system focuses on the border of organization network. If the attack comes from inside, this setup does not provide any protection to hosts in the local network and the network itself. Therefore, we need to use other mechanism to protect the critical system as well as the network itself.

Using these systems, it is difficult to understand the source of attack, the diffusion of the attack, or the relation between the target and the source of the attack. This paper described a method for visualizing cyber threats by using 2-dimensional matrix representation of IP addresses. The advantages of this method are that: (I) the logical distance of IP addresses is represented intuitively, (2) Internet address space is visualized economically, (3) macroscopic information (site level) and microscopic information (local level) are visualized simultaneously.

Work on formalizing trust dates back to the mid-nineties, while work on formalizing privacy is in its infancy. The two concepts have a number of similarities including considerations of information type and sensitivity to inform actions, relationship between the communicating parties, and the context or purpose for communication. There are some key differences. Privacy, unlike trust, is legislated. In Canada, there are also a number of regulations, directives and policies that come along with the legislation. Trust, on the other hand, is the Wild West; almost anything goes. Early attempts at formalizing privacy have been largely restricted to P3P initiatives and other policy developments. Not only have they been largely ignored by the user community, but also because of the limited scope in application seem to fail to actually enable privacy protection. On the other hand, early trust models have taken a different approach. Instead, using a natural science approach and artificial agents, trust is circumscribed, simple and most importantly - repeatable. In the context of failed attempts at formalizing privacy through policy, learnings from trust can be utilized to advance the computational notion of privacy protection. This paper takes the work on formalizing privacy in a much needed new direction by examining the potential of an appropriate and applicable framework for privacy based on extant trust formalizations. It proposes a formalization for privacy can be based on trust, and would outline the types of privacy, examine privacy based decision-making, and explore the applicability of the agents as appropriate representations of people in the computational environment.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593227","privacy;trust","Computational modeling;Data privacy;Law;Legislation;Ontologies;Privacy;Social network services","security of data","privacy formalizations;trust formalizations;vampire bats","","1","","29","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The circular sequences of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process is replaced by circular body, then, a little data is extracted from normal system call sequences, and is transformed to decisive table, afterward, the decisive table is reduced and the simplest rules that present normal behavior mode is extracted by rough sets theory. These rules can be used to detect anomalous behavior. In order to realize the quick detection of known intrusion, an engine of quick detection inspired by hidden markov model was presented in this paper. Compared with other methods in the literature, the method presented in this paper is not only able to extract a set of effective detection rules with the minimum size from part of records of system call sequences, but also can detect the known intrusion quickly.

To solve this problem, a technique called frequent episode rules (FERs) base on data mining has been introduced into anomaly detection system (ADS). These episode rules are used to distinguish anomalous sequences of TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections from normal traffic episodes. Unfortunately, this technique is so depend on the machine learning that we may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal traffic data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for Internet anomaly detection with weighted fuzzy matching over frequent episode rules. We use weighted fuzzy matching algorithm to match the rules, though machine learning may not cover all the normal traffic. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the detection performance of the ADS, where only pure frequent episode rule is used.","","978-1-4244-3427-5","978-1-4244-3426-8","10.1109/ICACIA.2008.4770028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770028","Anomaly detection;Frequent episode rule;Internet security;Traffic data mining;weighted fuzzy matching","Association rules;Data mining;Data security;Databases;Face detection;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Web and internet services","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet anomaly detection;Internet security;data mining;frequent episode rules;machine learning;network intrusion;weighted fuzzy matching algorithm","","0","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several such metrics have been proposed, but their quality has not been studied. This paper presents a statistical analysis of how 18 security estimation metrics based on CVSS data correlate with the time-to-compromise of 34 successful attacks. The empirical data originates from an international cyber defense exercise involving over 100 participants and were collected by studying network traffic logs, attacker logs, observer logs, and network vulnerabilities. The results suggest that security modeling with CVSS data alone does not accurately portray the time-to-compromise of a system. However, results also show that metrics employing more CVSS data are more correlated with time-to-compromise. As a consequence, models that only use the weakest link (most severe vulnerability) to compose a metric are less promising than those that consider all vulnerabilities.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6259801","Network-level security and protection;network management;phreaking);risk management;unauthorized access (hacking","Authorization;Computational modeling;Computer crime;Mathematical model;Network security;Risk management;Telecommunication network management","security of data;statistical analysis","CVSS data;NVD;US National Vulnerability Database;attacker logs;common vulnerability scoring system;computer systems;empirical analysis;international cyber defense exercise;network traffic logs;network vulnerabilities;observer logs;security vulnerabilities;statistical analysis;system-level vulnerability metrics;time-to-compromise","","5","","46","","2012-08-03","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SigSectrade, an intrusion detection system under development, is intended to help detect and protect against attacks and is based on the premise that the GMPLS management, signaling and routing protocols are similar to programming languages. A protocol can be compared to a language definition: it contains a vocabulary, syntax definition and semantics. Like any computer language the protocol language must be unambiguous. The protocol specifies the behavior of concurrently executing processes. This concurrency creates a new class of subtle issues. One technique to address these issues is the finite state machine (FSM). SigSec captures the signaling protocol messages and forwards them to the appropriate protocol analyzer in addition to saving them to a database. SigSec performs intrusion detection through multiple layers of checks and verifications. SigSec detects many known attacks that may pass through semantic and syntax analyzers. Results of the security attack profile analysis indicate that SigSec is capable of protecting the control plane against any number of attack profiles.","","1-4244-1216-1","1-4244-1216-1","10.1109/ICNSURV.2007.384158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272190","","Automata;Bandwidth;Computer languages;Concurrent computing;Intrusion detection;Multiprotocol label switching;Protection;Routing protocols;Signal analysis;Vocabulary","multiprotocol label switching;routing protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security","SigSec;computer language;control plane protocols;finite state machine;generalized multiple protocol label switching;intrusion detection;language definition;non-conformance;protocol analyzer;routing protocols;security attack profile analysis;semantic analyzers;semantics;signaling protocols;switching networks;syntax definition;trusted behaviors","","1","","11","","","April 30 2007-May 3 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper focuses on the special case where video is protected by Forward Error Correction mechanisms, which allow reordering of the original packet sequence after it may have been altered by network impairments. Various Forward Error Correction mechanisms are applied in the presence of a network intrusion detection system and its impact on the resulting video quality is investigated.","2156-7190","978-1-4244-8150-7","978-0-7695-4185-3","10.1109/INTERNET.2010.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616479","network intrusion detection systems;video quality","","computer network security;data compression;forward error correction;invasive software","FEC-protected uncompressed video transmissions;delay variations;forward error correction;multimedia services;original packet sequence;security devices;software-based NIDS;software-based network intrusion detection system;video quality","","0","","11","","","20-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we conduct a complex experiment to expand our understanding of forensics analysis processes. During a period of four weeks we systematically investigated 200 detected security incidents about compromised hosts within a large operational network. We used data from four commonly-used security sources, namely Snort alerts, reconnaissance and vulnerability scanners, blacklists, and a search engine, to manually investigate these incidents. Based on our experiment, we first evaluate the (complementary) utility of the four security data sources and surprisingly find that the search engine provided useful evidence for diagnosing many more incidents than more traditional security sources, i.e., blacklists, reconnaissance and vulnerability reports. Based on our validation, we then identify and make available a list of 138 good Snort signatures, i.e., signatures that were effective in identifying validated malware without producing false positives. In addition, we compare the characteristics of good and regular signatures and highlight a number of differences. For example, we observe that good signatures check on average 2.14 times more bytes and 2.3 times more fields than regular signatures. Our analysis of Snort signatures is essential not only for configuring Snort, but also for establishing best practices and for teaching how to write new IDS signatures.","","978-1-4799-0458-7","","10.1109/SPW.2013.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565238","IDS;Infections;Malware;Network forensics","Correlators;Forensics;Malware;Manuals;Reconnaissance;Search engines","digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software;search engines","IDS signatures;Snort alerts;Snort signatures;blacklists;evidence collection;evidence correlation;malware;network forensics analysis;operational environment;reconnaissance;search engine;security data sources;security incident manual forensics investigation;vulnerability scanners","","3","","25","","","23-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are some challenges for implementing a full-scale carrier SDN. One of the most important challenges is SDN security, which is beginning to receive attention. With new SDN architecture, some security threats are common to traditional networking, but the profile of these threats (including their likelihood and impact and hence their overall risk level) changes. Moreover, there are some new security challenges such as bypassing predefined mandatory policies by overwriting flow entries and data eavesdropping by inserting fraudulent flow entries. This paper is to design open-flow specific security solutions and propose a comprehensive security architecture to provide security services such as enforcing mandatory network policy correctly and receiving network policy securely for SDN in order to solve these common security issues and new security challenges. It can also help the developers to implement security functions to provide security services when developing the SDN controller.","","","","10.1109/ICIN.2015.7073803","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073803","SDN;Security Architecture","Authorization;Communication networks;Control systems;Monitoring;Protocols;Transportation","data communication;software radio;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","SDN architecture;SDN controller;SDN security;comprehensive security architecture;data eavesdropping;fraudulent flow entries;mandatory policies;network-wide traffic flow;security architecture;security functions;security issues;security services","","0","","19","","","17-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenge is that one cannot predict the attack mechanism that will cause the modified behavior or when and how the target's behavior will diverge. Thus, if one restricts one's sensors to a particular aspect of the system or looks for specific malicious behavior, one is likely to miss the attack. This paper describes an approach for simultaneously examining multiple network and host abstraction layers to discover anomalous behavior and then correlating anomalies to determine whether an attack is taking place and, when applicable, select an automatic response. We have used this approach to implement host-based and network-based intrusion detection systems, HIDAR and NIDAR, for enterprise networks, as well as sister systems for tactical networks.

Our AEC includes two stages: the online stage and the offline stage, and three phases: classifier updating, ensemble classifiers reconstruction and component classifier subset selection for final decision. We take a new online bagging classification model that is based on incremental learner such as Naive Bayes classifier and can keep enough history information and create good diversity between different component classifiers. Then we take an offline scheme to do the ensemble reconstruction and ensemble subset selection: that is to drop certain number of classifiers periodically and use only a portion of the whole ensemble, the combination of which may yield better accuracy to make classification.

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors a network for precisely this purpose. IDSs fall into one of two categories: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Whereas signature-based IDSs rely upon pre-programmed matching rules designed by security experts and are therefore limited to pre-existing attacks in their coverage, anomaly-based IDSs attempt to identify normal and abnormal traffic, generally using machine learning, and therefore hold the promise of being able to identify novel attacks. Anomaly-based IDSs can be divided into IDSs that are trained online and IDSs that are trained offline. While IDSs that are trained online allow greater flexibility, such IDSs could be trained by an adversary to allow specific attacks. This work-in-progress paper proposes a methodology for protecting against the mistraining of an IDS trained online. Two IDSs begin with identical rule sets, but one is allowed to adjust its data to include online data while the other remains static. Both systems can report anomalies, and if the online IDS attempts to let through too much that the offline IDS does not, the decision boundaries of the online IDS are adjusted as a safeguard against mistraining. An experiment for testing the approach is proposed.","","978-1-4799-5068-3","","10.1109/SERVICES.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903245","information security;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms","Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Training data","cloud computing;digital signatures","anomaly-based IDS;cloud networks;ensemble systems;intrusion detection system;security;signature-based IDS","","0","","9","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20060123","2005","3","","6 pp.","","Fast virus scanning is becoming increasingly important in today's Internet. While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning ""booster"" technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of ""no-match"" cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of ""bad but cheap"" hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for ""on-access"" virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user. Through intercepting system calls and wrapping glibc libraries, we have implemented an ""on-access"" version for Hash-AV+Clam-AV. The on-access scanner can examine input data at a throughput of over 200 Mb/s, making it suitable for network-based virus scanning.","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577953","","Application software;Central Processing Unit;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Viruses (medical)","Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;filtering theory","CPU cycle speed;CPU second-level caches;Clam-AV;Hash-AV;Internet;bloom filter array;cache-resident filters;fast virus signature scanning;glibc libraries wrapping;hash functions;on-access scanner;open-source virus scanner;random memory accesses;system calls interception","","12","7","25","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud. Our framework, known as TrustCloud, contains a suite of techniques that address cloud security, trust and accountability from a detective approach at all levels of granularity.

Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, based on frequency patterns (FP) and tree patterns (TP) for intrusion detection respectively. FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to quickly find out frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences.","","978-1-4244-2113-8","978-1-4244-2114-5","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593135","Frequency pattern (FP);Information security;Intrusion Detection;System-call sequence;Tree pattern (TP)","Aquaculture;Automation;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intelligent control;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","data mining;security of data","FP;TP;computer intrusions;computer system;frequency patterns;information security;intrusion detection;operating system;sequential mining;short sequence model;system-call sequences;tree patterns","","1","","14","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"SIMD parallelization of applications that traverse irregular data structures","Ren, B.; Agrawal, G.; Larus, J.R.; Mytkowicz, T.; Poutanen, T.; Schulte, W.","Dept. of Comput.

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","978-1-4673-5524-7","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","1","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Relevance feature selection with data cleaning for intrusion detection system","Suthaharan, S.; Panchagnula, T.","Dept. of Comput.

In order to obtain good accuracy in the evaluation, very large datasets should be considered. Intrusion traffic and normal traffic are in general dependent on a large number of network characteristics called features. However not all of these features contribute to the traffic characteristics. Therefore, eliminating the non-contributing features from the datasets, to facilitate speed and accuracy to the evaluation of machine learning techniques, becomes an important requirement. In this paper we suggest an approach which analyzes the intrusion datasets, evaluates the features for its relevance to a specific attack, determines the level of contribution of feature, and eliminates it from the dataset automatically. We adopt the Rough Set Theory (RST) based approach and select relevance features using multidimensional scatter-plot automatically. A pair-wise feature selection process is adopted to simplify. In our previous research we used KDD'99 dataset and validated the RST based approach. There are lots of redundant data entries in KDD'99 and thus the machine learning techniques are biased towards most occurring events. This property leads the algorithms to ignore less frequent events which can be more harmful than most occurring events. False positives are another important drawback in KDD'99 dataset. In this paper, we adopt NSL-KDD dataset (an improved version of KDD'99 dataset) and validate the automated RST based approach. The approach presented in this paper leads to a selection of most relevance features and we expect that the intrusion detection research using KDD'99-based datasets will benefit from the good understanding of network features and their influences to attacks.","1091-0050","978-1-4673-1374-2","","10.1109/SECon.2012.6196965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196965","NSL-KDD dataset;Rough Set Theory;intrusion detection;labeled datasets;relevance feature selection","Approximation methods;Cleaning;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;security of data","KDD'99-based datasets;NSL-KDD dataset;automated RST based approach;data cleaning;intrusion detection system;intrusion traffic;machine learning technique;multidimensional scatter-plot;network characteristics;network features;noncontributing feature;pairwise feature selection process;redundant data entries;relevance feature selection;rough set theory","","1","","17","","","15-18 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security of these assets is a day-to-day job placing a tremendous cognitive load on information-technology (IT) professionals, which can make it almost impossible to manage the security aspects of KMS. Autonomic-computing systems are well suited to manage KMS, as they use high-level system objectives provided by administrators as the basis for managing the security of KMS. The authors model the self-protection and self-healing configuration attributes in autonomic systems through game-theoretic models. The proposed modeling approach progressively moves from a manual intervention-oriented security setup to an autonomic security setup. This allows the authors to compare and contrast the different approaches and provide insights on their applicability to different security environments. The authors find that moving to a partial autonomic system with self-healing mechanisms can provide a stable environment for securing enterprise knowledge assets and can reduce hacking. It is beneficial to implement an autonomic system when manual investigation costs are higher and/or when the volume of malicious traffic is very low. An autonomic approach is especially attractive when it is difficult to impose penalties on malicious users.

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","2","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The genuine user activity includes, casual browsing of IED data and downloading of IED data while a Ping flood Denial of Service (DoS) and password crack attack are performed for malicious attacks. Classification is done using possibilistic decision trees for the logarithmic histogram of the time difference between the arrival of two consecutive packets. The main contribution of this paper is the use of non-specificity for obtaining a continuous valued possibilistic decision tree and its cut points.

However, the absence of centralized control makes it vulnerable to various threats from insiders such as unauthorized attempt to access and/or manipulate information. An attacker has the ability to listen to all network traffic, and even make changes causing serious damages to confidentiality. In the context of ambient intelligent systems, detection of intrusion is even more important. There are numerous sensors, communicating among themselves in an unambiguous manner. Attacks such as sleep deprivation, eavesdropping, etc have become all the more dangerous for heavy dependence on ad-hoc wireless communications. The timeliness of data delivery is of utmost importance in systems like healthcare. Intrusion of any kind may lead to a chaotic condition. The focus of research is now on developing full-proof IDS for the AmI systems.

These digital documents are the most important asset of an organization and are hence the chief target of insider abuse. Security policies provide the first step to prevent abuse by defining proper and improper usage of resources. Coarse grained security policies that operate on the ""principle of least privilege"" [J. H. Saltzer et al., (1974)] alone are not enough to address the insider threat, since the typical insider possesses a wide range of privileges to start with. In this paper, we propose a security policy that is tailored to prevent insider abuse. We define the concept of subject, object, actions, rights, context and information flow as applicable to the document control domain. Access is allowed based on the principles of ""least privilege and minimum requirements"", subject to certain constraints. Unlike existing techniques, the proposed policy engine considers, among other factors, the context of a document request and the information flow between such requests to identify potential malicious insiders. Enforcing these fine-grained access control policies gives us a better platform to prevent the insider abuse. Finally, for demonstration purposes, we present a framework that can be used to specify and enforce these policies on Microsoft Word documents, one of the popular document formats.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377237","Access Control;Digital Documents;Information Flow;Insider Threat","Access control;Collaboration;Computer hacking;Computer security;Contracts;Cryptography;Humans;Information management;Protection;Research and development","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;document handling","Microsoft Word document;access control;digital document;document control domain;information flow;insider threat;least privilege minimum requirement;online technology;security policy","","11","1","22","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20090210","2008","","","117","122","This paper presents a method of integration and implementation of transmitting video and audio data from multiple Internet protocol (IP) surveillance cameras in a wireless sensor network to a centralized management unit (central node) using real time streaming protocol (RTSP). The wireless network is based on ldquostarrdquo topology by using the IEEE 802.11 series of standards in wireless local area networks (WLAN). Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2","978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Building an integrated security gateway: Mechanisms, performance evaluations, implementations, and research issues","Ying-Dar Lin; Huan-Yun Wei; Shao-Tang Yu","Nat. Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Communications Surveys & Tutorials, IEEE","20091201","2002","4","1","2","15","Network security has become a critical issue for enterprises. This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured. This study focuses on building a product-like security gateway and on evaluating its performance. The integrated system with a self-developed Web management console is publicly available for downloading.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2002.5341332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341332","","Filtering;Filters;Intrusion detection;Linux;Network address translation;Open source software;Packaging;Security;Virtual private networks;Wide area networks","Internet;computer network performance evaluation;security of data","FWTK;FreeS/WAN;Linux kernel;Snort;Squid;content filtering;data structures;firewall;integrated security gateway;interoperability;intrusion detection system;ipchains;linear matching algorithms;network address translation;network security;open-source packages;performance evaluations;self-developed Web management console;software component;source code;virtual private network","","6","","35","","","First Quarter 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

International Conference on","20050725","2005","","","118","127","An autonomic detection coordinator is developed in this paper, which constructs a multi-layered boundary to defend against host-based intrusive anomalies by correlating several observation-specific anomaly detectors. Two key observations facilitate the model formulation: first, different anomaly detectors have different detection coverage and blind spots; second, diverse operating environments provide different kinds of information to reveal anomalies. After formulating the cooperation between basic detectors as a partially observable Markov decision process, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to search in an optimal cooperation manner, with the objective to achieve broader detection coverage and fewer false alerts. Furthermore, the coordinator's behavior can be adjusted easily by setting a reward signal to meet the diverse demands of changing system situations. A preliminary experiment is implemented, together with some comparative studies, to demonstrate the coordinator's performance in terms of admitted criteria.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467786","","Concrete;Detectors;Information science;Intelligent networks;Learning;Scalability;Wireless sensor networks","Markov processes;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;security of data","Markov decision process;autonomic detection coordinator;blind spots;host-based intrusive anomalies;multiagent learning problem;multilayered boundary construction;observation-specific anomaly detector;policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm","","3","1","23","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is widely used in critical national infrastructure, such as electric power, petroleum and chemical industries. Once an attack against the CPS obtains success, the consequence will be unimaginable. A well-designed risk assessment of CPS will provide an overall view of CPS security status and support efficient allocations of safeguard resources. Though there is much relationship between CPS and IT system, they are still different in various aspects, especially the requirement for real-time. Therefore, traditional risk assessment method for IT system can't be directly applied in CPS. New ideas on CPS risk assessment are in urgent need and one idea about this is addressed in this paper. Firstly, it presents a depict description of a three-level CPS architecture and makes an analysis on the corresponding security features in each level. Secondly, it sums up traditional risk assessment methods analyzes the differences between cyber physical system security and traditional IT system security. Finally, the authors blaze a trail under the new perspective of CPS after breaking the restriction of traditional risk assessment methods and propose a risk assessment idea for CPS.","","","","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2013.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846672","CPS;attack tree;risk assessment;simulation","Computer crime;Data communication;Information security;Quantization (signal);Risk management;Software","critical infrastructures;risk management","CPS risk assessment;CPS security status;IT system security;chemical industry;critical national infrastructure;cyber physical system security;cyber systems;cyber-physical system risk assessment;electric power;petroleum industry;risk assessment idea;risk assessment method;safeguard resources;security features;well-designed risk assessment","","0","","13","","","16-18 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model can also satisfy three requirements of distributed, self-organizing and lightweight. The network intrusion detection experiments based on the novel model and algorithm are designed to compare with Kim's artificial immune model for network intrusion detection which is based on clonal selection algorithm (CSA) and NSA. Experimental results show that the novel model and its algorithm quickens the affinity maturation process of detector population and stably increases the detection rate along with increasing evolutionary generation; but in Kim's conceptual mode, the affinity maturation process of detector population takes more time, the detection rate falls into a little degradation and maintains invariant for a long time.","","978-1-4244-3893-8","978-1-4244-3894-5","10.1109/IWISA.2009.5073094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5073094","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Degradation;Detectors;Evolutionary computation;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Vaccines","artificial immune systems;evolutionary computation;security of data","affinity maturation process;artificial immune model;detector population;immune evolutionary algorithm;negative selection algorithm;network intrusion detection;vaccine operator","","0","","13","","","23-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We define a flexible scheme using security classes, where an IDS is able to operate in different modes at each security class. This scheme helps in minimizing false alarms and informing the prevention system accurately about the severity of an intrusion. Shapley value is used to formally express the cooperation among all the nodes. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any study for the case where the intrusions in MANETs are analyzed, in order to decrease false positives, using cooperative game theory. Our game theoretic model assists in analyzing the contribution of each mobile node on each security class in order to decrease false positives taking into consideration the reputation of nodes. Simulation results are given to validate the efficiency of our model in detecting intrusions and reducing false positives.","1545-0678","0-7695-2838-4","0-7695-2838-4","10.1109/ICDCSW.2007.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4279094","","Aggregates;Computer security;Game theory;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Lead;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;security of data","Shapley value;cooperative game theory;cooperative intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network","","11","","16","","","22-29 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rough set can reduce dimensions of attributes and filter some invasion behaviors which are esay to identify. Secondly, less attributes selected by RS are input FSVM to train and classify, this method can improve operational speed of FSVM. For this model, FSVM uses an effective Fuzzy Membership Function based on the affinity among sample points to select an appropriate fuzzy membership to reduce the effects of outliers. Finally, Experimental results will show that the RS-FSVM performs the best recognition ability, indicating that RS-FSVM can serve as a promising model for intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4244-9855-0","978-1-4244-9857-4","10.1109/ISA.2011.5873410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5873410","","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Training","fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;information filtering;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","FSVM preprocessor;fuzzy membership function;fuzzy support vector machine;information security;intrusion detection system;invasion behavior;rough set theory","","0","","12","","","28-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
