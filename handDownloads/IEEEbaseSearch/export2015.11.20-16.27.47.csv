However, a high percentage of alerts generated by such systems are liable to be false positives. False positives create considerable administrative overheads, since these alerts typically require manual intervention from a network administrator In order to reduce the number of false positives, we propose a novel infrastructure approach involving what we call network quarantine channels. The network quarantine channels and associated techniques are used to perform further interaction with hosts that have been identified as the source of suspicious traffic. The network quarantine channels are used to provide a more accurate assessment of the potential attacks sent by suspicious hosts, before sending the final status of the alerts to the IDS monitor for the network administrator's response.","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198826","","Data analysis;Frequency;Information security;Intrusion detection;Prototypes;Remote monitoring;Telecommunication traffic","","","","0","","36","","","Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually these attacks exploit security flaws in the implementation of the ARP protocol at hosts. Up to now, detecting such attacks required setting up a machine with special-purpose software for this task. As an additional problem, few intrusion detection systems (IDS) are able to prevent MitM attacks. In this work we present a low-cost embedded IDS which, when plugged into a switch or hub, is able to detect and/or prevent MitM attacks automatically and efficiently.

Since both protocols utilize 4-way handshaking, we propose a Merkle-tree based handshaking scheme, which is capable of improving the resiliency of the network in a situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack.

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3","978-1-4244-6939-0","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first leaky coaxial cable sensor, introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, used pulse radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. Since then, there have been numerous papers on CW leaky cable sensors that detect, but do not locate intruders. Like Southwest Microwave's MicroPoint, the acoustic cable sensor introduced at the 1994 Carnahan conference, MicroTrack offers several new features, including the ability to precisely locate intruders. These features greatly improve sensor performance. This paper describes the technology and its broad range of applications including buried, surface and barrier mounted. MicroTrack is an ultra wide band (UWB) HF terrain-following radar. FM CW radar techniques are well known and have been widely used in radio altimeters and police radar for many years. However, it is only with the advent of low cost direct digital synthesis (DDS) chips, high speed and high resolution analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital processing components that it is now practical to apply FM CW radar techniques to leaky cables. MicroTrack uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to translate the swept frequency response into precise target location. The frequency diversity associated with the ultra wide bandwidth assures uniform detection along the length of the sensor cable. MicroTrack complies with radio regulatory requirements for low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors in the HF band.","","0-7803-7436-3","","10.1109/CCST.2002.1049250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049250","","Acoustic pulses;Acoustic sensors;Acoustic signal detection;Coaxial cables;Hafnium;Leak detection;Microwave sensors;Radar detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Ultra wideband radar","CW radar;access control;coaxial cables;fast Fourier transforms;radar applications;radar signal processing;sensors","FM CW radar techniques;Intrepid MicroTrack leaky coaxial cable sensor;barrier mounted applications;buried applications;digital processing components;fast Fourier transform;high speed high resolution analog to digital converters;intruder detection;intruder location;low cost direct digital synthesis chips;low power swept frequency field disturbance sensors;precise target location;radio regulatory requirements;surface applications;swept frequency response translation;ultra wide band HF terrain following radar","","4","2","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional intrusion detection systems have been unable to meet new security requirements. This paper proposes a collaborative intrusion detection model based on multi-agents. In this model, four kinds of agents are defined, which are organized in a hierarchical structure. The basic agents in every host or at the entrances of subnets are responsible for performing the simple detection and response tasks. The complicated collaboration task is executed by some separate coordination agents, which are responsible for synthetically analyzing the suspicious behavior that the lower-level agents are unable to identify. Coordination agents are also able to assign the task to the lower-level associated agents. Based on the hierarchical structure, the formal description of the model is given. By adaptive policies and dynamic association among some elements, this model provides dynamic adaptability to the changing environment and attacks. In addition, this paper also proposes the concept of coordination domain which facilitates the management of collaborative detection. The model lays a theoretical foundation for constructing dynamically adaptive intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-0721-5","","10.1109/CSSS.2012.202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394440","collaborative detection;coordination domain;intrusion detection;multi-agent","Adaptation models;Barium;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Economic indicators;Intrusion detection","computer network security;multi-agent systems","collaboration task;collaborative detection;collaborative intrusion detection model;computer network;coordination agents;dynamically adaptive intrusion detection system;hierarchical structure;multiagents;security requirements","","2","","3","","","11-13 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper will concentrate on network packets behavior leading to network-based intrusion detection. It will employ anomaly detection as its analysis strategy. In the field of signal analysis, the methods of wavelet transform have gotten wide application because of its unique merit. That idea will be tapped in this paper. The self-similarity property of real network traffic will be used together with the signal detection abilities of wavelets in detecting attacks.

Scalability to network traffic and easy updating of new attack patterns are mandatory requirements needed to perform this comparison. The simplest way to implement such system is using the memory-based deterministic finite automata, but their storage requirement is growing exponentially with the number of patterns. Another issue is the computation time in order to detect the attack in real time.

The system is trained using a 66% of randomly selected connections in as a subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection data set. The training model is created by a trained classifier and then used to classify the remaining 34% subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset in order to report on the effectiveness of the model. The results show that based on a selected set of features extracted using subset evaluation algorithm for classifiers and a best-first search mechanism, that decision tree algorithm J48 based on C4.5 provides 99.95% of correctly classified instances and is better than the Naïve Bayes technique.

This paper propose a method of integrating network security with criterion based access control to handle network security and the fine-grained Web database access control simultaneously. To improve efficiency, the model adopts two step access controls.

This paper presents a method for automatically profiling and subsequently predicting the behavior of computer system users. The method is based on evolutionary profiling agents evolving in real time in order to dynamically provide a profile for each subject under analysis. The paper presents some experimental results from real data providing scheduled time and the real effective use of resources made by users of a high performance computing (HPC) center.

The result is that managers must now monitor security on a more widely dispersed level. These changes are continuing to accelerate, making the security manager's job increasingly difficult. In this paper a better solution for Information Security management has been proposed by designing PrISM (Preventive Information Security Management). PrISM aims to develop and deploy an indigenous Information Security Management System (ISMS) with intrusion prevention capabilities. The objective is to develop an ISMS with appropriate security assurance controls and risk handling processes. This will provide best protection of critical assets against information warfare attacks.

QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal. We carry out several experiments on KDD 1999 dataset and show the evaluation results.","","978-0-7695-3849-5","","10.1109/PRDC.2009.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368241","Feature Selection;Intrusion Detection System;Paramter Optimizations;Proximity Metrics;Random Forests","Aerospace engineering;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication computing;USA Councils","security of data;software metrics","KDD 1999 dataset;feature selection;inaccurate detection rates;intrusion detection system;proximity metrics;proximity metrics computation;quantitative intensity value;quantitative intrusion intensity assessment;random forest","","0","","20","","","16-18 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If such an attack can be found, it implies that the target detector is vulnerable against mimicry attacks. In this work, we emphasize that there are two components of a buffer overflow attack: the preamble and the exploit. Although the attacker can modify the exploit component easily, the attacker may not be able to prevent preamble from generating anomalous behavior since during preamble stage, the attacker does not have full control. Previous work on mimicry attacks considered an attack to completely evade detection, if the exploit raises no alarms. On the other hand, in this work, we investigate the source of anomalies in both the preamble and the exploit components against two anomaly detectors that monitor four vulnerable UNIX applications. Our experiment results show that preamble can be a source of anomalies, particularly if it is lengthy and anomalous.","","978-0-7695-3390-2","","10.1109/PST.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641288","Information hiding;anomaly detection;mimicry attacks;vulnerability testing","Assembly;Buffer overflow;Computer science;Databases;Detectors;Gain control;Information analysis;Monitoring;Privacy;System testing","object detection;security of data","UNIX applications;anomalous behavior;buffer overflow attack;mimicry attacks;target detector","","2","","18","","","1-3 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such rate limiting schemes drop all excess-traffic when the request arrival rate goes above a certain empirically calculated threshold. Flooding based DoS/DDoS attacks like TCP SYN Attack does not exhibit any special signature except that their arrival-rate is high enough to overwhelm the victim. Hence it is very difficult to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic as they share the same signature. As a result, rate limiting schemes cause heavy collateral damage by dropping out legitimate traffic [15]. In this paper we propose a novel packet marking mechanism which not only mitigates DoS/DDoS attacks by filtering but also reduces collateral damage significantly by selectively dropping attack packets based on its packet mark while allowing the legitimate traffic to be processed smoothly. Our packet mark contains fingerprint of the path in each single packet which allows us in identifying attack packets coming from various sources even in case of IP spoofing. Our scheme does not require any protocol specific knowledge and can generically filter out attack packets for all kinds of flooding attacks. We have extensively evaluated our packet marking scheme. Results show effectiveness of our scheme in filtering attack traffic. Our scheme inflicts extremely low collateral damage to legitimate traffic while quickly detecting and selectively filtering attack traffic.","","978-1-4673-3149-4","","10.1109/ICCCT.2012.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394683","Anomaly Detection;DDoS;TCP SYN Attack;collateral damage;packet marking;selective filtering","Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Limiting;Routing;Servers;Topology","IP networks;computer network security;protocols;telecommunication traffic","Eagle Eyes;IP spoofing;TCP SYN attack;attack packet filtering;attack traffic filtering;collateral damage reduction;distributed denial of service attacks;dropping attack packets;excess traffic dropping;flooding based DDoS Attacks;protocol independent packet marking scheme;rate limiting schemes","","0","","18","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization technology is another technology which goes along with the cloud environment which is used most widely to reduce the cost purchasing the hardware infrastructures in organizations. Henceforth, the Cloud Computing Systems can be easily intruded by various types of cyber attacks including Denial of Serv-ice (DoS) attack and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which utilize the entire resources like CPU, Memory, etc and makes the server to starve. This creates a major impact reducing the efficiency of the virtual machines. In the proposed method, attack can be overcome by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Mitigation Strategy which uses the SYN Cookie to prevent the attack in the cloud to prevent the attack in which the server ignores the connection packets when it does not receive the correct Acknowledgement (ACK) from the client which requested the connection. The server here has rules to be check whether it is a legitimate client or the spoofed one using the first layer of security for hop count filtering mechanism and second layer of security is encoding the sequence number of the SYN packet so that only a legitimate client can decode it. Additionally security is also provided for the data packets using the Message Authentication Code (MAC) and thus client is authenticated.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996163","DoS/DDoS;Hop-Count Filtering;Message Authentication Code;SYN Cookie;Sequence number;Virtualization","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Filtering;IP networks;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;message authentication;transport protocols","ACK;CPU resource;DDos attack;Internet connection;MAC;SYN cookie;SYN packet;TCP mitigation strategy;Transmission Control Protocol mitigation strategy;acknowledgement;authenticated client;cloud access;cloud computing systems;connection packets;cyber attacks;data packets;distributed denial-of-service attack prevention;hardware infrastructures;hop count filtering mechanism;intrusion detection system;legitimate client;memory resource;message authentication code;purchasing cost reduction;security layer;sequence number encoding;spoofed client;temporarily cached information storage;third-party cloud servers;virtual machines;virtualization technology","","0","","14","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It adds complementary results to previous works of the authors in order to better address dynamic policies. Previous works of the authors provide several advances for enforcing the security of MAC system.An administration language for formalizing a large set of security properties is available to system administrators. That language uses several flow operators and ease the formalization of the required security properties. A solution is also available for computing the possible violations of any security property that can be formalized using our language. That solution computes several flow graphs in order to find all the allowed activities that can violate the requested properties. That paper addresses remaining problems related to the enforcement of the same kind of properties but with dynamic MAC policies. Enforcement is more much complex if we consider dynamic policies since the states of those policies are theoretically infinite. A new approach is proposed for dynamic MAC policies. The major idea is to use a meta-policy language for controlling the allowed evolutions of those dynamic policies. According to those meta-policy constraints, the computation problem becomes easier. The proposed solution adds meta-nodes within the considered flow graphs. A general algorithm is given for computing the required meta-nodes and the associated arcs. The proposed meta-graphs provide an overestimation of the possible flows between the different meta-nodes. The computation of the possible violations within the allowed dynamic policies is thus allowed. Several concrete security properties are considered using regular expressions for identifying the requested meta-contexts. The resulting violations, within the allowed meta-graphs, are computed and real violations are presented.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211030","","Access control;Concrete;Flow graphs;Information security;Linux;Mechanical factors;Operating systems;Permission;Protection;Safety","authorisation;graph theory;telecommunication security","dynamic mandatory access control policies;flow graphs;meta-policy constraints;security properties fitting","","0","","16","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the particularity of network security, a tool DTAD (dynamic taint analysis detector) for information flow security detection is designed and implemented, aiming at the problem of data security in network access. This tool performs log recording and state controlling for malicious access and virus vulnerability using the state-control characteristic of virtual machines. Defense systems capture network data by executing applications to determine whether these accesses (i.e. target jumping, function address and instruction access) are legitimate or not. Once an attack is detected, the tool records states of the virtual machine at the process level as well as the kernel level. For attacks caused by malicious code, the tool injects its own diagnostic code into the process space of running programs to substitute the malicious code, as a result, related information for the attacked process is collected. The tool is able to generate precise signatures for network intrusion detection by associating and comparing network data recorded in log files with process information collected by the virtual machine, the whole process is finished automatically. The tool can also precisely identify attack types and provide effective protection measures through fast signature releasing. Experiments have validated the efficiency of the tool in attack recognition and information protection, and indicated that this detection and protection system is effective in recognizing, tracking and processing taint data.","","978-0-7695-3185-4","978-0-7695-3185-4","10.1109/WAIM.2008.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597071","","Costs;Data security;Detectors;Information analysis;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Virtual machining;Viruses (medical)","computer viruses;program diagnostics;virtual machines","attack recognition;computer systems;data security;defense systems;diagnostic code;dynamic taint analysis detector;information flow security detection;information infection;information leakage;information protection;information security;log recording;malicious access;network access;network intrusion detection;state control;virtual machines;virus vulnerability","","0","","28","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previously, many hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate regular expression matching using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) because FPGAs allow updating of new attack patterns. Because of the increasing number of attacks, we need to accommodate a large number of regular expressions on FPGAs. Although the minimization of logic equations has been studied intensively in the area of computer-aided design (CAD), the minimization of multiple regular expressions has been largely neglected. This paper presents a novel sharing architecture allowing our algorithm to extract and share common subregular expressions. Experimental results show that our sharing scheme significantly reduces the area of pattern matching circuits for regular expression.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2007.909801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378271","Finite automata;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);intrusion detection;pattern matching","Acceleration;Circuits;Design automation;Equations;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic design;Minimization;Pattern matching","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;minimisation;security of data","FPGA;attack patterns;computer-aided design;logic equations;minimization;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching circuits;regular expression matching;sharing architecture;subregular expressions","","22","14","19","","","Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
