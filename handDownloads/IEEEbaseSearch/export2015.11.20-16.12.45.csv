Prior work considered Stellar scenario formation; in this paper we explore the advantages provided by using scenario context to assess the risk of actions occurring on a network. We describe the design and an evaluation of Stellar and its Security Assessment Declarative Language (SADL), a fast, stateful, simple-to-use language for assessing the priority of scenarios, on a high traffic network under constant attack. The evaluation of the Stellar system deployed on a large, operational enterprise network demonstrated its ability to scale to high alert volumes while accurately forming and prioritizing scenarios. Stellar not only produced high priority scenarios matching all incidents reported by human analysts, but also discovered additional scenarios of concern that had initially gone unnoticed. Furthermore, by following the simple formalism embedded in example SADL rules, system administrators quickly develop a correct understanding of the network they are protecting.","","0-7695-2317-X","","10.1109/IWIA.2005.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410706","","Aggregates;Buildings;Data security;Engines;Information security;Information systems;Laboratories;Protection;Risk management;Space technology","computer networks;real-time systems;risk management;security of data;sensor fusion;specification languages;system monitoring","Stellar;alert aggregation;alert correlation;fusion system;heterogeneous network defense systems;high traffic network;network protection;network risk assessment;operational enterprise network;real-time system;scenario building;scenario construction;security assessment declarative language;security risk assessment;security risk estimation;system administration","","3","","23","","","23-24 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a large data and it also consists of normal and abnormal pattern behavior. The analysis and detection of the abnormal pattern behavior in the network traffic data must spend a long time and very hard to find the intrusion pattern. However, the data mining technology can be utilized to extract normal and abnormal pattern behavior. In addition, an association rules technique is one kind of the data mining technology and it be widely utilized to find a pattern. It can discover the events that frequently occur in these data. In order to find the intrusion pattern, the network traffic data must be converted to the special format for the data mining process. In this paper, we propose the network traffic data to ARFF convertor for the association rules technique of the data mining. We developed the software by using Java language and Weka library. In order to evaluate the performance, we utilized the data set of the MIT-DAPRA 1999 in both week 4<sup>th</sup> and week 5<sup>th</sup>. Firstly, we wrote the Snort-IDS rules to detect the data set then record the alert data to mysql database. Secondly, the attributes of the header protocol from snort database will be selected such as tcp, icmp and udp protocol, then save the selected data as .csv file format. Thirdly, the .csv file will be converted to .arff file format by utilizing the Weka library. Finally, we used an apriori algorithm of the association rules mining technique to discover relation of itemsets in the data set. As the experimental result, our application can match the pattern that able to discover the frequent itemsets from the data set then it can generate the association rules which are helpful for computer and network administrator to analyze user behavior. In addition, the attribute of our application can be assigned the number of the attribute in the rule.

A firewall running on a single machine is potential bottleneck and cannot scale over certain thresholds, even if it has particular hardware built-in. Hence, parallel system appears as an alternative approach under this circumstance. This paper describes a design and implementation of parallel firewall architecture that is able to handle packets for high-speed network. The implementation utilizes arrays of Linux-based firewall under data parallel scheme running incorporate with specific ASIC switch. The load balancing mechanism, using hashing of disjoint subset, distributes the traffic among a configurable number of parallel machines, providing high performance with reliability, flexibility, and scalability. Implementation and measurements in a real network show that the proposed system is scalable to handle a data rate of 10 gigabit per second.","","978-1-4244-1816-9","978-1-4244-1817-6","10.1109/CCST.2008.4751324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751324","10 Gbps;Firewalls;Gigabit Ethernet;Load Distributor;Parallel;Security","Application specific integrated circuits;Ethernet networks;Filters;Hardware;High-speed networks;Load management;Parallel machines;Spine;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","Linux;authorisation;local area networks;parallel architectures;parallel machines","ASIC switch;Linux-based firewall;data parallel scheme;parallel firewall architecture;parallel machines;parallel system;ten gigabit Ethernet backbone","","0","","7","","","13-16 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are Probe, DOS, R2L and U2R attacks. But in this approach, there is no mathematical method for calculating filter parameters for DOS, R2L, U2R attacks.

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores. We show the scalability of our monitoring system to network processors with large numbers of cores. We also present a multicore prototype implementation of the monitoring system on an FPGA platform.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682721","FPGA;data plane attack;hardware monitor;multicore processor;network infrastructure;network security","Hardware;Internet;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Program processors;Security","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;grid computing;multiprocessing systems;telecommunication network routing","FPGA platform;computer networks;data plane attacks;denial-of-service attack;field programmable gate array;hardware monitoring resource sharing;hardware monitoring systems;multicore prototype;network data plane;network processors defense mechanism;network processors protection;packet forwarding operations;router control interface;router hardware;scalable hardware monitoring grid;scalable hardware monitors;single malformed UDP packet;vulnerable packet processing software","","0","","21","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, centralized botnets detection helps greatly improve control of unwanted traffic. The main contribution of this study is the development of a common detection mechanism aiming at the centralized botnets. In this work we investigate the intrinsic characteristics based on the distributed yet bursting property of the centralized botnets. Our study shows that there exist great similarity and synchronization among the behaviors and the command and control (C&C) traffic of the bots, because the bots are controlled to operate according to the programmed schedule. Firstly we can determine if the groups of flows are suspectable by performing evaluation on the payload similarity and sequence correlation. Further, we will monitor and keep tracking with the collective and simultaneous behaviors of the suspicious groups of hosts. As is shown by conducting experiments, the proposed method can detect and hold back the centralized botnets effectively before they seriously influence the normal operation on the wide-scale network.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207950","Bot;Centralized Botnet;Command and Control(C&C);Similarity and Synchronization","Centralized control;Command and control systems;Communication system traffic control;Distributed processing;Internet;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Sun","computer networks;synchronisation;telecommunication control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","HTTP;botnet controllers;centralized Botnet detection;command-and-control traffic;customized protocols;payload similarity;real-time communication platform;sequence correlation;synchronization;traffic aggregation;unwanted traffic control","","7","","23","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues.

The first detection electronics and set-ups were designed for indoor use (jewellery shops, museums, etc..) but in 1964 the first capacitive detectors for outdoor use i.e. perimeter security systems appeared on the market with very poor performance results. During the 1970's and 80's and sometimes over very long periods, several world wide electronic companies tried to create good working solutions using simple and inexpensive hardware for outdoor use. Sometimes excellent ideas were integrated in the electronic design but generally any investment in a innovative hardware design such as (Insulators, wiring, etc...) were poorly supported. In 1982 Siemens AG was the first company in this market which analysed all outdoor influences and who recognised the essential problems which cause any classic capacitive or electrostatic detector suffering from high unwanted false alarm rates. This was even if the newest sophisticated digital electronics and algorithms were used. The result was that already in 1984 a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created and patented by Siemens AG which remains state of the art even now and which is making capacitive detectors work under most of all environmental conditions. Nevertheless even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects. These effects change the field, periodically generating very high false alarm rates which are extremely difficult to detect and to measure. The reason is that the false alarm rate is specific to a site and as such is difficult to identify. It is a fact that even well trained system engineers have difficulty in solving such problems. This paper describes a practical case experienced in 1999 where a coincidental combination of seaside conditions and a local desert wind strongly interfered in the physics of a capacitive i.e. electrostatic field detector and where trivial (but expensive) measures needed to be taken to finally solve the problem","","0-7803-5965-8","","10.1109/CCST.2000.891181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891181","","Capacitance measurement;Consumer electronics;Detectors;Electrostatics;Hardware;Insulation;Intrusion detection;Investments;Security;Wiring","electric fields;safety systems","electrostatic field detector;intrusion detection;local desert wind;perimeter security systems;seaside conditions","","1","","4","","","2000","23 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 μW output power to the IOT smart nodes.

We have combined classifiers based on packet header information with classifiers based on payload distribution to increase detection rates in non-flood attacks. We have divided packet processing into two parts as header information processing and payload processing. In header information processing we select features from packet header and create model for normal behavior with histograms, then find out the deviation from created models and classify the network traffic. In payload processing we create models of normal payload by generating histograms of payload ASCII distribution and find deviation from created models and classify traffic. Our work differs from previous anomaly based detection techniques by creating histograms for both network header features and for payload of packet, so that our detection system identifies both flooding attacks and non flooding attacks efficiently.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972283","Anomaly Detection System;Attacks;histograms","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Histograms;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;anomaly detection system;computer networks;detection rates;flooding attacks;header information processing;nIDS;network attacks;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;nonflood attacks;packet header analysis;payload ASCII distribution;payload histograms;security package","","1","","12","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the immense increase of the number of users of Facebook made it rise to become the largest existing social network with more than 1.2 billion active users. However, these numbers also rose the attention of hackers and attackers who aim at propagating malware and viruses for obtaining confidential information regarding social network users. In this manner, it is crucial that each Facebook user is able to easily access, control and analyse the information shared on the corresponding profile so that profile usage deviations can be more efficiently detected. However, despite the fact that Facebook allows an analysis of all user actions through the Timeline Review, this information is not comprehensively organized and there is no statistical analysis of the user generated data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework comprising a Facebook event collector, which by being provided with an authentication token for a user profile obtained through a Facebook application developed for this purpose, collects all the corresponding posted information and stores it in a relational database for a posteriori analysis. Through the graphical interface of the developed application, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user's behaviour. By storing each event with the corresponding timestamp, we are able to perform an efficient and comprehensive analysis of all posted contents and compute statistical models over the obtained data. In this manner, we can create a notion of normal usage profile and detect possible deviations which may be indicative of a compromised user account.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912474","Monitoring Framework;Profile Hijack;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Analytical models;Authentication;Computational modeling;Databases;Facebook;Monitoring","computer viruses;graphical user interfaces;information dissemination;relational databases;social networking (online);statistical analysis","Facebook event collector framework;Timeline Review;authentication token;content dissemination;graphical interface;information dissemination;malware;normal usage profile;posted content analysis;profile monitoring purposes;profile usage deviations;relational database;social networks;statistical models;viruses","","0","","15","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population.

However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although Ethernet's flat addressing and transparent bridging allow each subnet to run with minimal configuration, interconnecting subnets at the IP level introduces significant management overhead that increases with the size of the network. As an alternative, we propose a scalable and efficient zero-configuration enterprise (SEIZE) networking architecture. SEIZE provides plug-and-play capability via globally unique flat addressing, while ensuring scalability and efficiency through shortest-path routing and hash-based location resolution. Switches perform location resolution on demand and can cache the results to optimize routing paths and to reduce the number of location-resolution requests.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493","Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation","","digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures","NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering","","7","","36","","2010-06-17","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our dynamic multisource multipath routing algorithm design integrates with a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm to remove malicious nodes from the sensor network. By controlling the redundancy level for multisource multipath and intrusion detection settings dynamically with energy considerations as prescribed by our algorithm, we demonstrate that the lifetime of a query-based autonomous WSN is maximized in response to changing environment conditions including node density, radio range, and node capture rate.","","978-1-4673-5069-3","","10.1109/ISADS.2013.6513409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513409","Wireless sensor networks;intrusion detection;multisource multipath routing;reliability;security;timeliness","Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Redundancy;Routing;Sensors;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","23","","","6-8 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

None of the existing wireless security protocols considers protection against them. We propose a novel scheme that detects and reduce DoS attacks in the WLANs. The scheme is based on random number rate control mechanism. It utilizes delegation concept for authentication at the Access Point (AP). Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one. The scheme protects AS from DoS as hash calculations for detection of DoS are done once only. Scheme also prevents against legacy authentication/association and deauthentication/disassociation flooding DoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-0127-5","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141379","802.11i;Denial of Service;WLAN Security;authentication","Authentication;Computer crime;Floods;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Microwave integrated circuits;Public key","access protocols;authorisation;client-server systems;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;message passing;wireless LAN","DoS attack detection;DoS attack reduction;WLAN;access point;authentication server;client authentication requests;deauthentication;denial of service attacks;hash calculations;legacy association;legacy authentication;message forwarding;random number rate control mechanism;wireless LAN;wireless security protocols","","0","","29","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the ability to traverse network address translation (NAT) and bypass firewalls, as well as the induced bandwidth burden due to the super node (SN) mechanism, make Skype considerably a threat to enterprise networks security and availability. Because Skype uses both encryption and overlays, detection and blocking of Skype is non- trivial. Motivated by the work ofBiondi and Desclaux [3], we adopt the view of Skype as a backdoor and we take a forensic approach to analyze it. We share our experience in this paper. With the forensic evidence, we identify a transport layer communication framework for Skype. We further formulate a set of socket-based detection and control policies for Skype traffics.

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the recent push for a “Smart Grid” has shown promise for increased efficiency, security has often been an after-thought, leaving this critical infrastructure vulnerable to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, devices crucial to the safe operation of the power grid are left in remote substations with their configuration interfaces completely open, providing a vector for outsiders as well as insiders to launch an attack. This paper develops the framework for an overlay network of gateway devices that provide authenticated access control and security monitoring for these vulnerable interfaces. We develop a working prototype of such a device and simulate the performance of deployment throughout a substation. Our results suggest that such a system can be deployed with negligible impact on normal operations, while providing important security mechanisms. By doing so, we demonstrate that our proposal is a practical and efficient solution for retro-fitting security onto crucial power system devices.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007774","","Maintenance engineering;Performance evaluation;Security;Smart grids;Substations;Universal Serial Bus","authorisation;message authentication;overlay networks;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;smart power grids;substations","authenticated access control;configuration interfaces;cyber attacks;gateway devices;insider threat mitigation;overlay network;physical overlay framework;power grid;power system devices;remote substations;retro-fitting security;security mechanisms;security monitoring;smart grid","","0","","22","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They perform a wide range of important network functions, including WAN optimizations, intrusion detection systems, network and application level firewalls, etc. Depending on the processing requirement of traffic, packet processing for different traffic flows may consume vastly different amounts of hardware resources (e.g., CPU and link bandwidth). Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1) work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice. We show, both analytically and experimentally, that our queueing scheme achieves nearly perfect Dominant Resource Fairness.","","","","10.1109/ICNP.2013.6733610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6733610","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Middleboxes;Radiation detectors;Round robin;Schedules;Time complexity","computational complexity;queueing theory;scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks","WAN optimization;application level firewall;dominant resource fairness;elastic round robin;intrusion detection system;low complexity packet scheduler;multiple middlebox resources;multiresource fair queueing scheme;multiresource round robin;packet processing;time complexity;traffic flow","","2","","23","","","7-10 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, one of the most significant objectives in wireless communication networks is to improve the autonomy of the terminal devices. In this paper, we focus on the communication energy consumption, particularly on the data transmission part, which is one of the most energy-demanding operations of a wireless device. To satisfy a specified power level at the receiver, the transmission power consumption varies, strongly depending on the channel state of the wireless link. Considering that the communication is much more energy efficient when the channel conditions are good, we design and propose a novel distributed scheduler that opportunistically schedules data transmissions, with a view of minimizing the energy consumption of a wireless device and prolonging its battery lifetime. In fact, by exploiting the stochastic characteristics of the wireless channel, we postpone the communication up to an acceptable time deadline until we find the best expected channel conditions. The proposed time scheduling strategies are based on the optimal stopping theory, considering two minimization approaches for the consumption of transmission energy. Simulation results manifest that the proposed schemes offer significant energy efficiency and highlight their flexibility.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2012.2217387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296725","Channel awareness;energy efficiency;opportunistic transmission scheduling;optimal stopping","Data communication;Energy consumption;Minimization;Quality of service;Receivers;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","computer power supplies;energy consumption;minimisation;stochastic processes;wireless channels","battery lifetime;channel-aware opportunistic transmission scheduling;communication energy consumption;data transmission;distributed scheduler;energy efficiency;energy-efficient wireless link;minimization approach;optimal stopping theory;power level;stochastic characteristic;terminal device;time scheduling strategy;transmission energy consumption;transmission power consumption;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless device","","8","","32","","2012-09-06","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a hybrid IDS, which combines network and host IDS, with anomaly and misuse detection mode, utilizes auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and applies data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities.","","978-1-4244-6388-6","978-1-4244-6389-3","10.1109/ETCS.2010.478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459845","analysis engine;apriori algorithm;data mining;hybrid ids;intrusion detection","Computer hacking;Computer science;Content addressable storage;Data mining;Data security;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Engines;Intrusion detection;System testing","data mining;feature extraction;security of data;uncertainty handling","auditing programs;data mining;feature extract;host IDS;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;misuse detection mode;network connection;network-based intrusion detection techniques;security infrastructures;uncertainty characteristic","","4","","5","","","6-7 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, little work is done to analyze the robustness and reliability of SIP severs under DoS attacks. In this paper, we show that the robustness and reliability of generic SIP servers is inadequate than commonly perceived. We have done our study using a customized analysis tool that has the ability to synthesize and launch different types of attacks. We have integrated the tool in a real SIP test bed environment to measure the performance of SIP servers. Our measurements show that a standard SIP server can be easily overloaded by sending simple call requests. We define the performance metrics to measure the effects of flooding attacks on real time services - VoIP in SIP environment - and show the results on different SIP server implementations. Our results also provide insight into resources' usage by SIP servers under flooding attacks.

These proposed machine learning based IDSs come in addition to the already deployed signatures which are already in use in conventional intrusion detection systems like Snort-Wireless and Kismet. In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too. On the other hand, even though Snort-Wireless is an infrastructure independent detector, it cannot adapt to unknown attacks even if they are similar to others for which it has signatures on.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529352","Denial of Service;Genetic Programming;Intrusion Detection System;Wireless Networks","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;Detectors;Floods;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;wireless LAN","GP based IDS;Kismet;Snort-Wireless;WiFi networks;data link layer;genetic programming;intrusion detection system;machine learning;wireless networks","","0","","17","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the presented parallel learning framework the global population is divided into some subpopulations, each assigned to a distinct processor. Each subpopulation consists of the same class fuzzy rules. These rules evolve independently in the proposed parallel manner. Second we validated the approach through the development and evaluation of a prototype, the Communication-Garden architecture and technology to fulfill the archive users', we propose three-tier architecture. It includes information representation, categorization, and visualization. The representation level applies automatic indexing techniques to extract semantics to represent message content, while the categorization level employs different analysis technologies to extract patterns and salient structures from the archived information.","","978-1-4244-8664-9","","10.1109/ICSEM.2010.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640161","Computer-mediated communication;analysis;categorization;visualization","Classification algorithms;Communities;Computers;Data mining;Genetics;Intrusion detection;Message systems","computer aided instruction;computer mediated communication;computer networks;data visualisation;fuzzy systems;indexing","automatic indexing techniques;communication-garden architecture;computer communication;computer networks;computer-mediated communication;education;fuzzy rules;information categorization;information representation;information visualization;parallel learning framework","","0","","17","","","12-14 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents various host based anomaly detection techniques. One technique uses clustering with markov network (CMN). In CMN we first cluster the benign training data and then from each cluster we build a separate markov network to model the benign behavior. During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data. We experimentally show that CMN approach outperforms several other approaches and performs similar to CMN-OS and we show that it is less sensitive to noise as compared to other approaches.","","978-1-4799-3143-9","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754055","Computer security;Markov random fields;host-based Anomaly Detection","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Manganese;Markov random fields;Testing;Training;Training data","Markov processes;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;probability;security of data","CLP;CMN;CMN-OS;benign training clustering;clustered label propagation;clustering-with-Markov network;computer-security;host-based anomaly detection techniques;learning techniques;malicious training clustering;outlying subspace;probability calculation","","0","","20","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
