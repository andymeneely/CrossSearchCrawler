Nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume cooperative and friendly network context, and do not address security issues. Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods. The obtained results show that the new AACK scheme outperforms both of the TWOACK and Watchdog methods in terms of network packet delivery ratio and routing overhead.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-6695-5","","10.1109/AINA.2010.136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474764","AACK;DSR;IDS;MANET;Misbehaving;TWOACK;Watchdog;packet dropping","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Power system protection;Protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing","MANET;adaptive acknowledgment intrusion detection;authentication solutions;encryption;forward packets;mobile ad-hoc network;network packet delivery ratio;node detection enhancement;routing overhead;wireless links","","4","","20","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the application of source code mutation has not been applied for testing FSB. In this work, we apply the idea of mutation-based testing technique to generate an adequate test data set for testing FSBs. Our work addresses FSBs related to ANSI C libraries. We propose eight mutation operators to force the generation of adequate test dataset.

Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by conventional intrusion detection methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","1536-1284","","","10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599218","","Communication system traffic control;Engines;Feedback control;Hidden Markov models;Hysteresis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Traffic control;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;three-term control","cooperative ad hoc wireless network;distributed hidden Markov model;feedback control engine;intrusion detection","","6","","17","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6","978-1-4244-6024-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.","","","","10.1109/ICCAC.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312172","Anomaly detection;DNS;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Machine learning;Supervised training","Cloud computing","","","","","","","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Magnitude and complexity of attacks is continuously growing with every minute development in World Wide Web. There are plenty of web attack detection techniques but they cannot fully comprehend the required degree of security for complex web applications. The reasons include static nature of attack detection mechanism, lack of expressiveness in attack detection rules, and absence of reasoning capability to detect unanticipated ways an attack can be launched. To cater these issues, a formal approach is required that has more expressiveness and equipped with reasoning. These traits are fully adhered to by the Semantic techniques. This paper introduces an approach for utilizing Semantic techniques in web application security. This has never been introduced previously to the best of our knowledge. Here the HTTP Protocol ontology is presented to mitigate the communication protocol attacks. In this paper we are focusing on communication protocol attacks including abnormal HTTP messages, HTTP request smuggling and HTTP response splitting.

While middleboxes are crucial to the cloud, concerns have been raised regarding their costs, manageability, and performance overhead. To tackle these problems, researchers have proposed an alternative to hardware middleboxes: network function virtualization. Software applications are deployed in place of hardware middleboxes, offering equivalent functionalities while greatly improving flexibility, manageability, and cost-efficiency.

Madras, Chennai, India","Local Computer Networks (LCN), 2012 IEEE 37th Conference on","20130131","2012","","","76","84","Network traffic characterisation and modeling using time series models is an area which has been extensively studied in the past. Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","0742-1303","978-1-4673-1565-4","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689","Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols","DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks","","0","","47","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So it is very necessary to develop faster and more efficient string matching algorithms in order to overcome the troubles on performance. On a basis of Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm, a new string matching algorithm is presented in this paper. The algorithm is described in detail. The new algorithm has been greatly improved. The algorithm is one simplification of Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm. Array NEXT in Preprocessing stage is redesigned. A novel generated rules are presented. Using these rules, a simple NEXT is generated. And based on the concept of reference point, all make the algorithm to have better performance and more efficient. These characteristics will be useful in all these applications. Main features of the algorithm are presented, then explained its work processes. The algorithm also passed test and is validated.

Early yet accurate warning of these attacks is critical for both operators and end users. However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks. Our classifier detects those five attacks with high accuracy and does so in a timely manner.","0890-8044","","","10.1109/MNET.2009.5274916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5274916","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Protection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","discovery of attacks;intrusion detection system;network security;network-based attacks;packet dynamics","","1","","20","","","September 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite the burgeoning literature, accurate detection of malware remains an elusive and challenging endeavor due to the increasing usage of payload encryption and sophisticated obfuscation methods. Also, the large variety of malware classes coupled with their rapid proliferation and polymorphic capabilities and imperfections of real-world data (noise, missing values, etc) continue to hinder the use of more sophisticated detection algorithms. This paper presents a novel machine learning based framework to detect known and newly emerging malware at a high precision using layer 3 and layer 4 network traffic features. The framework leverages the accuracy of supervised classification in detecting known classes with the adaptability of unsupervised learning in detecting new classes. It also introduces a tree-based feature transformation to overcome issues due to imperfections of the data and to construct more informative features for the malware detection task.

The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of TCAM lookups per payload by m times with the marginally enlarged TCAM size which can be implemented by cascading multiple TCAMs. Due to the reduced number of TCAM lookups, we can easily achieve a multi-gigabit rate for scanning the packet payload. Furthermore, multi-packet inspection is achieved easily by the extended state transition diagram with the shifting distance.

WLANs have gone through rapid changes with respect to their security standards in near time. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack is one of the most catastrophic attacks in WLAN. Stealth MITM (SMITM) attack is a new way of doing MITM based on Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning. In this attack, ARP poisoning is done directly to the victim by forging the frame ARP response protocol structure and exploiting WPA2 key management. In this paper we propose a Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) for SMITM attack. The proposed WIDS successfully detects the SMITM attack and other similar attacks like MITM (using ARP poisoning) and IP Spoofing. The proposed WIDS system is simulated in NS-3 network simulator and the scheme is found to work correctly when the attacker is static and is under the coverage of a single sensor during the complete period of attack.","","978-1-4673-2922-4","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449834","","Local area networks;Logic gates;Probes;Programmable logic arrays;Quality of service;Transmitters;Uplink","computer network security;protocols;wireless LAN","ARP;IP spoofing;NS-3 network simulator;SMITM;WIDS;address resolution protocol;man-in-the-middle attack;security standards;stealth MITM;stealth detection;wireless LAN;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area networks","","3","","9","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads. We find (1) the load/store units can be the bottleneck of protocol processing; and (2) in connection establishing phase of TCP processing, cache contention between threads is more aggressive than any other phase.

To answer this question, we conduct a study from three recent data sources. Specifically, we focus on the following broad questions: (a) how are email addresses harvested, (b) where is spam coming from, and (c) how does spam evolve over time. First, we discuss whether spammers still use email harvesting: 34% of the honeypot accounts we publicised received spam after 72 days on average. Interestingly, we find that simple email address obfuscation is quite effective against harvesting. Second, we identify significant skew in the spatial distribution of the origin of spam in both the IP-level and AS-level of granularity. We find that 20% of the active IPs are responsible for 80% of the total volume of spam and that 10% of the spamming ASes are responsible for the 90% of the volume. Finally, we study the temporal characteristics of the spamming IPs and find that spam activity has spread to new /8 subnetworks since 2006. Considering these spatio-temporal trends, the future of anti-spam is mixed: the current skewed spatial distribution of spam sources could be helpful in filtering spam, but the fact that spam sources are spreading in the IP space is a worrisome sign.","","978-1-4577-1392-7","","10.1109/ICNP.2011.6089060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6089060","","Distribution functions;Educational institutions;HTML;IP networks;Servers;Unsolicited electronic mail","IP networks;Internet;information filtering;security of data;unsolicited e-mail","AS-level;IP-level;anti-spam;email address;email harvesting;honeypot account;network-level characteristics;spam activity;spam filtering;spam source;spamming IP","","1","","29","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks.

A novel approach to automatically synthesize a decentralized Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as well as an efficient implementation of local monitors are presented. In our scenario, agents perform possibly different independent tasks, but cooperate to guarantee the entire system's safety. Indeed, agents plan their next actions by following a set of logic rules which is shared among them. Such rules are decentralized, i.e. they depend only on configurations of neighboring agents. However, some agents may not be acting according to this cooperation protocol, due to spontaneous failure or tampering. To detect such misbehaviors, we propose a solution where each agent runs a local monitor that uses only locally available information. In this paper, we present an implementation of such monitors by which events occurred to a target-agent can be estimated for any combination of neighborhood and observable space. Validity of the proposed implementation is shown through simulation.","","978-1-4244-1154-2","978-1-4244-1154-2","10.1109/COASE.2007.4341717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341717","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Fault detection;Intrusion detection;Logic;Mobile robots;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Remotely operated vehicles;Vehicle safety","mobile robots;multi-agent systems;multivariable systems;security of data","IDS;decentralized intrusion detection system;local monitor implementation;mobile robots;secure multiagent system;target-agent","","4","","13","","","22-25 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 15th International Conference on","20020807","2001","","","253","258","As coordinated attacks on networks become more frequent, the study of systems that can identify unlawful attempts to penetrate a network, or so called intrusion detection systems (IDS), has become increasingly popular. IDS traditionally suffer from an inability to detect an attack that is built from a sequence of valid network activity. For this reason it is important to develop a system capable of analyzing the global nature of the network activity. One such system is GrIDS-a graph based intrusion detection system for large networks, being developed at the University of California, Davis, California. This system constructs graphs based on the network activity and then detects attacks based on an analysis of the characteristics of these graphs. One of the bottlenecks in this process is the inability to efficiently compare characteristics of very large networks. This often becomes necessary because the increasing complex nature of network traffic generates graphs with multiple nodes and edges. We propose using a new result on subgraph isomorphism due to Eppstein (see Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, vol.3, no.3, p.1-27, 1999) to maximize the efficiency of this analysis. This provides the IDS with the ability to analyze traffic on a broader level and thus increases the overall performance of the system","","0-7695-0951-7","","10.1109/ICOIN.2001.905436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905436","","Authorization;Computer industry;Computer network reliability;Explosives;Information security;Intelligent networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;graph theory;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","GrIDS;Internet security;University of California;coordinated network attacks;graph based intrusion detection system;graphical techniques;large networks;network characteristics;network traffic analysis;subgraph isomorphism;system performance;valid network activity","","0","3","6","","","2001","31 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a passive testing approach that permits to check whether a system respects its security policy. To reach this goal, we specify this policy using 'Nomad' formal language which is based on deontic and temporal logics.

Currently, in most practical CBR systems, the feature weights are given by domain experts subjectively. In this paper, we propose a PID operator-based feature weight learning method based on the fundamental theory of the control system. PID-based feature weighting method is a self-adaptive method, which utilizing the similar neural network architecture to construct the case base. Through designing 3 kinds of adjusting operators: Proportional, integral and derivative operator (PID), and each operator with different properties: reactive, prudent and sensitive, we can adjust the feature weight from different point of views, such as the current adjust results, the history results or the last two results. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the method, the experiment of network anomaly detection is conducted and the experimental results show that all 3 operators are effective which can converge the intrusion detection system into a stable state in relative small iterations.","","978-0-7695-3507-4","","10.1109/CSIE.2009.355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170599","Feature Weight Learning;Intrusion Detection;PID operators","Application software;Computer science;Control systems;Costs;History;Indexing;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Neural networks;Three-term control","adaptive control;case-based reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neurocontrollers;security of data;self-adjusting systems;stability;three-term control","CBR system;PID-based feature weight learning method;adaptively learning weight;case-based reasoning;domain expert;intrusion detection system;network anomaly detection;neural network architecture;proportional-integral-and-derivative operator;self-adaptive method;stable state","","0","","16","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sixth IEEE International Symposium on a","20050627","2005","","","374","380","A mobile ad hoc network is a collection of nodes that are connected through a wireless medium and form rapidly changing topologies. The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead. We have developed a prototype that was evaluated in AODV-enabled networks using the ns-2 network simulator.","","0-7695-2342-0","","10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443525","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Data security;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;knowledge based systems;minimisation;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","knowledge-based techniques;minimisation;mobile ad hoc networks;network topologies;real-time intrusion detection;secure routing protocol","","12","","14","","","13-16 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our proposed scheme, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level intrusion detection is presented to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques. The network is divided to zones with one zone manager which is monitoring on cluster heads in its zone, but the most important problem is how can recognize the trustworthiness of zone manager which is done by “honest neighbors” of zone manager.

In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, and exploit this questionable assumption to subvert VM introspection. In particular, we present an attack called DKSM (Direct Kernel Structure Manipulation), and show that it can effectively foil existing VM introspection solutions into providing false information.

Comparing these approaches and developing novel run-time support algorithms is difficult due to the multicore system-on-a-chip nature of network processors. In this paper, we present a model for network processors that can aid in evaluating different run-time support systems. The model considers workload characteristics of applications and network traffic. We use a queuing network abstraction to model different runtime systems.

This last characteristic presents expressive advantages comparing to intrusion detection systems purely based on rules, because it dismisses the use of an extensive knowledge base and solves the false negative and false positive problems, through the fine adjustment of weights, given by the variation of the acceptation rate in the network output, when the network is trained.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-2065-0","978-1-4244-2066-7","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575234","","Artificial neural networks;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Packaging;Protection;Prototypes","computer networks;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;telecommunication security","IDS Snort;adaptive process;artificial neural network;intrusion detection;knowledge base;learning phase;network training","","0","","15","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a dataset containing hundreds of variants for several major malware families, our method achieves 98.6% classification accuracy using the signatures generated by the DBN. The presented method is completely agnostic to the type of malware behavior that is logged (e.g., API calls and their parameters, registry entries, websites and ports accessed, etc.), and can use any raw input from a sandbox to successfully train the deep neural network which is used to generate malware signatures.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280815","Autoencoders;Automatic Signature Generation;Deep Belief Network;Deep Learning;Malware","Malware;Training","belief networks;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","DBN;DeepSign;automatic malware signature classification;automatic malware signature generation;deep belief network;deep learning;deep neural network;deep stack denoising autoencoders;deep unsupervised neural network;malware behavior invariant compact representation;malware families","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a contribution, we show how a grid-based collaborative environment can be employed in the production, delivery, and use of knowledge and mechanisms for intrusion detection and containment. Such environment provides a laboratory for the development of security resources (signatures, software patches, informative texts, logs, and others), augmented by a digital library capable of supporting the efficient storage, manipulation, and deployment of such resources.

It's difficult to detect out by conventional techniques as firewall or misuse-based intrusion detection. Anomaly detection has been considered as a promising approach for masquerade detection, which is based on the idea that significant departures from normal behavior could be considered due to a masquerade. However, for low detection accuracy and high false alarm rate, it is still in research stage. Till now, many methods have been proposed from different viewpoints, such as Hidden Markov Model, Naive Bayes, SVM, and so on. Compared with other methods that with well theoretical backgrounds, two intuitive determined statistical methods: the Customized Grammars method and the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness, reported the much better detection efficiency. Especially, both methods based on the intuitive notion that the more frequently a usage pattern was employed by current user previously, the more indicative of normal. In other hand, the statistics of usage pattern in the Customized Grammars method was based on sequential grammars, and that of the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness was on commands and 2-grams. In this paper, these two methods are compared and evaluated on two benchmark data sets of Unix command sequence: the Schonlau data and the Greenberg data. As a result, contributions of command frequency and command sequence grammar in IDS were analyzed and clarified.","","978-1-4244-3782-5","978-4-9904-2590-6","10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045945","Command sequence;Customized grammar;Intrusion detection system (IDS);Masquerade detection;N-gram;Self signature;Uniqueness;Unix","Application software;Computer applications;Computer industry;Data security;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Statistical analysis;Statistics;Support vector machines","Unix;authorisation;grammars;statistical analysis","Greenberg data;IDS;Schonlau data;Unix command sequence;anomaly detection;command frequency;command sequence grammar;customized grammars;firewall;masquerade detection;misuse-based intrusion detection;self signature approach;statistical methods","","1","","18","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, Tor is not only used for good; a great deal of the traffic in the Tor networks is in fact port scans, hacking attempts, exfiltration of stolen data and other forms of online criminality. The anonymity network Tor is often misused by hackers and criminals in order to remotely control hacked computers. In this paper we present our methodology for detecting any connection to or from Tor network. Our detection method is based on a list of Tor servers. We process the network traffic and match the source and destination IP addresses for each connection with Tor servers list. The list of Tor servers is automatically updated each day and the detection is in the real time. We applied our methodology on campus live traffic and showed that it can automatically detect Tor connections in the real time. We also applied our methodology on packet capture (pcap) files which contain real and long-lived malware traffic and we proved that our methodology can successfully detect Tor connections.","","978-1-78561-072-1","","10.1049/cp.2014.1411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7141237","Cyber attacks;Tor network;bonet;intrusion detection system;malware","","invasive software","IP addresses;Tor connection detection;Tor-based malware;anonymous communication networks;malware traffic","","0","","","","","3-5 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In this paper, perform a comparative analysis between various tools available that can handle this historical data & hence facilitate in the Data Mining. For comparing the tools for data retrieval, we cover inclemently, from using traditional DBMS to the more sophisticated tools that utilize Bit-Map indexing or Hoeffding Algorithm.

These requirements are becoming more fine-grained, where access control depends on heterogeneous isolation patterns like access deny, trusted communication, and payload inspection. However, organizations are looking to design usable and optimal security configurations that can harden the network security within enterprise budget constraints. This requires analyzing various alternative security architectures in order to find a security design that satisfies the organizational security requirements as well as the business constraints. In this paper, we present ConfigSynth, an automated framework for synthesizing network security configurations by exploring various security design alternatives to provide an optimal solution. The main design alternatives include different kinds of isolation patterns for traffic flows in different segments of the network. ConfigSynth takes security requirements and business constraints along with the network topology as inputs. Then it synthesizes optimal and cost-effective security configurations satisfying the constraints. ConfigSynth also provides optimal placements of different security devices in the network according to the given network topology. ConfigSynth uses Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) for modeling this synthesis problem. We demonstrate the scalability of the tool using simulated experiments.","1063-6927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2013.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681625","automatic synthesis;constraints;formal logic;security configuration","Business;Equations;Mathematical model;Network topology;Payloads;Security;Usability","Internet;authorisation;business data processing;computability;computer network security;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","ConfigSynth;Internet services;SMT;access deny;alternative security architectures;business constraints;enterprise budget constraints;enterprise networks;formal framework;heterogeneous isolation patterns;network security configuration synthesis;network security design synthesis;network topology;optimal security configurations;organizational security requirements;payload inspection;resource access control;satisfiability modulo theories;security threats;synthesis problem modeling;traffic flows;trusted communication","","0","","15","","","8-11 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
