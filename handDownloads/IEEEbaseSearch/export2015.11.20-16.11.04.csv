Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells in innate immunity that perform the central role of sensing infection situation and coordinating T cells behavior. DCs play an integral part in incorporation of DT into responsive IDSs. To illustrate how the functionality and control mechanism of DCs can be harnessed to solve real network traffic problems, the DCs inspired model (DCML) for intrusion detection is presented. Introducing interaction between DCs and memory T cells to sense danger is a highlight notion in DCML. Additionally, using multiplicity of signals for input into the final decision increases robustness and effectiveness of IDS.","","978-1-4244-1685-1","978-1-4244-1686-8","10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4525387","","Biological system modeling;Computer security;Distributed control;Event detection;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Pathogens;Protection;Robustness","security of data","antigen presenting cells;danger theory;dendritic cells inspired model;intrusion detection system;negative selection algorithm;sensing infection situation","","0","","17","","","6-8 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detecting such attacks is especially challenging because most system owners and system administrators use networks to remotely manage the systems they are responsible for. In previous work, we introduced the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) that has a scalable architecture to deal with such threats. This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic. The paper discusses how various high level rules (HLR) can detect new unwanted behaviors without any user intervention. Experiments conducted on three types of applications -- FTP, database, and Web -- show that the enhanced AVPS can detect known and unknown insider attacks through high level rules and process automation.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","","10.1109/SERE.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258317","Insider threat;autonomic computing;network security;privileged user;self-protection","Automation;Databases;Humans;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers","","","","0","","43","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed SSF algorithm uses a tiny data structure, and is light-computational and cache- resident. It can be implemented efficiently in a software-based platform. Experimental results show that with Snort's patterns, the computation time of the SSF with the AC algorithm to process the Defcon9 trace is only one-third to half of that of a pure AC algorithm.

Instant messaging is very popular with businesses and individuals since it has instant communication ability. As a result, Internet security has become a pressing and important topic for discussion. Therefore, in recent years, a lot of attention has been drawn towards Internet security and the various attacks carried out by hackers over the Internet. People today often handle affairs via the Internet. For instance, instead of the conventional letter, they communicate with others by e-mails; they chat with friends through an instant messenger; find information by browsing Websites instead of going to the library; perform e-commerce transactions through the Internet, etc. Although the convenience of the Internet makes our life easier, it is also a threat to Internet security. For instance, a business email intercepted during its transmission may let slip business confidentiality; file transfers via instant messengers may also be intercepted, and then implanted with backdoor malwares; conversations via instant messengers could be eavesdropped. Furthermore, ID and password theft may lose us money when using Internet bank service. Attackers on the Internet use hacking tricks to damage systems while users are connected to the Internet. These threats along with possible careless disclosure of business information make instant messaging a very unsafe method of communication for businesses. The paper divides hacking tricks into three categories: (1) Trojan programs that share files via instant messenger; (2) phishing or fraud via e-mails; and (3) fake Websites","","0-7695-2736-1","","10.1109/PDCAT.2006.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032223","Firewall;Hacking tricks;Intrusion detection system.;Phishing;Trojan programs","Business communication;Communication system control;Computer crime;Computer hacking;Electronic mail;Information management;Information security;Internet;National security;Peer to peer computing","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;electronic messaging;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","Internet security;Trojan programs;backdoor malwares;email;firewall;hacking;instant messaging;intrusion detection;phishing","","1","","9","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: ""Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise"". To do so, we will take the language which is realized by Jonathan Rouzauld Cornabas to modelize the system's entities to protect. This paper represents only the idea on which we will base on, in order to design an effective IDS in the operating system running in user space.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237318","intrusion detection system;realtime system;security;security properties","Access control;Computational modeling;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","cryptography;firewalls;information systems;operating systems (computers)","IDS;anomaly approach;cryptography;firewalls;information assurance;information systems;intrusion detection system;misuse approach;operating system;security properties","","0","","","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, an early review of danger theory, an approach of artificial immune system is performed to seek the possibility it can be applied in outbreak detection. To investigate that, a detection model based on danger theory is developed and the model is tested with dengue outbreak dataset. The model is then evaluated in term of detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, and accuracy.

One of the most important features of security devices such as IDSs, AVSs and D-MASs, is how accurately they identify and document threats. By nature, these security devices are difficult to test since they are test systems themselves. The attackers are the testers trying to find test cases that cannot be identified by these systems. Consequently, thorough testing models are required by developers to assess the accuracy of D-MASs, an area in which very little theoretical and empirical work exists. In this paper, we lay out the basis of D-MASs accuracy assessment and we present an evaluation of eight of these systems. We propose test coverage criteria, oracle types and specifications to assess the accuracy of D-MASs. Results show that our approach is efficient at identifying accuracy problems in several D-MASs.","","978-1-4577-1906-6","","10.1109/ICST.2012.183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200195","Malware analysis;evaluation;testing","Accuracy;Internet;Malware;Software;Testing;Vectors","invasive software;program diagnostics;program testing","D-MAS accuracy assessment;assess specifications;computer systems infection;document identification;document threats;dynamic malware analysis systems;malicious software;oracle types;sandbox;security devices;test coverage criteria;test systems","","0","","8","","","17-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examination of industry practice has revealed that increased data volume, as a result of increased communication, diminishes the efficiency of deep packet inspections (DPI). DPI is essential in protecting the cloud against malicious threats such as web exploits, zeroday attacks, data exfiltration, and malware based botnets. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of a new utility that was developed to improve retrospective packet analysis which was tested against actual data center traffic from a large regional Internet Access Provider providing cloud services. Blitzdump is a lightning fast network data packet capture utility developed to improve network intrusion detection through deep packet inspection analysis. Implementation results indicate it outperformed existing techniques, in terms of query function performance, that ultimately improved efficiency in query responses by up to 6000%.

Recently there is a trend that many DDoS attacks utilize Internet relay chat (IRC) infrastructures as the communication channels. In this paper we propose an intrusion surveillance system (ISS) to detect IRC-based DDoS attacks. The main functions of ISS are to observe network conditions, gather intelligence from distributed sources, and determine what potential attacks will likely happen. We give the detailed design of ISS in this paper. We also implement this system by using a new approach of text-based decision making - distributed preference-based surveillance (DPBS) algorithm.

"Correlated Differential Privacy: Hiding Information in Non-IID Data Set","Tianqing Zhu; Ping Xiong; Gang Li; Wanlei Zhou","Sch. of Inf.

Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as correlated information and the data set is defined as correlated data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a correlated data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the correlated data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in correlated data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective correlated differential privacy solution by defining the correlated sensitivity and designing a correlated data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the correlated levels between records, the proposed correlated sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The correlated data releasing mechanism correlated iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed correlated differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a correlated data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the correlated differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2368363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949097","Correlated Dataset;Differential Privacy;Non-IID Dataset;Privacy Preserving;Privacy preserving;correlated dataset;differential privacy;non-IID dataset","Correlation;Couplings;Data privacy;Histograms;Noise;Privacy;Sensitivity","data encapsulation;data mining;data privacy;iterative methods","correlated data releasing mechanism;correlated data set;correlated differential privacy solution;correlated information;correlated iteration mechanism;correlated levels;correlated sensitivity;data mining;data release;influential privacy notion;information hiding;iterative method;non-IID data set;privacy guarantee;privacy preserving;privacy violation;traditional global sensitivity","","0","","17","","2014-11-06","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Wireless ad hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks (DoS) due to their open decentralized architecture, highly dynamic topology and shared wireless medium in which they exist. One of the primary concerns with respect to ad hoc networks is to provide secure communication among mobile nodes in a hostile environment. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and response system called Routeguard. Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network. The presented intrusion detection scheme produces a more natural system, which is more capable of dealing with malicious or suspected nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that this scheme improves network throughput by smartly classifying the nodes into different categories depending on their current actions and previous history.","","0-7803-9181-0","","10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512922","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Protection;Throughput;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","Routeguard;communication security;denial of service attacks;dynamic topology;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;network throughput improvement;response system","","2","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used to detect the intrusion. Its prime function is to detect the intrusion and respond in timely manner. In other words, IDS function is limited to detection as well as response. The IDS is unable to capture the state of the system when an intrusion is detected. Hence, it fails to preserve the evidences against the attack in original form. To maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later examination, new security strategy is very much needed. In this research work, automated Digital Forensic Technique with Intrusion Detection System is proposed. Once an IDS detects an intrusion, it sends an alert message to administrator followed by invoke the digital forensic tool to capture the state of the system.

Our MCA-based DoS attack detection system employs the principle of anomaly based detection in attack recognition. This makes our solution capable of detecting known and unknown DoS attacks effectively by learning the patterns of legitimate network traffic only.

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host level and/or network level, but these options have some important drawbacks: antivirus, anti-spyware and personal firewalls are ineffective in the detection of hosts that are compromised via new or target-specific malicious software, while network firewalls and intrusion detection systems were developed to protect the network from external attacks but they were not designed to detect and protect against vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by ""licit"" and ""illicit"" network applications. The evaluation of the proposed methodology relies on traffic traces obtained in a controlled environment and composed by licit traffic measured from normal activity of network applications and malicious traffic synthetically generated using the subseven backdoor.

It includes additional secure parameter such as secret key and maximum transmission power which is known only to the sender and recipient node. The advantage of the proposed routing protocol is that it increases privacy of the message as well as it maintains the energy efficiency of the node.","","978-1-4799-4191-9","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992982","AdHoc;Group Signature;Manet;PPSEER;PRISM","Ad hoc networks;Energy efficiency;Privacy;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;energy conservation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","ad hoc network;encryption;group signature;maximum transmission power;network node;privacy protecting secure;recipient node;secret key;secure parameter;security based energy efficient routing protocol;sender node;underlying routing protocol","","0","","11","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure. In this article, we survey the up-to-date secure routing schemes. that appeared over the last few years.

This moves automation networks from outdated, proprietary, closed networks to the more current arena of Information Technology (IT). However, while gaining all of the cost and performance benefits of IT, existing IT security challenges are acquired as well. The power grid automation network has inherent security risks due to the fact that the systems and applications in the network were not originally designed for the general IT environment. In this paper, we propose a conceptual layered framework for protecting power grid automation systems against cyber attacks. The following factors are taken into account: 1) integration with existing, legacy systems in a non-intrusive fashion; 2) desirable performance in terms of modularity, scalability, extendibility, and manageability; 3) alignment to the Â¿Roadmap to Secure Control Systems in the Energy SectorÂ¿ and the future intelligent power delivery systems.

Intruders can exploit the large amount of cloud resources for their attacks. Most of the current security technologies do not provide the essential security features for cloud systems such as early warnings about future ongoing attacks, autonomic prevention actions, and risk measure. This paper discusses the integration of these three features to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF). The early warnings are signaled through a new finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that captures the interaction between the attackers and cloud assets. The risk assessment model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The estimated risk of each security alert is updated dynamically as the alert is correlated to prior ones. This enables the adaptive risk metric to evaluate the cloud's overall security state. The prediction system raises early warnings about potential attacks to the autonomic component, controller. Thus, the controller can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments, both risk metric and prediction model have successfully signaled early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. This gives the system administrator or an autonomic controller ample time to take preventive measures.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073270","Autonomic response;HMM;Intrusion prevention;cloud computing;early warning;intrusion prediction;online risk assessment","Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Risk management;Security;Vectors","cloud computing;hidden Markov models;probability;risk management;security of data;virtualisation","ACIDF;LLDDoS1.0 attack;adaptive risk metric;autonomic cloud intrusion detection framework;autonomic cloud intrusion prevention systems;autonomic prevention actions;cloud infrastructure;early warnings;finite state hidden Markov prediction model;occurrence probability;online risk assessment model;prediction system;preventive measures;proactive corrective actions;risk measure;security technologies;virtualization","","0","","20","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It does not require installation of any additional hardware and extra communication costs; its computational requirements are negligible. The proposed technique ma be used in both hierarchical and flat WSNs. The paper contains recommendations to the choice of threshold value for each traffic parameter.

"Variable-Length Hashing for Exact Pattern Matching","Pnevmatikatos, D.; Arelakis, A.","Inst. of Comput. Sci., Heraklion","Field Programmable Logic and Applications, 2006. FPL '06. International Conference on","20070402","2006","","","1","6","HashMem is a memory based, exact pattern matching architecture for Snort-like intrusion detection. It uses CRC- style functions to determine a unique location for a possible match and then matches the input against the pattern stored in the specified memory location. This approach achieves is a very low logic and a reasonable memory cost. In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character.

Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic.

To improve the detection of attacks, sharing data among distributed nodes or terminals and collaborating on a decision is key. This paper presents a distributed and collaborative intrusion detection (DaCID) system that relies on Dempster Shafer theory of evidence for fusing data from multiple nodes. In this approach the detection is done collaboratively and the decision is distributed among all nodes. DaCID is more robust than other systems since it is completely distributed and the decision is made autonomously at each node. Simulation results demonstrated that DaCID's performance approaches that of a centralized method.","","978-1-4244-1772-8","978-1-4244-1754-4","10.1109/LCW.2008.4545399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545399","Collaborative;Dempster Shafer;Denial of Service;Distributed;Intrusion detection","Cats;Collaboration;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Distributed computing;Floods;Intrusion detection;Robustness","case-based reasoning;computer networks;groupware;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","Dempster Shafer evidence theory;collaborative intrusion detection systems;data fusion;data sharing;distributed intrusion detection systems;network security","","2","","17","","","31-31 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A botnet is a group of Internet-connected computer programs communicating with other similar programs in order to perform various attacks. HTTP-based botnet is most dangerous botnet among all the different botnets available today. In botnets detection, in particularly, behavioural-based approaches suffer from the unavailability of the benchmark datasets and this lead to lack of precise results evaluation of botnet detection systems, comparison, and deployment which originates from the deficiency of adequate datasets. Most of the datasets in the botnet field are from local environment and cannot be used in the large scale due to privacy problems and do not reflect common trends, and also lack some statistical features. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any benchmark dataset available which is infected by HTTP-based botnet (HBB) for performing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Web servers by using HTTP-GET flooding method. In addition, there is no Web access log infected by botnet is available for researchers. Therefore, in this paper, a complete test-bed will be illustrated in order to implement a real time HTTP-based botnet for performing variety of DDoS attacks against Web servers by using HTTP-GET flooding method. In addition to this, Web access log with http bot traces are also generated. These real time datasets and Web access logs can be useful to study the behaviour of HTTP-based botnet as well as to evaluate different solutions proposed to detect HTTP-based botnet by various researchers.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779162","Botnet;Cyber attacks;DDoS attacks;HTTP flooding;HTTP-based botnet","Computer crime;Floods;Intrusion detection;Web servers","invasive software","DDoS attacks;HBB testbed;HTTP-GET flooding method;Internet-connected computer programs;Web access log;Web servers;behavioural-based approaches;botnet detection systems;cyber attacks;distributed denial of service attacks;http bot traces;malware;real time HTTP-based botnet","","1","","27","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing information security in this distributed network-centric environment is a significant challenge. System users must be confident that their critical data is protected. Competing requirements, the transportation of sensitive data and air-to-ground bandwidth constraints mean that a network layer-based approach to security is no longer sufficient. Trusted security at every layer of a network-centric architecture - combined with strong identity management and a data-oriented approach to information assurance - is the key to success.

We propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network. The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised, the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues. We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property, i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security. Finally, we present the simulation results to justify the feasibility and evaluate the effectiveness of SPREAD.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354662","","Application software;Computer network reliability;Computer security;Cryptography;Data security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET;SPREAD scheme;data confidentiality service;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing technique;multiple independent path;path set optimization algorithm;secret message protection;secret sharing scheme;security protocol for reliable data delivery","","64","","26","","","7-11 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this paper is then to propose application of XML-based integrated network management techniques to support collaboration for the purpose of post-IDS alert analysis, and discuss corresponding issues about unified representation of information and knowledge.

Despite the marketing hype around “the cloud”, the paradigm itself is in a critical transition state from the laboratories to mass market. Many technical and business aspects of cloud computing need to mature before it is widely adopted for corporate use. For example, the inability to seamlessly burst between internal cloud and external cloud platforms, termed cloud bursting, is a significant shortcoming of current cloud solutions. Furthermore, the absence of a capability that would allow to broker between multiple cloud providers or to aggregate them into a composite service inhibits the free and open competition that would help the market mature. This paper describes the concepts of cloud bursting and cloud brokerage and discusses the open management and security issues associated with the two models. It also presents a possible architectural framework capable of powering the brokerage based cloud services that is currently being developed in the scope of OPTIMIS, an EU FP7 project.","","978-1-4244-9397-5","","10.1109/ECOWS.2010.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5693261","Cloud Brokering;Cloud Bursting;Cloud Computing;Cloud Federation","","cloud computing;service-oriented architecture","IT industry;IT resources;architectural framework;cloud brokerage;cloud bursting;cloud computing;open management","","24","","11","","","1-3 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Combining static and dynamic analyses, we propose an integrated architecture to defend against surveillance spyware in this paper. Features extracted from both static and dynamic analyses are ranked according to their information gains. Then using top significant features we construct a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for each client. In order to keep the classifier update-to-date, there is a machine playing as server to collect reports from all clients, retrain, and redistribute the new classifier to each client. Our surveillance spyware detection system (SSDS) has an overall accuracy rate up to 97.9% for known surveillance spywares and 96.4% for unknown ones.","","0-7803-9487-9","","10.1109/CEC.2006.1688720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688720","","Advertising;Computer displays;Computer hacking;Computer science;Data mining;Feature extraction;Information analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Surveillance","data mining;security of data;support vector machines","data mining methods;information gains;support vector machine classifier;surveillance spyware detection system","","3","","20","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This novel perimeter solution is designed to be sufficiently flexible for implementation at a wide range of facility types, from high security military or government installations to commercial power plants, to industrial facilities of various kinds. A prototype section of barrier has been produced and installed at the Sandia Exterior Intrusion Sensor Testing Facility in Albuquerque, NM. The prototype was implemented with a robust vehicle barrier and coupled with a variety of detection and assessment solutions to demonstrate both the effectiveness of such a solution, as well as the flexibility of the system. In this implementation, infrared sensors and fence disturbance sensors are coupled with a video motion detection sensor and ground sensors. The ability of the system to properly detect pedestrian or vehicle attempts to bypass, breach, or otherwise defeat the system will be characterized, as well as the Nuisance Alarm Rate.","1071-6572","978-1-4673-2450-2","978-1-4673-2449-6","10.1109/CCST.2012.6393535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393535","NAR;SEIWG;SOA;VMD;detection;machine learning;perimeter security;sensor fusion","Laboratories;Photonics;Poles and towers;Prototypes;Security;Vehicles","alarm systems;infrared detectors;object detection;research and development;sensor fusion;testing;video cameras","PIDAS;access delay;fence disturbance sensors;ground sensors;infrared sensors;integrated perimeter security;nuisance alarm rate;performance testing;perimeter integrated detection and assessment system;research and development;robust vehicle barrier;sensor fusion;video motion detection sensor","","1","","5","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, we show that DNS-based selection of CDN servers can be refined to fully deliver on the speedup of CDNs. We propose DNS-Proxy (dp), a client-side process that shares load-balancing functionality with CDNs by choosing from among resolved CDN servers based on last mile network performance. Our measurement study of CDN infrastructure deployed by five major CDN providers shows that dp reduces webpage load time by 29% on average. If dp has already resolved the domain, the reduction in webpage load time is as much as 40%. Finally, dp reduces the load time of individual static Web objects by as much as 43%. We argue that dp enables a more effective use of existing content delivery infrastructure and represents a complementary strategy to a continual increase of geographic content availability.","","","","10.1109/ICCCN.2015.7288411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288411","","Asia;Google;IP networks;Image resolution;North America;Servers;Time measurement","Internet;Web sites;client-server systems;resource allocation","DNS-based CDN server selection;Webpage load time reduction;client-assisted CDN server selection Website;content delivery network;load balancing;static Web object","","","","","","","3-6 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One attractive technique for identifying potential Internet threats is detecting previously unknown, but common sub-strings that appear very frequently in data packets. In this paper, we propose a novel architectural platform that thoroughly analyzes the network traffic behavior in terms of repetitions to identify potential Internet threats. The main idea is to use a two-phase hashing system and small memory units functioning in parallel to achieve a high-throughput and memory efficient behavioral analysis engine. The system performs behavioral analysis on selected information/user(s) and builds a bell-shaped curve for normal traffic using parallel counters. Our traffic behavioral analysis system has been fully prototyped on Altera Stratix FPGA. Experimental results verify that our system can support line speed of gigabit-rates with very negligible false positive and negative rates.","","978-1-4244-5175-3","978-1-4244-5176-0","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421828","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421828","","Counting circuits;IP networks;Information analysis;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Search engines;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical)","Internet;cryptography;normal distribution;storage management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Altera Stratix FPGA;Internet threat;memory efficient behavioral analysis engine;memory unit;network intrusion detection;network throughput;network traffic behavior;normal distribution;parallel counter;two-phase hashing system","","0","","21","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thanks to the rapid development of the Internet and ubiquitous technologies including mobile devices such as smart phones, mobile phones and tablet PCs, the quality of our lives has been greatly influenced and rapidly changed in recent years. Internet users have exponentially increased as well. Meanwhile, the explosive growth of teletraffic called big data for user services threatens the current networks, and we face menaces from various kinds of intrusive incidents through the Internet. A variety of network attacks on network resources have continuously caused serious damage. Thus, active and advanced technologies for early detecting of anomaly teletraffic on Hadoop-based platforms are required.
