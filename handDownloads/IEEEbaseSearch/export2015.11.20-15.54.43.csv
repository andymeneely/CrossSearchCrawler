While several giant public cloud providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Google are competing to extend their market, there is still a large number of organizations asking higher level of privacy and control over cloud solutions. Therefore, the need to have private cloud solutions is obvious. To overcome this need there are several on-going open source software frameworks for building public and private clouds. Among them, Open Stack and Cloud Stack are growing at fast pace and gaining more attention. An analysis on these software stacks is necessary in order to choose the most suitable solution that matches an enterprise's requirements.

In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection system, which uses the Dempster-Shafer's theory of evidence to fuse local information. Our approach is composed of 2 layers: the lower layer consists of both host and network based sensors, which are specifically designed to collect local features and make local decisions to differentiate those easy-to-detect attacks; the upper layer is a fusion control center, it makes global decisions on those locally uncertain events by adopting Dempster's combination rule. Our approach gains the advantages of both host and network based intrusion methods, and can practice both rule-based and anomaly detection. A simulation is carried out and result shows that the multi-sensor data fusion model performs much better than single sensor.","","0-7803-8273-0","","10.1109/WCICA.2004.1342330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1342330","","Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Fuses;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Sensor fusion;Sensor phenomena and characterization","distributed processing;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;security of data;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;anomaly detection;combination rule;distributed intrusion detection system;fusion control;information fusion;information security;multisensor data fusion model;rule based detection","","6","","15","","","15-19 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless communication offers the benefits of low cost, rapid deployment, shared communication medium, and mobility; at the same time, it causes many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as “1” and the other is marked as “0.” During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the updating of the dynamic encryption key.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2264537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584806","Dynamic secret-based encryption;ZigBee;retransmission;security;smart grid;wireless communication","Encryption;Monitoring;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Zigbee;cryptography;power system security;smart power grids","ZigBee protocol;dynamic encryption key;dynamic secret;encryption scheme;power system;retransmission sequence;security problems;shared communication medium;smart grid wireless communication","","3","","29","","2013-08-22","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding). In our proposed system, any intrusion activity will cause significant variations, thereby causing a large error, while a minor aberration in the variations (concept drift) w- ll not be immediately reported as alert.","","978-1-4577-1375-0","","10.1109/THS.2011.6107850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107850","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems;Concept Drift;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Engines;Entropy;Feedback control;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Kullback-Leibler divergence;ROC curve;adapting ROC thresholding;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;concept drift detection;concept-drifting data stream mining;control theoretic model;entropy measurement scheme;feedback control engine;incremental anomaly based detection;network attack;normal traffic pattern profile;receiver operating characteristic curve;supervised machine learning;support vector machine based classifier;user activity","","1","","21","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms.

Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) that automatically generate and apply protection to client systems have been proposed as a solution. Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security system that monitors computer systems and network traffic, analyze that traffic to identify possible security breaches and raise alerts. An IDS triggers thousands of alerts per day which is difficult for human users to analyze them and take appropriate actions. It is important to reduce the false alarm alerts, intelligently integrate and correlate them in order to present a high level view of the detected security issue to the administrator. In this paper an hybrid model has been proposed in which intrusion detection takes place with the help Dendritic Cell Algorithm and Dempester belief theory along with SVM classification algorithms. It made the Intrusion Detection System much more efficient and accurate as compared to the existing System. It also seems to be an improvement in precise value of proper alarm generation to enhance the performance of the system.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726835","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726835","DCA;Dempster-belif theory;IDS;SVM","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Filtering;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines","Internet;artificial immune systems;authorisation;belief networks;inference mechanisms;pattern classification;support vector machines","Dempster belief theory;IDS;Internet;SVM classification algorithms;alarm generation;belief function;communication network;computer system monitoring;dendritic cell algorithm;hybrid artificial immune system;information system;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;network traffic monitoring;security breaches;security system;unauthorized access","","0","","13","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations. Furthermore, there is no bypass of our access control since our ACM is placed inside VMM which is simple and small enough to verify its safety and we eliminated the chance of VMM corruption by checking integrity of VMM including ACM during bootstrap time.","","978-1-4244-1456-7","978-1-4244-1457-4","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446361","","Access control;Availability;Batteries;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;File systems;Protection;Safety;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;mobile computing;monitoring;virtual machines","DoS attacks;mobile devices;mobile threats;multilayer mandatory access control mechanism;system virtualization technology;virtual machine monitor","","8","","26","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.","","978-0-7695-3501-2","","10.1109/CMC.2009.325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797305","Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian game approach;DoS attacks;Nash equilibrium;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes;network defense strategy;node interaction;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor networks","","2","","13","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A SWLAN provides extremely secure mobile wireless data communication with COMSEC, TRANSEC, and monitoring systems to detect PHY and MAC layer misbehavior. However, the SWLAN cannot mitigate a smart jammer that transmits back-to-back packets on the detected channel after scanning all of the channels until a legitimate communication hops to a new channel. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive rapid channel-hopping scheme using Dwell Window and a Deception Mechanism to mitigate smart jammer attacks. The Dwell Window is a novel concept to adjust transmission time based on jammer's capability. The Deception Mechanism is another novel concept to force the jammer to attack an inactive channel by deceiving the jammer.

However the attacker is likely to attempt to reenter the system, and if the attacker succeeds in reentering, it might take some time for the defender's intrusion detection system (IDS) to re-detect the attacker's presence. In this interaction, both the attacker and defender are learning about each other - their vulnerabilities, intentions, and methods. Moreover, during periods when the attacker has reentered the system undetected, he is likely learning faster than the defender. The more the attacker learns, the greater the chance that he succeeds in his objective - whether it be stealing information, inserting malware, or some other objective. Conversely, the greater the defender's knowledge, the more likely that the defender can prevent the attacker from succeeding. In this setting, we study the defender's optimal strategy for expelling or not expelling an intruder. We find that the policy of always expelling the attacker can be far from optimal. Furthermore, by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), we find how the optimal decision depends on the state variables and model parameters that characterize the IDS's detection rate and the attacker's persistence.","","978-1-4244-5870-7","","10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394923","","Computer security;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection","Markov processes;decision theory;information systems;invasive software","Markov decision process;attacker detection;attacker expelling;information system;intrusion detection system;malware","","0","","12","","","Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques. The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292933","","Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers)","computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet;classification task;entropy;features extraction;genetic-based rule learning technique;interval-based representation;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network attacks;network intrusion detection;network traffic;prevention schemes;reliable computer networks;secure computer networks;security breaches monitoring;security mechanism;statistical features;statistical rule learning approach;volume-based approach","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After only a few years, an organization's Internet infrastructure is likely to need a major overhaul. In late 2001, the systems architecture team to which I belong took on these issues for an organization that wanted to rebuild its Web infrastructure. The existing infrastructure contained multiple single points of failure, could not scale to expected usage patterns, was built on proprietary systems, and had a high management overhead. The legacy infrastructure had grown organically over the previous five years as administrators added unplanned features and functionality, and usage had grown 100-fold since the specifications were initially developed. Because of the age and condition of the legacy systems, we decided to redesign the solution from scratch to overcome the inherent limitations. This case study describes the process our systems architecture team followed for designing and deploying the new architecture.

In order to delete the redundant and noisy features, improve the performance of IDS, we present an efficient IDS based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) method. Kernel methods are the effective approaches to intrusion detection problems. MKL methods combined with support vector machines (SVMs) can overcome some practice difficulties of IDS such as irregular data, non-flat distribution of the samples, etc. Experiments on the KDD Cup (1999) intrusion detection data set show that MKL methods have a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate compared to single kernel methods.","","978-1-4244-6791-4","","10.1109/ISKE.2010.5680860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680860","Intrusion Detection System;feature selection;kernel method;multiple kernel learning;support vector machine","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","SVM;data representation;intrusion detection system;kernel learning method;network anomaly detection;support vector machines","","1","","10","","","15-16 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal, we formulate a repeated non-cooperative game between an attacker and a HIDS. The solution leads the HIDS to find the optimal number of objects that should be monitored and the corresponding monitored time. We study the case of multiple-step attack to gain more insight of the solution for this game model. Therefore, our model considers the tradeoff between the detection accuracy and the resource consumption. Analysis and simulation results prove that our approach can effectively decrease the resource consumption of the HIDS taking into consideration the detection accuracy.","","978-0-7695-3393-3","978-0-7695-3393-3","10.1109/WiMob.2008.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654280","Game theory;Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems;resources consumption","Analytical models;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Probes;Systems engineering and theory","game theory;security of data","HIDS;game theoretic approach;host-based intrusion detection system;multiple-step attack;resource consumption","","1","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In response, ShanghaiGrid (SG) aims to providing abundant information services to the public. With fixed schedule and urban-wide coverage, an appealing service in SG is to provide free message delivery service to the public using buses, which allows mobile device users to send messages to locations of interest via buses. The main challenge in realizing this service is to provide efficient routing scheme with privacy preservation under highly dynamic urban traffic condition. In this paper, we present an innovative scheme BusCast to tackle this problem. In BusCast, buses can pick up and forward personal messages to their destination locations in a store-carry-forward fashion. For each message, BusCast conservatively associates a routing graph rather than a fixed routing path with the message in order to adapt the dynamic of urban traffic. Meanwhile, the privacy information about the user and the message destination is concealed from both intermediate relay buses and outside adversaries. Both rigorous privacy analysis and extensive trace-driven simulations demonstrate the efficacy of BusCast scheme.","","","","10.1109/PADSW.2014.7097847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7097847","anonymous communication;backward unlinkability;message delivery;traffic analysis attacks;vehicular networks","Bismuth;Delays;Relays;Routing","data privacy;traffic engineering computing;transportation","BusCast scheme;ShanghaiGrid;information service;intelligent mobile device;message destination;privacy analysis;privacy information;privacy preserving message delivery;routing graph;routing scheme;trace-driven simulation;urban bus;urban traffic condition","","0","","16","","","16-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic. The memory overhead added by the algorithm was limited to 0.11%.","","978-1-4577-1125-1","","10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088148","Bloom filters;Snort;intrusion detection;network security;pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Pulse width modulation;Vectors","pattern matching;security of data","Exscind algorithm;Wu-Manber pattern matching;exclusion filter;inclusion filter;signature-based intrusion detection systems;software-based pattern matching","","1","","28","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using these systems, it is difficult to understand the source of attack, the diffusion of the attack, or the relation between the target and the source of the attack. This paper described a method for visualizing cyber threats by using 2-dimensional matrix representation of IP addresses. The advantages of this method are that: (1) the logical distance of IP addresses is represented intuitively; (2) Internet address space is visualized economically; (3) macroscopic information (Internet level) and microscopic information (local level) are visualized simultaneously.

The disallowable policy enforcers alert on events that are known to be bad while the allowable policy enforcers monitor events that deviate from known good. Nevertheless, sophisticated cases of computer attacks often render attempts to isolate failed attacks from successful attacks ineffective. Thus, attacks are erroneous interpreted and most successful cases of computer attacks are not forestalled while in progress despite the huge volume of warnings that intrusion detectors generate beforehand.

The agents are made responsible for alerting the system administrators about an attempted intrusion or misuse of a particular system. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of reports of such attacks, which are widespread across the network and affect a chain of systems before they attack the actual target system. To detect such attacks, the amount of information associated within a single isolated system is inadequate for an agent to confirm an intrusion. Therefore, the need is emphasized for a framework that allows the agents to negotiate with their co-agents in order to share information about an intrusion, thereby aiding in the effective handling of intrusion detection. Our design aims at developing such a framework in the FIPA-OS (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents - Open Source) environment, which provides most of the source code for building agents on its platform. The concept of mutual co-operation among agents has been developed as a means of querying. These queries are carried out by tasks associated with each agent. The protocols to support these interactions by means of the queries are explained.

Honey nets are deployed for the purpose of tracking malicious activities and learn about hackers' origin, methods and attacks. However, today's Honey nets produce an enormous amount of data which becomes a challenge to analyze. In this paper, we attempt to separate and identify scanning traffic from other types of traffic. To accomplish this, we have developed a tool that utilizes known data mining techniques to find the scanning activities in Honey net data, which is an aggregate traffic data collected by multiple Honey pots. Being able to identify scanning activities will allow security analysts to focus more on other types of traffic, and hence be able to study and analyze other types of attacks.","","978-1-4577-0975-3","978-0-7695-4482-3","10.1109/CICSyN.2011.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005682","Data Mining;Honeynet;Intrusion Detection;Scanning","Data mining;Feature extraction;IP networks;Machine learning;Probes;Servers;Time series analysis","alarm systems;computerised monitoring;data mining;security of data","Honey pots;Honeynet data;aggregate traffic data;business;data mining;early warning system;enumeration activity;financial benefits;hacker origin;malicious activity tracking;open services;production network scanning activity;security analysts;unauthorized access;vulnerable software","","0","","23","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intrusion detection rate of the transportation information security system is often affected by the structure parameter design of the support vector machine (SVM) model. Improper SVM model design may lead to a low detection precision. To overcome these problems, a new intrusion detection method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SVM is proposed in this paper. The KPCA was adopted to obtain the useful features of the original data to eliminate the redundancy. Then the PSO was employed to optimize the training procedure of the SVM. Thus, satisfactory SVM model with good extendable ability was attained. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the KDD dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods, and thus is available for the transportation information security.","","978-1-4577-0855-8","","10.1109/PACCS.2011.5990290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990290","","Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Support vector machines;Transportation","particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines;transportation","KDD dataset;improved SVM model;intrusion detection;kernel principal component analysis;particle swarm optimization;support vector machine;transportation information security systems","","3","","8","","","17-18 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present the main results of a PhD Dissertation that addressed the challenge of providing service providers with adequate service and device management mechanisms. First, we extended the industry de facto standard for remote management of devices and services on the customer's premises (the CWMP/TR069 framework), in order to increase its scope and flexibility. Afterwards, on top of those extensions, we proposed and investigated an array of innovative approaches for device, service, desktop and security management.

E-FCMs are suggested by Hagiwara to represent causal relationships more naturally. The main differences between E-FCMs and conventional Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are the following: E-FCMs have nonlinear membership functions, conditional weights, and time delay weights. Therefore E-FCMs are suitable for risk analysis as all features of E-FCMs are more informative and can fit the needs of Risk Analysis. In this paper we suggest a framework to analyze risks using E-FCMs and extend E-FCMs themselves by introducing a special graphical representation for risk analysis.

We propose a memory-efficient multiple-character-approaching architecture consisting of multiple parallel deterministic finite automata (DFAs), called TDP-DFA. By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity. We also present a novel scheme to share the storage of transition rules among multiple DFAs, substantially decreasing the total storage cost, and avoiding the cost increase being proportional to the number of DFAs. We evaluate this design through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments.

Meanwhile, modern multicore platforms are becoming performance competitive with traditional hardware solutions for PM. But due to the unbalance of network flow sizes, traditional flow- based data parallel processing/programming model can not fully exert multicore platforms' computing power and results in poor performance scalability. In this paper, a novel parallel inspection model, Dynamic Differentiated Distributed Detection (D<sup>4</sup>) is proposed. D<sup>4</sup> deploys distributed parallel operations by adding one more dimension on workload partition/allocation. It proposes an effective and efficient scheme to pre-partition the pattern set in several candidate ways, called ""Detection Modes"", and let multiple candidate PM methods to handle the subsets, respectively; the most suitable Detection Mode would be selected specifically for each incoming flows at the run-time, and the workload would be dynamically allocated among multiple CPU cores.

Current systems implementing intrusion detection processes observe traffic at several data collecting points in the network but analysis is often centralized or partly centralized. These systems are not scalable and suffer from the single point of failure, i.e. attackers only need to target the central node to compromise the whole system. This paper proposes an anomaly-based fully distributed network intrusion detection system where analysis is run at each data collecting point using a naive Bayes classifier. Probability values computed by each classifier are shared among nodes using an iterative average consensus protocol. The final analysis is performed redundantly and in parallel at the level of each data collecting point, thus avoiding the single point of failure issue. We run simulations focusing on DDoS attacks with several network configurations, comparing the accuracy of our fully distributed system with a hierarchical one. We also analyze communication costs and convergence speed during consensus phases.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292913","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Convergence;Intrusion detection;Joints;Network topology;Training","Bayes methods;computer network security;pattern classification","DDoS attacks;anomaly-based fully distributed network intrusion detection system;consensus based network intrusion detection system;data collecting point;iterative average consensus protocol;naïve Bayes classifier;probability values","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing neural network based IDS are mainly suffering from two problems: one is to determine the numbers of hidden layers and regulating weight values to configure its topology. The other is to process the large amounts of audit data. In order to increase detection rates and decrease the processing overheads, we exploit genetic algorithm (GA). The operation of GA enables IDS based on combination of PCA and BNN to increase their detection rates and decrease processing overheads. The experimental results on KDD 1999 intrusion detection dataset demonstrate the possibility of our approach","","4-88552-216-1","","10.1109/APSITT.2005.203684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593491","","Computer networks;Computer security;Genetic algorithms;Information processing;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network topology;Neural networks;Principal component analysis","backpropagation;genetic algorithms;neural nets;principal component analysis;security of data","BNN;KDD 1999 intrusion detection dataset;PCA;back-propagation neural network;detection rates;genetic algorithm;optimized intrusion detection system;principle component analysis;processing overheads","","1","","11","","","10-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Host and network security are getting more critical and more complex due to the diversified and evolved ways of attack form anyplace in Internet world. Most of the technologies been developed are focusing on protecting individual systems and limited scope of network by using different diagnosis and detection approaches. Both commercial and noncommercial solutions, called IDS (intrusion detection system), usually maintain their own proprietary databases by collecting detection patterns. In general, more patterns collected and more up-to-date of the databases surely increase the capabilities of their bundled IDS solutions. However, due to the coverage limitation and late awareness, there still have new growing uncovered breaches that single IDS would not be able to catch up. The reasons are two: 1) Any one proprietary IDS is incapable of collecting so many detection patterns daily brought up in Internet world. 2) Systems under certain proprietary IDS's protection are unable to get instant notification of new detection patterns, most of which are discovered by other IDSs. In order to reduce the risks of coverage limitation and time delay of new types of attack, a joint defense service framework is been proposed, which work as human nervous system to protect every nodes within the system at all.","","0-7803-7882-2","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297610","","Databases;Delay effects;Explosives;Humans;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Nervous system;Neurons;Protection","Internet;authorisation;database management systems;neural nets;safety systems","Internet connectivity;e-service;joint defense service framework;network intrusion detection system;neuron security;proprietary databases","","0","","5","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This will make cloud computing a potential target for cyber attacks. Most proposed security models for virtualization are working above virtualization on host OS. Almost all proposed cloud security models suffers from this problem in that these models have very limited control over virtualization. In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS. To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar model or implementation like HSVM, able to protect the cloud from DDoS attack, unauthorized access, data leakage as well.","","978-1-4673-1425-1","","10.1109/CyberSec.2012.6246117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246117","Cloud computing;Virtual Machine;Virtual Machine Monitor;intrusion detection system;secure virtualication;security","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","Web services;cloud computing;security of data","DDoS attack;HSVM;IaaS;PaaS;SaaS;cloud computing;cloud security models;cloud service models;cloud vendor control level;cyber attacks;dSaaS;data leakage;data storage as a service;guest OS;hierarchical secure virtualization model;host OS;infrastructure as a service;on-demand resources;platform as a service;service as a software;threat quarantine;unauthorized access","","1","","25","","","26-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
