More specifically, each HIDS evaluates both the false positive (FP) rate and false negative (FN) rate of its neighboring HIDSes' opinions about intrusions using Bayesian learning, and aggregates their opinions about intrusions using a Bayesian decision model. Our dynamic acquaintance management algorithm allows each HIDS to effectively select a set of collaborators. We evaluate our system based on a simulated collaborative HIDS network.

In these applications, delivering information to multiple receivers at the same time makes multicast communication is the next generation dominated data transmission mechanism in mobile ad hoc networks. In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study. Analytical results compare with NS2 simulation results that prove the validity of analytical models. This empirical study illustrates the importance of designing smarter internal attacker detection mechanism to protect multicast routing protocols from the above-mentioned intelligent internal attacks.","","978-1-4799-8466-4","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229740","Byzantine attacks;IDS;MANET;MAODV;attacker prevention technique;internal attacks;multicast","Analytical models;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","access protocols;bandwidth allocation;computer network security;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","Byzantine attack;MAC layer;MANET;MAODV;bandwidth utilization;collision avoidance mechanism;denial of service attack;information delivery;intelligent internal attack;intelligent stealthy attack;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;multicast communication;multicast routing protocol;multicast tree;next generation data transmission mechanism;smarter internal attacker detection mechanism design","","0","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research paper, we explore the plausibility of an attacker or hacker exploiting one of the most popular and commonly used VoIP protocol - Session Initiation protocol (SIP). Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] being derived from HTTP has its own share of strengths and weaknesses. While it constitutes the provisioning of critical and business relevant services e.g. IP Telephony, Instant Messaging, Presence, etc., it is vulnerable to well known and not so well known attacks. This research paper identifies and describes security issues significant to SIP protocol that may lead to Denial of Service (DoS) [2], flooding attacks, attacks exploiting vulnerabilities at the application layer and Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT). In this paper we explore the various security issues pertinent to SIP protocol and diverse ways in which a VoIP system leveraging SIP can be attacked.

In this study, we propose a simple and uniform framework for the assessment of security, availability, and reliability that arbitrary compositions of security measures can provide. Our methodology facilitates system modeling in a decision-theoretic manner, which makes the models easily understandable even for specialists from fields other than security.

Nevertheless, existing technologies are insufficient as primitives for end-host security. For example, Berkeley packet filter (BPF), the most popular monitoring infrastructure for many Unix systems, is intended for packet capturing at physical interfaces, and thus, not appropriate for monitoring of applications, which is sometimes critical for system security. This paper presents a simple solution to the problem, utilizing hierarchical virtual network interface (VIF) mechanism. VIF is a new OS abstraction that can be hierarchically structured and attached to OS entities to control their network I/O. We extend VIFs to allow filtering and monitoring of their traffic, and show that it has desirable properties for end-host monitoring and control of traffic. We present our prototype implementation on FreeBSD, and evaluate it qualitatively and quantitatively. Demonstrated advantages include: i) ability to monitor terminating entities at arbitrary granularity, ii) a single consistent framework for both network security and network quality of service, iii) OS independence, iv) efficiency as a control primitive, v) compatibility with BPF interface and its applications, and vi) flexibility for future functional expansion.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498485","","Application software;Band pass filters;Communication system traffic control;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Inspection;Intelligent networks;Peace technology;Quality of service;Traffic control","computer networks;information filters;network interfaces;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Berkeley packet filter;Netnice packet filter;QoS;Unix systems;end-host network control;network quality of service;system security;telecommunication traffic;virtual network interface mechanism","","0","","35","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Diagnosis experiments show that the system in normal pattern and abnormal pattern can be reflected by the self set and the non-self set completely through clustering algorithm. So the accuracy of diagnosis is improved. In the course of diagnosis, multiple diagnosis is proposed to process the data. If the data can't be recognized exactly, the abnormity degree is presented, which is the evidence for experts to make decision.","","978-0-7695-3063-5","","10.1109/IITA.2007.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4426988","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Detectors;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Signal processing algorithms;State-space methods","","","","0","","7","","","2-3 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Cascaded classifier approach based on Adaboost to increase detection rate of rare network attack categories","Natesan, P.; Rajesh, P.","Dept. of CSE, Kongu Eng.

Generally R2L and U2R attacks are very rare attacks and even in KDD Cup99 dataset, these attacks are only 2% of overall datasets. So, these result in model not able to efficiently learn the characteristics of rare categories and this will result in poor detection rates of rare attack categories like R2L and U2R attacks. We introduce a new approach called cascading classification model based on AdaBoost and Bayesian Network Classifier that can improve the detection rate of rare network attack categories. In this approach we train two classifiers with two different training sets. The KDD Cup99 dataset was splitted into two training sets where one contains full of non rare attacks datasets and other contains datasets of rare attack categories. This cascaded classifier approach increases the detection rates of both rare network attack categories and also it increase overall detection rate of an IDS model. The higher detection rates are due to the mitigation of the influence from the dominant categories if the rare attack categories are separated from the dataset.","","978-1-4673-1599-9","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206789","Adaboost;Bayesian Network;detection rate;dominant attacks;rare attacks","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Training","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","Adaboost;Bayesian Network Classifier;R2L attacks;U2R attacks;cascaded classifier approach;increase detection rate;network intrusion detection;rare network attack categories;unequal distributed attack","","0","","13","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This calls for monitoring solutions that operate at different layers than the application layer (services layer). In this paper we present our ongoing work towards the definition of a monitoring framework for SOAs and services, which relies on anomaly detection performed at the Application Server (AS) and the Operating System (OS) layers to identify events whose manifestation or effect is not adequately described a-priori.

ICTs on the power grids have evolved from isolated structures into open and networked environments based on TCP/IP and Ethernet. The technology is known to be vulnerable with respect to cyberintrusions. As ICTs of the power infrastructure have evolved into highly connected network environments, the use of firewalls has become a widely adopted access control method against intruders. Firewalls do not guarantee cybersecurity, however. The misconfiguration of company firewalls has been reported. Even if the configuration of a firewall is correct, it is still vulnerable because firewalls are not able to detect insider attacks and connections from the trusted side.

The process can be integrated as part of the intrusion model development process with proper tool support. This will help to identify possible errors in the intrusion model as early as possible. The contribution is to apply well-known aspects from software testing and implement them in the intrusion model testing and validation. The experimental implementation of the proposed process will concentrate on testing intrusion models focusing on detecting port scan attacks. This experiment will indicate that when the testing and validation is part of the intrusion model development process, the intrusion model developer receives immediate feedback and can quickly refine the intrusion model.

The proposed network-based intrusion detection system monitors anomalies and malicious activities of multicast messages based on IEC 61850, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Value (SV). NIDS detects anomalies and intrusions that violate predefined security rules using a specification-based algorithm. The performance test has been conducted for different cyber intrusion scenarios (e.g., packet modification, replay and denial-of-service attacks) using a cyber security testbed. The IEEE 39-bus system model has been used for testing of the proposed intrusion detection method for simultaneous cyber attacks. The false negative ratio (FNR) is the number of misclassified abnormal packets divided by the total number of abnormal packets.

The technology of intrusion detection is an important component of network security. The traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) generally has the following disadvantages: the first one is that it could not detect the new type attacks even the variation of existed attacks; the second one is the detection time is so long that the real-time capability of the system is low. In this paper we proposed a new model based on LLE and BVM to solve the problems mentioned above. This model is different from traditional IDS, we use BVM classifier to differentiate the normal and abnormal attacks, and we added a pre-process module before the classifier. In the pre-process module, we use LLE to extract the main features of the intrusion data, which is the main part of the pre-process module, and then the principal components of the data are used as input of BVM classifier that differentiates the normal and abnormal actions. Applying this proposed system to KDDCUP99 data, experimental results clearly illustrates that this model has a remarkable performance in detecting both existed instruction and new ones.","","978-1-4244-8104-0","978-1-4244-8106-4","10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636736","BVM;IDS;LLE;component;feature extraction","Databases;Probes","Internet;computer network security;pattern classification","BVM classifier;Internet;KDDCUP99 data;LLE;intrusion detection system;network attacks;network security","","0","","13","","","18-19 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From the results it could be concluded that if crossover performed is not sufficient, there is not sufficient sharing of genes. If we crossover too much, good segments of individuals get split up a lot.

Anomaly intrusion detection approaches have the advantage of detecting previously unknown or new attacks, but suffer from the possible high false alarms due to the problem of behavior drifting and the difficulty of building an adaptive model. In this paper, we propose a model based on the data mining technique - naïve Bayes classification to classify an input event (system call sequences generated from privileged processes) as “normal” or “anomalous” to detect system anomalous behavior. The independent frequency of each system call from a process collected under the normal conditions is the basis for the classifier. The ratio of the probability of a sequence from a process and the probability NOT from the process serves as the input of a fuzzy system for the classification. Experimental results in a data set consisting of both normal and intrusion traces show that the model can successfully detect most of intrusion traces with a very low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4673-1713-9","978-1-4673-1712-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377776","Anomaly Intrusion Detection;Data Mining;Fuzzy Logic;Naïve Bayes Classifiers;Privileged Processes;System Calls","Data mining;Data models;Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Training data","data mining;fuzzy logic;pattern classification;probability;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection approach;anomaly-based IDS;data mining technique;false alarm rate;fuzzy logic;input event classification;intrusion trace;misuse IDS;naive Bayes classification;probability;system call sequence","","0","","13","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New ICT and e-Learning strategies and advances in wireless standards and technologies- particularly in the areas of Bluetooth, WiFi (wireless fidelity), WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and mobile computing can help to bridge the digital divide in education and research. Using open broadband Wireless technologies and implementing mobile computing architectures, one can overcome the challenges of ground, infrastructure, and finance to increase access; deploy broadband quickly and cost-effectively to areas currently not served; and extend the benefits of digital revolution to previously unreachable populations. These technologies aim to provide low-cost, high-performance Wireless access to residential and business applications. As technology evolves to address portable and mobile applications, the required features and performance of the system will increase. Evolution toward the phase called ""full mobility"" provides incremental support for low latency, low packet loss and real-time handoff of subscriber terminals operating at high speeds. This paper presents the analogy of promising wireless technologies on different frequencies: Bluetooth, WiFi, and WiMAX. This paper is organised into four parts: part I describes the functionality and usage of Bluetooth in the wireless personal area networks, part II presents the WiFi- IEEE 802.1 In strategies for users considering higher-bandwidth alternatives to existing wireless personal area networks, part III discusses how the WiMAX is used as a current standard for Wireless data transmission tec- hnology, which is optimized to deliver high, bursty data rates to mobile subscribers, and to support real-time multimedia and Voice over IP (VoIP) applications, and part-TV explores how these emerging Wireless technologies differ from one another.","","978-0-7695-2846-5","978-0-7695-2846-5","10.1109/AUSWIRELESS.2007.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299663","Bluetooth;WiFi;WiMAX.","Bluetooth;Electronic learning;Explosives;Frequency;Internet;Metropolitan area networks;Mobile computing;WiMAX;Wireless LAN;Wireless personal area networks","Bluetooth;Internet telephony;broadband networks;mobile computing;multimedia systems;wireless LAN","Bluetooth;Internet;Voice over IP;WiFi;WiMAX;broadband wireless technologies;e-Learning;mobile computing;multimedia application;ubiquitous computing;wireless data transmission;wireless local area networks;wireless metropolitan area networks;wireless personal area networks","","19","","11","","","27-30 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect the intruding objects, images taken by the cameras are compared with a maintained background image using PISC method. Then the contour of the object region on an image is traced and transformed to the coordinate of sensitive plane. The contours are collected to a single PC and existence of a common region is judged.

It realizes pipeline operations by adjusting delay times. Implementation of fine-tuning of wave-pipelines is possible to further increase the throughput. However, in the FPGA, it is not able to be executed by the restriction on the structure. This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for the FPGA developed by the register-transfer level (RTL) design. Although the RTL design of the FPGA has various advantages, it is required for a high-speed design for a routing delay which is larger than that of a conventional FPGA.

Traditionally, the payload inspection based traffic identification methodologies have been studied and developed for static internet traffic generated by well-known network applications such as http, ftp, telnet, smtp, etc. However, this approach is inadequate any more to detect and control newly emerging applications using P2P-like or P2P-based communication protocol. Also it strongly depends on the central intrusion detection system or firewall because signature as the prior-knowledge is normally built on that kind of systems. That fact derives three issues: performance overhead, central point of failure, and abnormality handling of traffic.

"Data forensic techniques using Benford's law and Zipf's law for keystroke dynamics","Iorliam, A.; Ho, A.T.S.; Poh, N.; Tirunagari, S.; Bours, P.","Dept. of Comput., Univ. of Surrey, Guildford, UK","Biometrics and Forensics (IWBF), 2015 International Workshop on","20150521","2015","","","1","6","The selection and application of biometrics traits for authentication and identification have recently attracted a significant amount of research interest. In this paper we investigate the use of keystroke data to distinguish between humans using keystroke biometric systems and non-humans for auditing application. Recently, Benford's Law and Zipf's Law, which are both discrete Power law probability distributions, have been effectively used to detect fraud and discriminate between genuine data and fake/tampered data. As such, our motivation is to apply the Benford's Law and Zipf's Law on keystroke data and to determine whether they follow these laws and discriminate between humans using keystroke biometric systems from non-humans. From the results, we observe that, the latency values of the keystroke data from humans actually follow the Benford's law and Zipf's law, but not the duration values. This implies that, latency values from humans would follow the two laws, whereas the latency values from non-humans would deviate from the Benford's law and Zipf's law. Even though, the duration values from humans deviates from the Benford's law, they do follow a pattern that we can develop an accurate model for the duration values. We perform experiments using the benchmark data set developed by Killourhy and Maxion, CMU [1] and obtain divergences of 0.0008, 0.029 and 0.05 for the keyup-keydown (latency), keydown-keydown, and duration of the keystroke data, respectively. Moreover, P-value's of 0.7770, 0.6230 and 0.0160 are obtained for the keyup-keydown (latency), keydown-keydown, and duration of the keystroke data, respectively. We observe that the latency (which is the time elapsed between release of the first key and pressing down of the next key) is one of the most important features used by administrators for auditing purposes to detect anomalies during their employees logging into their company system.","","","","10.1109/IWBF.2015.7110238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110238","Benford???s law;Keystroke Dynamics;Zipf???s law","Companies;Data models;Databases;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Polynomials;Standards","biometrics (access control);digital forensics;fraud;statistical distributions","Benford's law;Zipf's law;anomaly detection;auditing application;biometrics traits;data forensic techniques;discrete power law probability distributions;fraud detection;keydown-keydown;keystroke biometric systems;keystroke dynamics;keyup-keydown","","0","","26","","","3-4 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing","ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm","","3","","27","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Understanding the latest DDoS attacks can provide new insights for effective defense. But most of existing understandings are based on indirect traffic measures (e.g., backscatters) or traffic seen locally. In this study, we present an in-depth analysis based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks directly observed in a seven-month period. These attacks were launched by 674 botnets from 23 different botnet families with a total of 9,026 victim IPs belonging to 1,074 organizations in 186 countries. Our analysis reveals several interesting findings about today's Internet DDoS attacks. Some highlights include: (1) geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction of future attacks for most active botnet families, (2) from the target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet families, (3) there is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or in turn. These findings add to the existing literature on the understanding of today's Internet DDoS attacks, and offer new insights for designing new defense schemes at different levels.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266866","","Cities and towns;Computer crime;Geology;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Organizations","IP networks;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Internet DDoS attacks;Internet distributed denial-of-service;botnet families;geolocation analysis;geospatial distribution;indirect traffic measures;interattack time interval;source prediction;start time prediction;victim IP","","","","","","","22-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system.

ICPADS '08. 14th IEEE International Conference on","20081222","2008","","","485","492","A major concern for network intrusion detection systems is the ability of an intruder to evade the detection by routing through a chain of the intermediate hosts to attack a target machine and maintain the anonymity. Such an intermediate host is called a stepping-stone. The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets. A number of algorithms have been proposed to detect stepping-stones, but some of them failed to detect correctly when the network traffic is somehow corrupted or with the chaff packets. We discuss the viability of solving those issues by improving a previous methodology.

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.","1060-9857","978-1-4577-1349-1","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076761","card data flow;compliance;payment system;private cloud;virtual machine","Credit cards;Decision support systems;Kernel;Security;Sockets;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","PCI DSS compliance;card transaction processing;credit card data flow automated discovery;credit card process;intrusive instrumentation;middleware;payment card industry;payment infrastructure;personal financial transactions;private cloud environments;security compliance;source code application;virtual machine introspection technology;virtual machines;virtualized servers","","3","","29","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performance evaluation is performed in terms of the detection probability, false alarm rate, detection delay and the robustness of the algorithms to different detection threshold values. The algorithms are applied locally to measurements collected from three locations of an experimental network and under two attack intensities. The results show that the cumulative sum algorithms are more robust and achieve higher performance under both attack intensities. Next, we use the Dempster-Shafer algorithm to fuse the outputs provided by the above locally executed algorithms at different nodes, thus forming a collaborative intrusion detection system.

While most of the wired network cabling is located inside buildings, already secured from the use of un-authorized physical access through the use of keys, badge access and so forth. In contrast, wireless APs may be accessed from the premises or even slightly away from premises where they are deployed, if the signal is detectable (for instance, from parking lots or nearby buildings). Thus wireless networks require a very secure access to APs and the ability to isolate and terminate any potential threat to the network.

However P2P systems can be potential vehicle for active worms which can spread in all manager peers in a short time. This issue has not been studied in the literature. In this paper we address effects of active worm propagation in a P2P network management system in which nodes are structured in several hierarchal levels. We intend to evaluate the speed of propagation in the system. To aim at this goal, we perform extensive simulation study and investigate the parameters influencing the speed of propagation such as the number of vulnerable host managers, degree of connections between peer managers inside the groups, the number of connections between different groups of managers in the hierarchical structure. We further compare worm propagation in different levels of hierarchy by different types of active worm attack strategies. We show that in addition to P2P parameters hierarchical structure affect the speed of active worm propagation. This issue suggests that P2P network management systems are more vulnerable in comparison to classical NMSs when they face to security attacks. Therefore to realize implementation of P2P NMSs security concerns should be taken into account.","","978-1-4244-4423-6","978-0-7695-3696-5","10.1109/CTRQ.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5176069","Active Worm Attacks;Network Management Systems;P2P systems","Conference management;Equations;Information security;Peer to peer computing;Power system management;Quality management;Reliability theory;Technology management;Tin;Topology","computer network management;computer viruses;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security","P2P system;active worm attack strategies;active worm propagation;hierarchal level structure;hierarchical peer-to-peer network management system","","0","1","9","","","20-25 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The difficulty to define the filtering rules comes from the hardness to identify normal and anomaly packets from the incoming packets. The purpose of our research is to explore the early detective method for anomaly accesses based on statistic analysis. In this paper, we firstly define the entropy-based analysis, then analyze the amount of incoming packets to our collage. As the results, we were able to extract the following features for the entropy analysis. Firstly, fluctuations for first octet aggregation lead to similar pattern compared to that of first and second octets aggregation. Secondly, sliding time of 10 minutes of entropy window was sensitive to detect anomaly accesses. Finally, differential entropy detected the small amount of 80/TCP anomaly accesses while analysis of frequency was hard to find that.","","978-0-7695-3109-0","","10.1109/CISIS.2008.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606674","Anomaly access;DoS attacks;Entropy;Statistics","Competitive intelligence;Computer crime;Educational institutions;Entropy;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Software systems;Statistical analysis;Web server","entropy;security of data;statistical analysis","anomaly accessed IP packets;denial of service;entropy;intrusion detection system;statistic analysis","","3","","9","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The high-level technical challenges associated with microgrids include (1) operation modes and transitions that comply with IEEE1547 and (2) control architecture and communication. In Part I, the emphasis is on the design of an electrical control architecture for an offshore oil drilling platform powered by wind generation. Engineering a distributed control system having safety critical features, requiring real-time performance is challenging. In this follow-up article we introduce the communication framework for the microgrid scenario under investigation. In all communication networks, scholastic delays and performance are inherent. The only feasible approach is to put bounds on the random processes, qualitatively define the worst cases, and build the distributed control system to be resilient enough to tolerate those behaviors. This is the approach taken by this paper. We propose a communication architecture, discuss performances requirements of the sub-systems, and layout network solutions meeting those specifications.","","","","10.1109/TDC.2014.6863567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863567","Communication Network Performance and Availability;DC Microgrids;Distributed Control Architecture;Security","","","","","2","","15","","","14-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each network element may have its own set of security capabilities, but not all security capabilities on all network elements are necessary at the same time for a given network configuration. An end-to-end network view is necessary to choose appropriate security capabilities while minimizing network overhead. For VoIP, using an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core network and wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi<sup>∗</sup>) access, the service provider can offer the feature functionality of the core network to both enterprise and residential customers simultaneously. However, both market segments provide their own set of unique security challenges, and what is appropriate for one market segment is not necessarily appropriate for the other. This paper explores various security implications for both of these market segments and proposes options for securing each network configuration.

Contracts can provide a useful mechanism for identifying and tracking vulnerabilities. Currently, contracts have been proposed for reliability and formal verification; yet, their use in security is limited. Static analysis methods are able to identify many known vulnerabilities; however, they suffer from a high rate of false-positives. The creation of a mechanism that can verify identified vulnerabilities is therefore warranted. We propose a contract-based security assertion monitoring framework (CB SAMF) for reducing the number of security vulnerabilities that are exploitable. CB SAMF will span multiple software layers and be used in an enhanced systems development life cycle (SDLC) including service-oriented analysis and design (SOAD).","","978-0-7695-3473-2","978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780849","contracts;monitors;security engineering;service-oriented architecture","Computer displays;Computer security;Contracts;Intrusion detection;Logic;Monitoring;Real time systems;Runtime;Service oriented architecture;Software architecture","formal verification;program diagnostics;real-time systems;security of data;software architecture;software reliability;supervisory programs","contract-based security assertion monitoring framework;contract-based security monitors;formal verification;real-time systems;reliability;security vulnerability;service oriented software architecture;service-oriented analysis and design;software layers;static analysis methods;systems development life cycle","","0","","16","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An analytical model is employed to examine smart battery characteristics to support the theoretical intrusion detection limits and capabilities of B-SIPS. Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters. These optimum static polling rates introduce minimum and maximum thresholds for the various scenarios mobile devices encounter on a daily basis. Future work will investigate dynamic solutions to optimize battery lifetime under a range of circumstances by encompassing the data results found in this study.","","1-4244-1028-2","1-4244-1029-0","10.1109/SECON.2007.342999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147529","","Availability;Battery management systems;Energy management;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Portable computers;Power system management;Power system modeling;Protection;Sleep","security of data","attack execution times;battery-based attack detections;battery-sensing intrusion protection systems;illicit network attack densities;intrusion detection limits;lifetime optimization;malicious network activity;mobile computers;polling rates;small wireless devices;smart battery;system management bus speeds","","2","1","14","","","22-25 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Process algebras (PA) as Â¿-Calculus allow a high-level description of interactions among processes. Because the most important characteristic of self-organization is the restriction of interactions to neighboring elements (localized interactions), we extend the Â¿-Calculus with the locality awareness, a necessary abstraction to allow the modeling of self-organization in WSNs. To get full locality awareness in Â¿-Calculus we extended it with concepts for modeling spatiality, probability and time. Moreover, new types of channels are included in the Â¿-Calculus to include the different types of communication existing in a WSN: distribution, broadcast and aggregation. In order to validate our new PA, we successfully model a self-organizing clustering algorithm for WSNs.","","978-1-4244-3942-3","978-1-4244-3941-6","10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345551","Process algebra;ad hoc network;clustering;emergence;locality aware;pi-calculus;self-organization;wireless sensor network","Algebra;Broadcasting;Calculus;Clustering algorithms;Distributed control;Embedded system;Informatics;Probability;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","pi calculus;protocols;wireless sensor networks","process algebra;self-organizing behavior;self-organizing protocols;wireless sensor networks;Â¿-calculus","","0","","13","","","12-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
