International Symposium on","20070402","2006","","","847","850","In this paper, an application-based intrusion detection and prevention (ID/IP) system coupled with data mining and mobile agent technologies is introduced. Under this approach, the ID/IP system consists of a core engine with data sensor, detector, configuration device and alert and response device as its main components. The data sensors posting as designated agents are to gather information from their respective sources in real time. The information gathered by the respective agent is fed into the detector where correlation methods and data mining techniques are employed to analyze and identify any intrusive activity or event. Since information is gathered from various sources by the respective agent, different type of profiles representing normal behavior such as network traffic, users, systems, applications, transactions, alarms and alerts can be built, and deviation from these profiles are considered to be intrusion. A rating model is then used to evaluate the intrusive activities. When an intrusion or attack is detected by the detector and evaluated to have a rating below the threshold value, the configuration device changes the status of the ID/IP system to alert mode and signal the alert and response device to take the necessary actions. Subsequently, mobile response agents are used to carry out response mechanisms at the target and the source","","0-7803-9741-X","0-7803-9741-X","10.1109/ISCIT.2006.339856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141335","","Correlation;Data mining;Detectors;Engines;Event detection;Information analysis;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Sensor systems","competitive intelligence;data mining;mobile agents;security of data","alert device;application-based intrusion detection;business intelligence applications;configuration device;correlation methods;data mining;data sensor;mobile agent technologies;prevention system;response device","","1","","16","","","Oct. 18 2006-Sept. 20 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IDS monitors' network or host system activities by collecting network information, and analyze this information for malicious activities. Cloud computing, with the concept of Software as a Service (SaaS) presents an exciting benefit when it enables providers to rent their services to users in perform complex tasks over the Internet. In addition, Cloud based services reduce a cost in investing new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on Cloud computing called Cloud-based Intrusion Detection Service (CBIDS). This model enables the identification of malicious activities from different points of network and overcome the deficiency of classical intrusion detection.

In this light, this research work explored the possibility of employing multiple classifiers approach, but limited to variations of Bayesian technique, namely NaiÂ¿ve Bayes Classifier, Bayesian Networks, and Expert-elicited Bayesian Network. Empirical evaluations were conducted based on a standard network intrusion dataset and the results showed that the multiple Bayesian classifiers approach gave insignificant increase of performance in detecting network intrusions as compared to a single Bayesian classifier. Naives Bayes Classifier should be considered in detecting network intrusions due to its comparable performance with multiple Bayesian classifiers approach.

At this circumstance, when anyone rings your door bell, naturally you won't mind that, whoever the guest may be. At another instance, if you are tired of attending unwelcomed guests n times, chances are there to neglect the guest at the n+1<sup>th</sup> time more consciously. If the guest at the door is an opportunity, it would be evidently missed. Our innovation to conquer this problem is, the video of the person standing at the door is made appeared at the television screen not by replacing the existing cable signal but as a pop up screen which covers a small portion of the TV screen. So, by noticing the pop up, one can decide which is vital either the TV program or the guest.

Cloud computing has opened up a new frontier of challenges by introducing a different type of trust scenario. Today, the problem of trusting cloud computing is a paramount concern for most enterprises. It's not that the enterprises don't trust the cloud providers' intentions rather, they question cloud computing's capabilities regarding the security. To trust on the cloud, the cloud computing should have the appropriate technologies to tackle the accompanying challenges of trust. In this paper we proposed an algorithm which can increase the trust of the client on the cloud service provider. Different researchers have proposed different algorithms like data encryption and data decryption using private or public key concepts. But trust to cloud is basically based on cloud trust policies, which is not enough for the client to use cloud for the sensitive data. In this paper the proposed algorithm uses a function called key_function and the key which increases the trust to cloud during transmission. The cloud can ensure that the cloud server is providing necessary security for the user's data during transmission. By matching the key which is updated by the key_function, the user can be secured that the data accessed from the cloud server is secured.","","978-1-4799-3447-8","","10.1109/ICoAC.2013.6922015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6922015","SAAS;decryption;encryption;key;trust","Availability;Irrigation","cloud computing;cryptography;trusted computing","cloud computing;cloud service provider;cloud trust policy;computing services;data decryption;data encryption;key_function;private key concept;public key concept;trust scenario;user trust","","0","","26","","","18-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such algorithms assign tasks to nodes by sequentially selecting the best nodes as leaders. Since the correct functionality of such algorithms depends on the truthfulness of participant nodes, any misbehavior can disrupt the operation of the network due to absence of a centralized monitoring unit. In this paper, we consider the problem of malicious behavior in leader-based MANETs. Current solution analyzes the behavior of the leader by means of some checker nodes. This approach is vulnerable since a malicious checker can ruin the character of a normal behaving leader, and declare it as a malicious one. We propose an efficient self-organizing mechanism which can detect a malicious behaving leader, while protecting a normal behaving leader from being declared as a malicious node. In addition, our mechanism is designed with no constraints on leader selection algorithm, which makes it applicable to any kind of leader-based network. We also provide several simulation results, showing that our proposed mechanism is efficient and effective even for large MANETs.","2156-9711","","","10.1109/WD.2013.6686475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686475","Leader-Based MANETs;Malicious Behavior;Malicious Detection;Self-Organizing Algorithms","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Lead;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Performance evaluation","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","MANET;centralized monitoring unit;checker nodes;leader-based mobile ad-hoc networks;malicious behaving leader;malicious checker;malicious detection;normal behaving leader;participant nodes;task-based self-organizing algorithms","","0","","7","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It uses improved reverse sequential hypothesis testing (RSHT) to detect portscans which are routinely used to find vulnerable hosts to compromise. Then a CPU emulator is used to execute every possible instruction sequence in suspicious traffic and determine whether it is an exploit code.

Unfortunately, security issues have not been treated properly in CAN, although CAN control messages could be life-critical. With the appearance of the connected car environment, in-vehicle networks (e.g., CAN) are now connected to external networks (e.g., 3G/4G mobile networks), enabling an adversary to perform a long-range wireless attack using CAN vulnerabilities. In this paper we show that a long-range wireless attack is physically possible using a real vehicle and malicious smartphone application in a connected car environment. We also propose a security protocol for CAN as a countermeasure designed in accordance with current CAN specifications.

IEEE","20030415","2002","6","","6-2685","6-2695 vol.6","While attacks against an enterprise's Internet connection receive the most attention, attacks against an enterprise through the voice network remain common. Attackers can bypass Internet-related defenses through access to unauthorized and poorly secured modems. The Internet itself, and an enterprise's Internet security policies and procedures, has made this issue worse by forcing ""addicted"" users to access the Internet through their Internet Service Provider (ISP). A typical enterprise, even one with modem usage policies and procedures, will have some number of unauthorized and/or poorly secured modems. Traditional techniques do not address this issue. Scanning and modem protection technologies assist in enforcement, but do not solve the problem. The ideal solution lies in applying concepts from the IP security network to the voice network. By deploying in-line security devices on all voice network trunk circuits, applications such as firewalls, integrated scanning, authentication, virtual private networks (VPNs), and intrusion detection can be applied. This approach provides the same level of protection and a familiar paradigm on the voice network, as is present on the IP network. In addition, because the voice network is billed based on usage, rather than bandwidth, this security device can support applications that provide a significant return on investment (ROI).","","0-7803-7231-X","","10.1109/AERO.2002.1036110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1036110","","Authentication;Bandwidth;IP networks;Integrated circuit technology;Intrusion detection;Modems;Protection;Security;Virtual private networks;Web and internet services","Internet;authorisation;computer networks;modems;telecommunication security;telephone networks;virtual private networks;voice communication","IP security network concepts;ISP;Internet Service Provider;Internet security policies;Internet-related defenses;VPN;authentication;enterprise Internet connection attacks;firewalls;in-line security devices;integrated scanning;intrusion detection;modem protection technologies;modem usage policies;modem usage procedures;poorly secured modems;return on investment;security device;technical solutions;unauthorized modems;virtual private networks;voice network attacks;voice network billing;voice network protection;voice network trunk circuits;voice security threats","","3","","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to model normal behaviors accurately and improve the performance of intrusion detection, a joint evolutionary neural network (JENN) is presented in this paper. Input features, network structure and connection weights are evolved jointly using genetic algorithm. To evolve all three tasks jointly, a hybrid representation scheme is employed, and penalty factors for the number of input nodes and hidden nodes are introduced into fitness function.

Actually, managing MANETspsila security is a hard challenge due to the inherent complexity and the tremendous number of parameters which should be considered. To provide efficient security management, we focus on three main parameters: the secured device capabilities, the associated network security and the secured applications. The solution we propose, named Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a scalable, flexible and application-oriented framework able to manage security depending on the application requirements and the network security conditions. ASMA is based on a structure called macrograph combining both dynamic trust management and multipath routing. The macrograph structure is capable to estimate transmission security in order to assure that communications are established only when they match applications security requirements. ASMA flexibility offers compliance with most on-demand routing protocols and security tools. In this paper we present simulation results for ASMA associated with AOMDV (a multipath declination of AODV) routing protocol and compare results with AOMDV.

However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol. We perform simulations in ns-2 to demonstrate that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged while listening energy saving of 30 to 129 times is achieved, depending on the network load.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273007","Sensor networks;local monitoring;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna.","Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Delay;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensor systems and applications;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","sensor networks;sleep-wake aware local monitoring;telecommunication traffic","","6","","30","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their security remains problematic as many attacks are discovered against them. Smart meters are embedded devices that are constrained in terms of computing power and memory. They are also deployed on a large scale which imposes specific requirements (e.g., no false positives) on any IDS developed for them. In this paper, we propose a model-based technique for building intrusion detection systems (IDS) for smart meters, that takes these constraints into account. We implement our IDS on an open source smart meter platform. We show that our IDS imposes little performance overhead, even under severe memory constraints, and effectively detects a wide range of both known and unknown attacks.

Creation of an IDS to detect anomaly intrusions, in a timely and accurate manner, has been an elusive goal for researchers. This paper describes a host-based IDS model, utilizing a Radial Basis Function neural network. It functions as a combined anomaly/misuse detector that helps to overcome most of the limitations in existing models. Rather than creating user profiles or behavioral characteristics, we trained our network using session data in the identification and tested experimentally on different attack/normal sessions.

Malicious behavior may target the disruption of communications, infrastructure services, and applications. A number of ID techniques proposed for dynamic wireless networks (e.g., sensor, ad-hoc and mobile ad-hoc networks) are based on the creation of an overlay hierarchy or other structure to organize the collection and processing of ID data. The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency. Specifically, we introduce analytical expressions that map ID structures to the metric space of real numbers. We define this mapping for a) various types of tree structures that have been proposed previously for dynamic wireless systems and b) a hypercube structure that presents promising resiliency characteristics.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

An extension of B-SIPS, the Multi-Vector Portable Intrusion Detection System (MVP-IDS) validates the idea of recognizing attacks based on anomalous IC drain by correlating the detected anomalies with wireless attack traffic from both the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth mediums. To effectively monitor the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth mediums for malicious packet streams, the Snort-Based Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Attack Detection and Signature System (BADSS) modules were introduced. This paper illustrates how a blended strategy of using a low overhead tripwire can be combined with more sophisticated detection mechanisms to provide an effective protection system for limited resource wireless information technology devices.","","978-1-4244-7091-4","","10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5612449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5612449","","Batteries;Bluetooth;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Servers;Wireless communication","Bluetooth;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","B-SIPS;Bluetooth attack detection;MVP-IDS;Snort-Based Wi-Fi;anomalous IC drain;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;instantaneous current drain;malicious packet stream;multvector portable intrusion detection system;portable information device;signature system;wireless attack traffic","","0","","6","","","Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, a high-performance signature matching scheme is of great importance for a signature-based IDS. In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort.

Apart from the advantages the cloud offers, it can also bring in some potential security threats to the organization by not having organization specific firewalls, monitoring mechanisms and physical security. This limits the chances that companies move onto the cloud, which could have otherwise become an extremely attractive alternative for the businesses. The need is to make cloud services more reliable and trustworthy for the businesses by providing a proper security mechanism that addresses the existing drawbacks in cloud computing. The key is a firewall model that constitutes a centralized Cloud Firewall Management Server and Firewall Clients that communicate with the Cloud Firewall Management Server. This enables the organizations to maintain their own control over the firewall and firewall policies.

Serving degraded content reduces strain on resources and enables them to cater for a larger set of clients. To that end, this paper studies adversarial exploits of dynamic content adaptation mechanisms to a new instantiation of reduction of quality (RoQ) attacks. The RoQ attack pattern is orchestrated to cause different forms of damage such as longer response time for legitimate clients, degraded content being served and underutilization of resources. We assess the impact of RoQ attacks via the potency metric which reflects the tradeoffs between the damage inflicted and the cost in mounting the attack.

The technique is implemented in a feedforward neural network that uses a Gaussian radial basis function as the model generator. An evaluation based on the inclusiveness and exclusiveness of samples with respect to specific criteria is applied to accretively learn the output clusters of the neural network.

Sophisticated attackers can, however, employ a number of obfuscation techniques to confuse the alert correlation engine or classifier. Recognizing the need for a systematic analysis of the impact of attack obfuscation, this paper models attack strategies as general finite order Markov models, and treats obfuscated observations as noises. Taking into account that only finite observation window and limited computational time can be afforded, this work develops an algorithm to efficiently inference on the joint distribution of clean and obfuscated attack sequences. The inference algorithm recovers the optimal match of obfuscated sequences to attack models, and enables a systematic and quantitative analysis on the impact of obfuscation on attack classification.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903567","","Computational modeling;Dynamic programming;Hidden Markov models;Inference algorithms;Markov processes;Probabilistic logic;Vectors","Markov processes;computer network security;invasive software","Markov models;attack obfuscation;diverse network attack strategies;finite observation window;limited computational time;obfuscated attack sequences;obfuscated network attack sequences;observed malicious events;probabilistic inference;sophisticated attackers;systematic analysis","","0","","27","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.","","978-1-4799-2353-3","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795","IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network","","0","","14","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Denial of service (DoS) attacks cause significant disruptions to the Internet, compounding the delay jitter and loss of packets that are used to transmit sensor measurements and control signals. Existing works have mainly focused on controller design under network normal operation, which might be inadequate to the threats of DoS attacks. In this paper, the authors present two mitigation measures from the viewpoint of network intrusion detection and response. The basic idea is that the routers close to the attack sources actively drop the attack traffic or lower-priority traffic to protect the resource for the legitimate application traffic. The simulation results indicate that the proposed defense measures are effective for ameliorating the NBCS performance degradation. We suggest that a plausible direction for the security of NBCS may combine the proposed network defense measures with specific controller design to compensate for delay jitter/packet loss.","","0-7803-8730-9","","10.1109/IECON.2004.1432165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432165","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;Jitter;Loss measurement;Niobium compounds;Stochastic systems;Traffic control;Web and internet services","Internet;authorisation;control system synthesis;delays;jitter;microcontrollers;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;control signal transmission;delay jitter;denial of service attack;mitigating performance;network defense;network intrusion detection;network router;network traffic;network-based control system security;sensor measurement;stochastic delay","","1","","11","","","2-6 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These approaches are complicated, costly, and present their own vulnerabilities. In this paper, we describe new secure software technology that enables users to transparently add memory encryption to their existing software, without requiring users to invest in costly encryption hardware or requiring programmers to undertake complicated software redesign/redeployment. The memory encryption and transparent aegis library (METAL) functions as a shim library, allowing legacy applications to transparently enjoy an assurance of memory confidentiality and integrity.

Facing new application scenarios in cloud computing, the IDS approaches yield several problems since the operator of the IDS should be the user, not the administrator of the cloud infrastructure. Extensibility, efficient management, and compatibility to virtualization-based context need to be introduced into many existing IDS implementations.Additionally, the cloud providers need to enable possibilities to deploy and configure IDS for the user. Within this paper, we summarize several requirements for deploying IDS in the cloud and propose an extensible IDS architecture for being easily used in a distributed cloud infrastructure.","","978-0-7695-3929-4","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380611","Cloud Computing;IDS;IDS Management;Virtual Machine;Virtualization","Application software;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Robustness;Virtual machining","Internet;security of data","IDS management;cloud computing;cloud providers;distributed IDS solutions;distributed cloud infrastructure;distributed environment;intrusion detection system;network communication;virtualization-based context compatibility","","26","1","24","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Higher performance may result if the insignificant and/or useless features can be eliminated. Discriminant analysis can identify the significance of the examined features. In this paper discriminant analysis and support vector machine are combined to detect network intrusion. Empirical results indicate that using the important feature set extracted from the discriminant analysis can get nearly the same performance as the full feature set.

A flow of packets is decided by the header fields of incoming packets. Software solutions for packet classification are not suitable for wire-speed processing and are not secure. For wirespeed and secure network access, hardware solutions for packet classification are mandatory which can also sustain high throughput at low latency. Memory required for hardware architecture is also a crucial problem. In this paper, we have performed classification of packets using basic XNOR gate. We compare our proposed design with StrideBV which is one of efficient decomposition based technique for packet classification. The results obtained by synthesis and stimulation using XilinxISE Design tool 13.1 are presented in this paper. From the results, we have concluded that our proposed technique is memory efficient as well as has low latency than StrideBV.","","","","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164761","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164761","5-tuple;Packet classification;latency;quality of services;throughput","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Memory management;Throughput","Internet;firewalls;logic gates;quality of service;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing","Internet router;XNOR gate;XilinxISE design tool 13.1;firewall;high performance architecture;incoming packet header fields;network security;packet classification;packet flow;quality of services;secure network access;wire-speed processing","","0","","11","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data mining and machine learning technology has been extensively applied in network intrusion detection and prevention systems by discovering user behavior patterns from the network traffic data. Association rules and sequence rules are the main technique of data mining for intrusion detection. Considering the classical Apriori algorithm with bottleneck of frequent itemsets mining, we propose a Length-Decreasing Support to detect intrusion based on data mining, which is an improved Apriori algorithm.

We include simulation results to illustrate the behavior of a network when using this strategy under both single-source and distributed DoS attacks, and to show its effectiveness in detecting ""potential"" attacks at an early stage, identifying attacking flows, and reducing the damage caused by such attacks.

The efficiency of an Intrusion Detection System in the case of an ad hoc network is not only determined by its dynamicity in monitoring but also by its flexibility in utilizing the available power in each of its nodes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system, based on a power level metric for potential ad hoc hosts, which is used to determine the duration for which a particular node can support a network-monitoring node. Power - aware Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (PHIDS) focuses on the available power level in each of the nodes and determines the network monitors. Power aware intrusion detection using hybrid agents result in maintaining power and provides an iterative poweroptimal solution to identify fewer nodes for distributed agent-based intrusion detection.","","0-7695-2699-3","","10.1109/ICSNC.2006.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041517","","Ad hoc networks;Availability;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Power engineering and energy;Wireless sensor networks","","","","1","","14","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We evaluate our combined method, referred to as Blacklisting Recommendation System (or BRS), on one month of logs from Dshield, and we demonstrate that it improves significantly the prediction rate over state-of-the-art methods as well as the robustness against poisoning attacks.

In both the attacks, an attacker sends the false reply to source node that it is having the shortest route to the destination. In black hole attack, attackers drops all the packets received from source node and in gray hole attack, attacker drops packets selectively or forwards packets selectively or forwarding packets but not data packets.

Since vulnerability cannot be totally removed from a workflow management system, successful attacks always happen and may inject malicious tasks or incorrect data into the workflow system. Referring to the incorrect data further corrupt more data objects in the system, which comprises the integrity level of the system. This problem cannot be efficiently solved by existing defense mechanisms, such as access control, intrusion detection, and checkpoints. In this paper, we propose a practical solution for online attack recovery of workflows. The recovery system discovers all damages caused by the malicious tasks that the intrusion detection system reports and automatically repairs the damages based on data and control dependencies among workflow tasks. We analyze the behaviors of our attack recovery system based on the continuous time Markov chain model. The analytical results demonstrate that our system is practical when the parameters of the system are reasonably designed.","1063-6927","0-7695-2086-3","","10.1109/ICDCS.2004.1281607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281607","","Access control;Automatic control;Computer crashes;Control systems;Credit cards;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Scheduling;Transaction databases;Workflow management software","Internet;Markov processes;authorisation;business data processing;system recovery;workflow management software","access control;checkpoints;continuous time Markov chain model;intrusion detection;online attack recovery;self-healing workflow systems;workflow management system","","8","","10","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
