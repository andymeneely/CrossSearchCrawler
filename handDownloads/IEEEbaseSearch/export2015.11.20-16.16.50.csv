GenProg uses an extended form of genetic programming to evolve a program variant that retains required functionality but is not susceptible to a given defect, using existing test suites to encode both the defect and required functionality. Structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging reduce the difference between this variant and the original program to a minimal repair. We describe the algorithm and report experimental results of its success on 16 programs totaling 1.25 M lines of C code and 120K lines of module code, spanning eight classes of defects, in 357 seconds, on average. We analyze the generated repairs qualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate that the process efficiently produces evolved programs that repair the defect, are not fragile input memorizations, and do not lead to serious degradation in functionality.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2011.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035728","Automatic programming;corrections;testing and debugging.","Automatic programming;Computer bugs;Debugging;Encoding;Maintenance engineering;Syntactics","formal specification;genetic algorithms;software maintenance","GenProg;automatic software repair;defects repair;formal specifications;genetic programming;legacy programs;program annotations;special coding practices","","31","","75","","2011-10-06","Jan.-Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

EHMA is a faster searching algorithm that reduces the searching time significantly. In the original paper [1], EHMA is implemented in two tiers, but this paper considers the implementation of EHMA in three tiers.

To provide this desired service guarantee to high priority flows, we build dynamic network flow model, propose multi-layered network flow-rate constrain algorithms and define a series of malicious-based packet discarding policies. The system is shown to be highly flexible and robust against different types of attack patterns, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework.

Many methods were proposed to prevent those attacks. Some of them were created to learn about pattern and behavior of the attacker. That is honeypot. Honeypot is classified into two types based on the simulation that honeypot can do : low interaction and high interaction. In this paper, we propose a low-interaction honeypot for emulating vulnerabilities that can be exploited using XSS and SQL injection attacks. But this honeypot not only records attacker's request, but also try to expose attacker identity by using some browser exploitation techniques. Some attackers would use techniques to hide their identity, thus they couldn't be tracked. Our proposed honeypot was trying to overcome this problem by giving them malicious JavaScript codes. The malicious JavaScript codes will be run when an attacker open the honeypot's website. We have conducted several test to see how our honeypot's performance. Our honeypot could catch more useful information about the HTTP request than popular web-based honeypot, Glastopf.

This is emphasized by the fact that virtual machines are abruptly migrated between physical hosts, in the same or even in different data centers under different security policies. If security is not correctly enforced at the destination locations, and not properly updated in the source locations, security of the migrating virtual machine as well as the co-located machines can be compromised. In this paper, we intend to tackle this problem, specifically for intrusion detection/prevention and VPN/IPsec as main security mechanisms. More precisely, we propose a systematic verification approach to check the compliance of security configurations. To this end, we first elaborate on two properties, namely intrusion monitoring configuration preservation and VPN/IPsec protection configuration preservation. Then, we derive a set of formulas that compare security configurations before and after migration. This allows reasoning on whether the aforementioned security properties hold. To this end, we encode these formulas as constraint satisfaction problems. The obtained constraints are then submitted to a constraint solver, namely Sugar, in order to verify the properties and to pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903454","Cloud Computing;Intrusion Detection;Security;VPN/IPsec;Verification","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sugar;Virtual machining;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;computer centres;constraint satisfaction problems;security of data;virtual machines","VPN-IPsec protection configuration preservation;cloud computing;co-located machines;constraint satisfaction problems;data centers;intrusion monitoring configuration preservation;physical hosts;pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems;security configuration preservation;security mechanisms;security policies;security properties;systematic verification approach;virtual machines","","0","","26","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of the current security technologies do not provide early warnings about such attacks. This paper presents a Finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that uses an adaptive risk approach to predict multi-staged cloud attacks. The risk model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The attacks prediction model was integrated with our autonomous cloud intrusion detection framework (ACIDF) to raise early warnings about attacks to the controller so it can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments on DARPA 2000 dataset, the proposed prediction model has successfully fired the early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) initiative seeks to avoid such disasters and transform this area from a liability to a key asset in the fight to build and maintain secure systems. Coordinating international, community-based efforts from industry, government and academia, CVE strives to find and fix software product vulnerabilities more rapidly, predictably, and efficiently. The initiative seeks the adoption of a common naming practice for describing software vulnerabilities. Once adopted, these names will be included within security tools and services and on the fix sites of commercial and open source software package providers.

"A new ensemble-feature-selection framework for intrusion detection","Hai Thanh Nguyen; Franke, K.; Petrovic, S.","Norwegian Inf. Security Lab., Gjovik Univ. Coll., Gjovik, Norway","Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA), 2011 11th International Conference on","20120102","2011","","","213","218","Feature selection is an important part of a pattern recognition system. A feature selection method is required to be general enough to find representative features from training data, which are then used for classifying test patterns. The situation where the features selected from the training data are quite different from the representative features of the testing data is called over-selecting. The main causes of the over-selecting phenomenon are: non-comprehensive consideration of statistical properties of the training data, heuristic search strategies for feature selection and small sample size of the data set for training. In this paper, we show the influence of the over-selecting phenomenon on the over-fitting phenomenon of machine learning algorithms. We propose a new framework to address principal causes of over-selecting and thus reduce the chance of over-fitting. Our new framework that we call Ensemble Feature Selection measure (EnFS), allows to consider many statistical properties of a given data set at the same time by combining many feature selection methods used in the filter model. From the chosen feature selection measures, a new combined measure is constructed. We also propose a new search algorithm that ensures the globally optimal feature subsets by means of the constructed measure. The new search approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming (M01LP) problem by means of the branch-and-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear in the number of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our EnFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application. Experimental results obtained over the KDD CUP'99 benchmarking data set for IDS show that our EnFS measure is capable of reducing over-fitting by addressing over-selecting.","2164-7143","978-1-4577-1676-8","","10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121657","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0–1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0–1 fractional programming","Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Polynomials;Programming;Testing;Training;Training data","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;pattern recognition;security of data;set theory;tree searching","EnFS measure;branch-and- bound algorithm;ensemble feature selection measures;globally optimal feature subsets;heuristic search strategy;intrusion detection system;linear programming problem;machine learning algorithm;noncomprehensive consideration;over fitting phenomenon;pattern recognition system;representative feature;statistical property;test pattern classification","","0","","15","","","22-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, we are witnessing an increasing number of zero day attacks. Our analysis confirms that Local Area Networks are highly vulnerable to such attacks since there is free communication between the hosts in the LAN. A single compromised host can severely degrade the services in the traditional LAN and it is extremely difficult task for the security administrator to determine the compromised host that is generating attack traffic. In this paper we propose techniques to enhance the security in traditional LAN by making use of the trusted computing and virtualisation technologies. Often virtualisation is considered as a technology which enables to run multiple computers on a single server. We will show that virtualisation technology has significant benefits even if a single virtual machine is hosted on each VMM. Our model enables the security administrator to enforce security policies on the traffic that can be placed on the LAN medium. Hence our model efficiently deals with the attack at the VMM that is hosting the compromised virtual machine. The security can be enhanced furthermore by using the TPM technology to secure the virtualized local area networks. We will also present detail analysis of different cases scenarios on how the proposed model can enhance the security of the local area networks. There are several advantages with our model. Emerging attacks such as Conficker remain dormant in our proposed architecture in order to avoid detection. Hence our model can transform the highly vulnerable traditional LANs into trust enhanced and secure virtualized local area networks.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120871","Intrusion Detection;Local Area Networks;Trusted Computing;Virtual machine monitor;Zero Day Attacks","Hardware;Local area networks;Malware;Monitoring;Servers;Virtual machining","computer network security;local area networks;virtual machines","Conficker;TVLAN;VMM;detail analysis;security administrator;trusted and virtualised local area networks;trusted computing;virtual machine;virtualisation technology","","0","","21","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Internet situation awareness can be accomplished by creating a common basis for private and public operators to monitor their networks. Thus, an overlay monitoring layer is needed, which can be utilized to address a very important aspect for a more secure and trustworthy Internet. This is the need of various stakeholders to have the information they need to perform their decision tasks in a reliable fashion. This can be accomplished by offering them a common smart approach and the additional benefit of a global view, which they can use to compare their local situation with. This smart approach should utilize well proven existing global statistics, best practices and existing technical sensors, which can be adapted to the overall common framework. From this, output for all relevant stakeholders, like national assessments centers, can be generated to fulfill the individual needs. One possible input source could be the technical sensor technology, which has been developed by our Institute for Internet security and which we give to partners and other researchers free of charge. It is a great basis for an Internet situation awareness, since it is a well proven system, which has been in operation for a couple of years, and since it can easily be adapted by our developers to comply with the overall framework. The great advantages are in addition (i) that it is privacy compliant by design and (ii) can offer high performance with the (iii) capability for long time storage of the collected raw data.

Traditionally, feature-based one-class classifiers are the main components of anomaly detection systems. The performance of this anomaly detection system largely depends on the result of the feature selection. dissimilarity representations describe an object by its dissimilarities to a set of target class. The dissimilarity-based one-class classifiers (DBOCCs) are constructed on dissimilarity representations. Redundancy and relativity of the features cast little influence on the performance of DBOCCs. This paper proposes anomaly detection using DBOCCs with unsupervised learning approach. Several combinations of DBOCCs scheme have also been used. The experimental results on KDDCUP'99 dataset shows that DBOCCs can achieve high detection rate and low false positive without large degeneration in performance as traditional feature-based classifiers suffered when different feature subsets have been used.","","978-0-7695-3382-7","","10.1109/ISDA.2008.129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696299","","Application software;Classification algorithms;Computer networks;Constitution;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Unsupervised learning","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication traffic","anomaly detection systems;computer networks;dissimilarity representations;dissimilarity-based one-class classifiers;traffic deviation detection;unsupervised learning","","0","","24","","","26-28 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are some technologies available whereby the mail server scans and stops incoming mails containing potential viruses or Trojans; however, not all mall servers do so; as a result, devices get infected through one type of mail service in one network and in turn infect others in other networks. Within a short period, viruses multiply and spread rapidly across the networks, resulting into a digital epidemic. Because it is only a digital device that can function as a virus carrier, it must necessarily participate in the mechanism to prevent spread of viruses. To contain digital epidemics, we introduce a novel philosophy of artificial hygiene (AH) for digital devices. Hygiene is the art and science of prevention of propagation of disease. Using the AH philosophy, it is possible for an infected computer to automatically quarantine the infected email process from the network and ensure that a digital epidemic is contained.","","0-7803-8909-3","","10.1109/INDICO.2004.1497801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1497801","","Cities and towns;Computer viruses;Diseases;Electronic mail;Information technology;Invasive software;Operating systems;Safety;Telephony;Viruses (medical)","computer viruses;file servers;telecommunication security;unsolicited e-mail","AH;Trojan horse;artificial hygiene;digital epidemic;mail server;potential email virus","","0","","10","","","20-22 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper reviews ISP-level address sharing mechanisms, which allow Internet service providers to connect multiple customers who share a single IPv4 address.

We investigate the impact of live virtual-machine migration on state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) techniques (namely PCA and K-means), by evaluating live migration under various attack types and intensities.

An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated.

Consequently, there are growing rate of computer attacks despite the inclusion of network detectors on the networks. Therefore, this paper presents a model to investigate these problems.

Centralized access control determination fails to work in unstructured networks, as the information necessary for pre-configuration is not available. This situation is exacerbated by the dynamic nature of the environment's membership, so that the time and resources expended in off-line management are largely wasted. This paper presents a decentralized access control system that implements sociological trust constructs in a quantitative system to evaluate potential associates for collaborative interaction. A distributed, node-centric approach to trust management processes behavior grades into a reputation that nodes use to determine trustworthiness their peers before establishing associations. The application of a reputation against a dynamic risk assessment gives a measure of expectation of a peer's behavior, based on past performance and current the network environment.

The paper focuses on the design aspects of such an intrusion detection system by integrating different artificial intelligence techniques and a mobile agent architecture. Specifically, IBM's Aglets (TM) Software Development Kit (ASDK) is used as the base agent architecture, along with adaptive resonance theory (ART-2) neural networks for network pattern classification, and a fuzzy logic controller for decision/action resolution.

Among variety of anomaly detection approaches, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) are known to be two of the best machine learning algorithms to classify normal from abnormal behaviors. In this paper a hybrid anomaly-based intrusion detection method is proposed that is based on these two methods. These methods are trained in supervised way. We use the following additional techniques to improve the performance of proposed approach: First, a feature selection technique using the entropy of features is used for extracting optimized information from KDD data set and second, a novel method is proposed to combine the results of these two learning based methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed hybrid approach by using the KDD dataset. The simulation results show that which features of KDD are better to distinguish the normal from abnormal traffics.

But, like most things in life, the benefits come with risks. It's just a matter of knowing if the benefits outweigh the risks and vice versa. Unfortunately, the cloud computing does not escape to this universal rule. Then, it is important to consider the security of the cloud. As a solution to protect the cloud from security issues [1, 2, 3, 4], we think that IDSs integrated in the cloud remains among the best solution. We will also present an architecture based IDS that respects multi-tenancy architecture. The objective behind integrating multi-tenancy aspect in our solution is to give tenants the ability to configure some parts of the application, such as the color of the user interface or business rules, but they can't customize the application's code. This means that although tenants an using the same building blocks in their configuration, the appearance or workflow of the application may be different for two tenants. Also, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of each tenant can differ. In fact, we contend that multi-tenancy is a requirement for any cloud architecture because of four key benefits. First, High security: there are 3 key components that define the degree of isolation between multiple tenants in a data center: access policies, application deployment and data access and protection. Second, Economy: software development and maintenance costs are shared between the tenants. Third, Service assurance and faster updates: with multi-tenancy, the provider has to make updates once. In contrast with single-tenancy, an architecture in which each customer has their own software instance and may be given access to application code. Fourth, Efficiency and flexibility: A SaaS provider can run one instance of its application on one instance of a database and provide web access to multipl- customers. Each tenant's data is Isolated and remains invisible to other tenants [11].","","978-1-4799-0322-1","","10.1109/JNS3.2013.6595469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595469","cloud computing;cloud security;computer attacks;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;multi-tenancy;network attacks","Architecture;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Image color analysis;Reliability;Security","cloud computing;security of data;software engineering","SaaS provider;access policies;application deployment;cloud computing architectures based multitenant IDS;data access;data center;data protection;maintenance costs;multitenancy aspect;security issues;service assurance;service level agreement;software development","","0","","17","","","26-27 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Collaborative intrusion detection can be more secure with a framework using reputation aggregation as an incentive. The problem of incentives and efficiency are well known problems that can be addressed in such collaborative environment. In this paper, we propose to use game theory to improve detection and optimize intrusion detection systems used in collaboration. The main contribution of this paper is that the reputation of HIDS is evaluated before modeling the game between the HIDS and attackers. Our proposal has three phases: the first phase builds reputation evaluation between HIDS and estimates the reputation for each one. In the second phase, a proposed algorithm elects a leader using reputation value to make decisions. In the last phase, using game theory the leader decides to activate or not the HIDS for optimization reasons.","","","","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693381","False Alarm;Game Theory;Intrusion Detection;Resource Consumption","Collaboration;Game theory;Games;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Vectors","computer crime;game theory;groupware","HIDS;attackers;collaborative intrusion detection;game theory;heterogenous networks;host-based intrusion detection systems;incentives;malicious behaviors detection;reputation aggregation;reputation evaluation;reputation-based distributed intrusion detection","","0","","21","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particular areas of concern are the deliberate and intended actions associated with malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, or the compromise of networks, communications or other IT resources, of which the most harmful and difficult to detect threats are those propagated by an insider. However, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information, such as what is found in document control and management systems, are limited in scope and capabilities. In order to address this issue, this effort involves performing further research and development on the existing graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) system. GBAD discovers anomalous instances of structural patterns in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. Input to GBAD is a labeled graph in which entities are represented by labeled vertices and relationships or actions are represented by labeled edges between entities. Using the minimum description length (MDL) principle to identify the normative pattern that minimizes the number of bits needed to describe the input graph after being compressed by the pattern, GBAD implements algorithms for identifying the three possible changes to a graph: modifications, insertions and deletions. Each algorithm discovers those substructures that match the closest to the normative pattern without matching exactly.","","978-0-7695-3568-5","","10.1109/CATCH.2009.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804450","","Communication system security;Computer security;Control systems;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Pattern matching;Personnel;Terrorism","graph theory;pattern matching;security of data","insider threat detection;labeled graph-based anomaly detection system;labeled vertex;minimum description length principle;normative pattern matching;unauthorized access identification","","4","","8","","","3-4 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At present, businesses are facing with fast growing data that are very valuable in contributing knowledge. Knowledge should be updated regularly in order to ensure its quality and precision thus improve the decision making process. Data mining has shown great potential in extracting valuable knowledge from large databases. However, current data mining algorithms and tools are costly and several are too complex in their operations when dealing with large databases. In recent years, agents have become a popular paradigm in computing, because its autonomous, flexible and provides intelligence. Embedding agents in the current data mining processes and tools are believed to be able to solve the obstacle. One of the most important process in data mining is data preprocessing. It is reported that 60% of the data mining project is on preprocessing. Data preprocessing involves integration, selection, cleaning and transformation of data set that will be used for mining. This paper focuses on an agent-based preprocessing framework. The aims is to provides an auto preprocessing a set of new data, which suite to data mining novice user. The proposed agent based preprocessing framework consists of seven agents: user interface agents, coordinator agent, identify agent, CleanMiss agent, CleanNoisy agent, transformation agent and discretization agent. User interface agent is designed in such a way to provide interface suite to novice users. Coordinator agent is responsible for coordinating and cooperating with all other agents to achieve the goals. Identify agent responsible to provide an adaptive user data cleaning profiling. CleanMiss agent, CleanNoisy agent, transformation agent and discretization agent provide various types of techniques autonomously, which ended with proposing the best cleaning techniques from various types of techniques to keep in the preprocessing profile. This paper is - - start by introducing the data mining process problem includes data preprocessing which agent can solve data mining problems.

In order to design and develop reliable and secure network services, rapid detection and quick response to these attacks are major concern. In practice, there is no scheme that completely detects or prevents the DDoS attack. Predicting number of zombies in a DDoS attack is helpful to suppress the effect of DDoS attack by filtering and rate limiting the most suspicious attack sources or improve DDoS response system. In this paper, we present machine learning approach based on support vector machine for regression to predict the number of zombies in a DDoS attack. MATLAB implementation of support vector machine for regression and datasets generated using NS-2 network simulators running on Linux platform are used for training and testing. SVM for regression with various kernel function and other parameters are compared for their prediction performance using mean square error (MSE).

In this work, we focus the exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.15.4 low rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) MAC layer. This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior.

In Naive Bayes model, the word probabilities for a class are estimated by calculating the likelihood in the entire training documents where the training and test data are split randomly into k-subsets like 2/3 for training and 1/3 for test data.

We adapt the EM algorithm to estimate the distribution parameter of Gaussian mixture distribution model. If only there is a statistical signature of unusual fluctuation or change in the network traffic an alarm will be triggered. We adapt the time series analysis of the statistical analysis result. Up bound and low bound will be defined through the analysis. The exceeding of the bound will be the signal of traffic anomaly. Another time series analysis approach also can reflect the fluctuation of network with the crossover of two indicator lines called K line and D line.

"Reorganized and Compact DFA for Efficient Regular Expression Matching","Kai Wang; Yaxuan Qi; Yibo Xue; Jun Li","","Communications (ICC), 2011 IEEE International Conference on","20110728","2011","","","1","5","Regular expression matching has become a critical yet challenging technique in content-aware network processing, such as application identification and deep inspection. To meet the requirement for processing heavy network traffic at line rate, Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is widely used to accelerate regular expression matching at the expense of large memory usage. In this paper, we propose a DFA-based algorithm named RCDFA (Reorganized and Compact DFA), which dramatically reduces the memory usage while maintaining fast and deterministic lookup speed. Based on the dissection of real-life DFA tables, we observe that almost every state has multiple similar states, i.e. they share identical next-state transitions for most input characters. However, these similar states often distribute at nonadjacent positions in the original DFA table. RCDFA aims at reorganizing all similar states into adjacent entries, so that identical transitions become consecutive along the state dimension, then compresses the reorganized DFA table utilizing bitmap technique. Coupled with mapping along the character dimension, RCDFA is not only efficient in DFA compression, but also effective for hardware implementation. Experiment results show, RCDFA has superior performance in terms of high processing speed, low memory usage and short preprocessing time.

The 3rd ACS/IEEE International Conference on","20050613","2005","","","98","","Summary form only given. In the current research, we present an operation framework and protection mechanism to facilitate a secure environment to protect mobile agents against tampering. The system depends on the presence of an authentication authority. The advantage of the proposed system is that security measures are an integral part of the design, thus common security retrofitting problems do not arise. This is due to the presence of the ElGamal encryption mechanism to protect its confidential content and any collected data by the agent from the visited host. Therefore, eavesdropping on information from the agent no longer reveals any confidential information. Also, the inherent security constraints within the framework allow the system to operate as an intrusion detection system for any mobile agent environment. The mechanism is tested for most well known severe attacks against agents and networked systems. The scheme proved to have promising performance that highly recommends it for the type of transactions that needs highly secure environments, e. g., business to business.","","0-7803-8735-X","","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387089","","Authentication;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Protection;Software agents;System testing","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile agents","ElGamal encryption mechanism;MANET;authentication authority;confidential information;highly secure environments;intrusion detection;mobile agent protection mechanism;secure environment;security constraints;security retrofitting problems","","1","5","18","","","2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection is required as an additional wall for protecting systems despite of prevention techniques and is useful not only in detecting successful intrusions, but also in monitoring attempts to security, which provides important information for timely countermeasures. This paper presents some improvements to some of our previous approaches using a Non-negative Matrix factorization approach.

However, to prevent inside attackers, it should be accompanied with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism. The protocol is storage scalable and its efficiency is confirmed by the results obtained from simulation experiments.","1550-445X","978-1-4799-3629-8","","10.1109/AINA.2014.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838720","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Key Management;Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET);Secure Routing","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Mobile computing;Public key;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols","MANET;broadcast key distribution mechanism;integrated localized key management protocol;intrusion detection system;key management protocol;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor based handshaking and least common multiple;public key cryptography;routing protocol;routing security","","1","","18","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once a computer is compromised, an attacker may alter files, add new files or delete existing files. The changes that attackers make may target any part of the filesystem, including metadata along with files (e.g., permissions, ownerships and inodes). The accuracy of detecting an intrusion depends on the data audited: if an intrusion does not manifest in the data, the intrusion will not be detected. Moreover, not all files, which contain filesystem activity, are suitable to detect intrusions, as some may fail to provide useful information. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that focused on filesystem attack activity after a SSH compromise. Three types of attacker action are considered: reconnaissance, password modification, and malware download. For each type of action, we evaluated the files to audit using metrics derived from the field of information theory and estimated with the empirical SSH compromise data.","","978-0-7695-3698-9","978-0-7695-3698-9","10.1109/NCA.2009.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5190368","Intrusion detection systems;SSH compromise;attacker behavior;empirical analysis;filesystem data;honeypots","Application software;Computer applications;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Event detection;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Reconnaissance;Software tools;USA Councils","Bayes methods;authorisation;entropy;file organisation;invasive software;meta data;optimisation;probability","Bayesian metric;data auditing;empirical SSH compromise data;entropy-based metric;file evaluation;filesystem attack activity;filesystem data monitoring;honeypot;information theory;intrusion detection system;malware download;meta data;optimization problem;password modification;probability;reconnaissance action;unauthorized user","","0","","29","","","9-11 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On each node, the defender can choose one of several security modes available. We try to answer the following questions: 1) What is the expected behavior of a rational attacker?; 2) What is the optimal strategy of the defender?; and 3) Can we configure the security modes on each node to discourage the attacker from launching any attacks? In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI. Using our model, we derive the minimum defense resources required and the optimal strategy of the defender.

We believe that using unsupervised learning methods can help to classify data that allows analysts to find out meaningful insights and extract the value of the collected data more precisely and efficiently. This study demonstrates how the technique of growing hierarchical self-organizing maps (GHSOM) can be utilized to facilitate efficient event data analysis. For the collected IDS traces, GHSOM is used to cluster data and reveal the geometric distances between each cluster in a topological space such that the attack signatures for each cluster can be easily identified. The experimental results from a real-world IDS traces show that our proposed approach can efficiently discover several critical attack patterns and significantly reduce the size of IDS trace log which needs to be further analyzed. The proposed approach can help internet security administrators/analysts to conduct network forensics analysis, discover suspicious attack sources, and set up recovery processes to prevent previously unknown security threats such as zero-day attacks.","","","","10.1109/BDCloud.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034762","cloud services;forensic analysis;growing hierarchical self-organizing map;internet security;intrusion detection system","Correlation;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;data analysis;digital signatures;pattern classification;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","GHSOM;IDS traces;Internet security administrators;Internet security analysts;analytical approach;attack signatures;cloud services;cluster geometric distances;complex data pattern parsing;critical attack patterns;data classification;data clustering;event data analysis;event pattern discovery;growing hierarchical self-organizing maps;heterogeneous data analysis problem;intrusion detection rule sets;intrusion detection system;network forensics analysis;recovery process;suspicious attack source discovery;topological space;unsupervised learning methods","","0","","22","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed system utilises both a global and a local approach, and is thus able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet. Apart from these obvious advantages, PROTOS supports a large-scale installation and can be extended even further to improve the effectiveness by incorporating prediction and forecasting techniques.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2014.000070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6896564","Computer virus;forecasting;intrusion detection;security;time series","Computer architecture;Databases;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;computer viruses;public domain software","DDoS;Internet threat level estimation;PROTOS;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed-complex system;forecasting technique;global-local approach;large-scale installation;malicious activity estimation;malware;open-source early warning system;prediction technique;proactive threat observatory system","","0","","30","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Today, there are so many intrusion detection systems (IDS) on the Internet. A variety of intrusion detection techniques and tools exist in the computer security community. We can easily download, install and configure them to our needs. But there is a potential problem involved with intrusion detection systems that are installed locally on the machines to be monitored. If the system being monitored is compromised, it is quite likely that the intruder will alter the system logs and the intrusion logs while the intrusion remains undetected. In this project KIT-I, we adopt remote logging server (RLS) mechanism, which is used to backup the log files to the server. Taking into account security, we make use of the function of SSL of Java and certificate authority (CA) based on key management. Furthermore, neural networks are applied in our project to detect the intrusion activities.","","0-7803-9044-X","","10.1109/ICMA.2005.1626666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1626666","","Collaboration;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Explosives;File servers;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Neural networks;Remote monitoring;Web server","Internet;Java;neural nets;security of data;system monitoring","Internet;Java;SSL;certificate authority;collaborative intrusion detection system;computer system security;key management;neural networks;remote logging server","","0","1","11","","","29 July-1 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work focuses on large network while previous works focus on LANs. We proposed rules to choose these routers based on the network topology and based on risk assessment. Many topological factors are considered into the control strategy process, the control router sets selecting algorithm based on entropy was put forward. According to the incidents distribution on the topology, the factor of macroscopic epidemic status is proposed by the method of quantitative and qualitative analysis, which offers administrators the direct decisive advice to prevent network security event from overspreading and minimize the costs.

Many systems including mobile and desktop applications are protected by SSL/TLS protocols against network attacks. However, many vulnerabilities caused by incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs have been uncovered in recent years. Such vulnerabilities, many of which are caused due to poor API design and inexperience of application developers, often lead to confidential data leakage or man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper, to guarantee code quality and logic correctness of SSL/TLS applications, we design and implement SSLINT, a scalable, automated, static analysis system for detecting incorrect use of SSL/TLS APIs. SSLINT is capable of performing automatic logic verification with high efficiency and good accuracy. To demonstrate it, we apply SSLINT to one of the most popular Linux distributions -- Ubuntu. We find 27 previously unknown SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in Ubuntu applications, most of which are also distributed with other Linux distributions.","1081-6011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163045","","Accuracy;Libraries;Protocols;Security;Servers;Software;Testing","Linux;application program interfaces;formal verification;program diagnostics;protocols;security of data","API design;Linux distributions;SSL usage vetting;SSL-TLS protocols;SSLINT;Ubuntu;application program interfaces;automatic logic verification;code quality;logic correctness;network attacks;secure sockets layer;static analysis system;transport layer security","","0","","52","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using an autoregressive system to model the network traffic, predictor error is shown to closely follow a Gaussian distribution. CFAR detector approaches are then developed on the prediction error distribution. In the present study, we consider the optimal CFAR, the cell-averaging CFAR, and the order statistics CFAR. The use of these CFAR techniques can significantly improve the detection performance. In addition, we propose the use of fusion of these CFAR detectors by using Dempster-Shafer and Bayesian techniques. Computer simulations based on the DARPA traffic data show that the proposed approach achieves higher detection probabilities than the conventional detection method.

High dimensional dataset degrades the performance of learning algorithm as learning algorithm try to analyze and accommodate all the features. Feature selection technique is used as a pre-processing step to analyze and compress large data set. The main objective of feature selection technique is to identify relevant features and removes redundant features from high dimensional dataset. The main goal of feature selection technique is to reduce dimensions of dataset, improve classification accuracy, reduce computational cost, and better visualization of data. By considering only useful features, the performance of classification algorithm can be improved. To select reduced set of relevant features from set of all features, various search techniques such as complete search, random search and sequential search etc. are used. Each generated subset of features is validated using various evaluation techniques such as filter, wrapper, and hybrid approach. The main aim of any search technique is to generate optimal subset of features. A general methodology of feature selection process is summarized in this paper on the basis of search and evaluation techniques. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent developments in feature selection techniques.
