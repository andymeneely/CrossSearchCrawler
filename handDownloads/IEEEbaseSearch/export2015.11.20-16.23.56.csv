Web applications are under siege from cyber criminals seeking to steal confidential information and disable or damage the services offered by these application. Therefore, additional steps must be taken to ensure data security and integrity of the applications. In this paper we propose an innovative solution to filter the SQL injection attack using SNORT IDS. The proposed detection technique uses SNORT tool by augmenting a number of additional SNORT rules.

This paper introduces a novel trust model to evaluate the grid and cloud resources by means of resource broker. The resource broker chooses appropriate grid/cloud resource in heterogeneous environment based on the requirements of user. Our proposed trust management system is implemented with Kerberos authentication and PERMIS (privilege and role management infrastructure standard) authorization to enhance the trust of the broker itself.

A novel FPGA-based, programmable IP flow monitor is presented, that permits various forms of network monitoring functionality, specifically monitoring of different classes of traffic, to be performed. A key aspect was to address the traditionally long design times, through the use of a new, experimental, high-level design flow called Packet Xpress which allowed functions to be quickly implemented, providing a twentyfold speed-up in design time. The monitor has been implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 based ML506 board and verified in hardware using real Internet traffic traces.

Feature selection or attribution reduction can help reduce the SVM classification time and saving memory space effectively. This paper concerns using rough set for attribution ranking and reducing and using support vector machine for intrusion detection classification. An elicitation attribution reduction algorithm (EARA) based on attribution significance and discernibility matrix is presented and three data discretization algorithms were applied to identify the important attributions. The classification performance of the presented algorithm and classical SVM were compared in accuracy, time, false positive rate, and detection rate.

In this paper, we show a test-bed that we have developed to detect vulnerabilities within SCADA protocols against internal attacks in order to find out how easy it is to bypass security measures in such protocols. Furthermore, we have tested SCADA components to assess their vulnerabilities against the following attacks: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, replay attacks, cryptographic attacks, and fragmentation attacks.

So in this paper we propose a novel classification of worms which is much exhaustive as compared to earlier classifications, includes recent worm attacks and gives better and quicker understanding of recent worm behavior so that accurate defense mechanism can be designed very quickly. This paper discusses honeypot with signature based detection and honeypot with anomaly based detection. Further a novel hybrid scheme is proposed that integrates anomaly and signature detection with honeypot.

Security auditing is a good way to deal with the threats faced by a cloud data center. But traditional auditing is no longer suitable for the new cloud environment. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate the CDCAS, a novel cloud data center auditing system, which matches the demand of the scalability and efficiency of a cloud data center. In this system, we design one distributed and autonomous agent model which can be controlled by a set of rules dynamically generated to fit its use scenario. We then build the log analysis model which uses the signature based method and correlative analysis algorithm to extract security events from collected log with agreeable false positives. We evaluate our system both on real world and simulation to validate its efficiency.

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

Computer networks are typically built from a large number of network devices such as routers, switches and numerous types of middle boxes with many complex protocols implemented on them.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture purporting to be adaptable, cost-effective, dynamic and manageable pursuing to be suitable for the high-bandwidth, changing nature of today's applications. SDN architectures decouples network control and forwarding functions, making network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted from applications and network services. The network security is a prominent feature of the network ensuring accountability, confidentiality, integrity, and protection against many external and internal threats. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a type of security software designed to automatically alert administrators when someone or something is trying to compromise information system through malicious activities or through security policy violations. Security violation in SDN environment needs to be identified to prevent the system from an attack. The proposed work aims to detect the attacks on SDN environment.

ICCT '06. International Conference on","20070410","2006","","","1","4","Intrusion detection is a critical component of secure information systems. Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) especially NIDS (network intrusion detection system) examine all data features to detect intrusions. However, some of the features may be redundant or contribute little to the detection process and therefore they have great impact on the system performance. This paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model that is computationally efficient and effective based on feature selection and maximum entropy (ME) model. Firstly, the issue of identifying important input features is addressed. Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, therefore results to faster and more accurate detection. Secondly, classic ME model is used to learn and detect intrusions using the selected important features. Experimental results on the well-known KDD 1999 dataset show the proposed model is effective and can be applied to real-time intrusion detection environments.","","1-4244-0800-8","1-4244-0801-6","10.1109/ICCT.2006.341771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4146353","","Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Computer vision;Entropy;Information systems;Intrusion detection;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","feature extraction;maximum entropy methods;security of data;telecommunication security","feature selection;lightweight intrusion detection model;maximum entropy model;network intrusion detection system","","2","","8","","","27-30 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The majority of the data-plane traffic is distributed via the switch's built-in traffic distribution function and no connection state is kept. If the load balancing controller detects a skew in the load of the DPP appliances, it updates the traffic rules in the switch to redirect new connections to less busy DPP appliances. This adaptive solution is beneficial for load-balancing at high data rates because state is kept for only the redirected connections. For typical traffic patterns, our solution reduces the packet drops with minimal connection redirection. We show an example capture, where we are able to improve the packet drop rate by 94.8% with only 3% of the connections being redirected.","1944-0367","978-1-4577-1264-7","","10.1109/LANMAN.2011.6076946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076946","","Clocks;Hardware;Home appliances;IP networks;Servers;Switches","local area networks;resource allocation","DPP;Ethernet switch;adaptive load balancing;data plane traffic;deep packet processing;high performing scaleout solution;load balancing controller;traffic distribution function","","0","","7","","","13-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Industry and academies adopt the network security enabled hypervisor (NSE-H) to protect virtual machines (VM) residing in the virtual network. In this paper, we identified the insufficiency of the existing live migration implementation, which prevents itself from providing transparent VM relocation between NSE-Hs. This occurs because the contemporary migration implementation only takes VM encapsulated states into account, but ignores VM related security context(SC) needed by NSE-H embedded security engines (SE). We presented a comprehensive live migration framework for the NSE-H, considering both the execution context encapsulated in VM instance and the VM related security context within the SEs. We built a prototype system of the framework based on stateful firewall enabled Xen hypervisor. Our experiment was performed with realistic applications and the results demonstrate that the solution complements the insufficiency without introducing significant performance downgrade. Even in the worst case, the downtime that occurs during migration increases no more than 15%, comparing to existing implementation.","","978-1-4244-4590-5","978-1-4244-4591-2","10.1109/ICBNMT.2009.5347800","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5347800","hypervisor;live migration;network security;virtualization","Computer networks;Engines;Hardware;Platform virtualization;Protection;Resource virtualization;Space technology;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing","authorisation;computer networks;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","NSE-H;SE;VM execution context encapsulation;contemporary migration framework;efficiency 15 percent;embedded security engine;multiple operating system;network security enhanced hypervisor;network-base security device;prototype system;stateful firewall enabled Xen hypervisor;system virtualization technology;transparent VM relocation;virtual computing environment;virtual machine live migration","","4","1","21","","","18-20 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When network intrusions are suspected, an authority can release a key to an auditor, allowing the auditor to decrypt flows whose attributes (e.g., source and destination addresses, port numbers, etc.) fall within specific ranges. However, the privacy of all irrelevant flows are still preserved. We formally define the security for MRQED and prove the security of our construction under the decision bilinear Diffie-Hellman and decision linear assumptions in certain bilinear groups. We study the practical performance of our construction in the context of network audit logs.

The various personal information sharing practices that social network providers promote have led to their success as innovative social interaction platforms. At the same time, these practices have risen much critique and concerns with respect to privacy and security from different stakeholders. In fact, the massive use of online social networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way, every social network user should be able to easily access, control and analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated to it. The proposed event collector framework can collect all posted information and store it in a relational database for further analysis. Using a friendly graphical interface, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user behaviour. Since each event is stored with its corresponding timestamp, it is possible to perform an efficient analysis of all posted contents, compute statistics over collected data, infer/establish the so called ""normal"" or ""typical"" usage profile and, thus, be able to detect possible deviations that may correspond to a compromised user account.","","","","10.1109/NETWKS.2014.6959218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6959218","Monitoring Framework;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Databases;Facebook;Privacy;Security;Servers;Web pages","graphical user interfaces;relational databases;social networking (online)","daily digital interactions;graphical user interface;innovative social interaction platforms;relational database;social network events collection;user behaviour analysis","","0","","11","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, we analyze some existing cloud based intrusion detection systems (IDS) with respect to their type, positioning, detection time, detection technique, data source and attacks they can detect. The analysis also provides limitations of each technique to evaluate whether they fulfill the security requirements of cloud computing environment or not.

"Space-time tradeoff in regular expression matching with semi-deterministic finite automata","Yang, Y.E.; Prasanna, V.K.","Ming Hsieh Dept. of Electr. Eng., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","INFOCOM, 2011 Proceedings IEEE","20110630","2011","","","1853","1861","Regular expression matching (REM) with nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) can be computationally expensive when a large number of patterns are matched concurrently. On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|Σ|×p<sup>2</sup>×(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where Σ is the alphabet and c ≥ 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9919-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986","Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching","NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","","11","","26","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One-class SVM is a kernel based approach which is very fast and precise and therefore is used in different fields such as image processing, protein classification and anomaly detection for statistical learning. There are some approaches suggested for anomaly detection in MANETs that most of them are static and use a predefined model. Due to the dynamic characteristics of MANETs, they cannot be applied to these networks well. In this paper we have proposed a one-class SVM for dynamic anomaly detection in mobile ad-hoc networks with AODV routing protocol, called ManetSVM. The efficiency of ManetSVM for detection of flooding, blackhole, neighbour, rushing, and wormhole attacks has been evaluated. Simulation results show that ManetSVM is able to achieve a better balance between Detection Rate and False alarm Rate in comparison with other dynamic anomaly detection approaches.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767325","Anomaly detection;Mobile ad-hoc network;One-class classification;Statistical learning;Support vector machine","Ad hoc networks;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;statistical analysis;support vector machines","MANET;ManetSVM;blackhole;detection of flooding;detection rate;dynamic anomaly detection;false alarm rate;one-class classification;one-class support vector machine;routing protocol;statistical learning;wormhole attacks","","0","","15","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Safe operations can be enhanced by correctly designed device-level control algorithms as well as protocols, procedures, and operator training at the control-room level, but all of these can fail. Moreover, these elements exchange data and issue commands via vulnerable communication layers. To secure these gaps and enhance operational safety, the authors believe command sequence monitoring must be combined with an awareness of physical device limitations and automata models that capture safety mechanisms. One way of doing this is by leveraging specification-based intrusion detection to monitor for physical constraint violations. This method can also verify that the physical infrastructure state is consistent with information and commands exchanged by controllers. This additional security layer enhances protection from both outsider attacks and insider mistakes.","1540-7993","","","10.1109/MSP.2014.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7006406","cyber-physical system;energy system;intrusion detection;physics;safety engineering;security;specifications","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Control systems;Energy management;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Safety;Safety devices","control facilities;networked control systems;security of data","command sequence monitoring;control centers;correctly designed device-level control algorithms;embedded controllers;networked control system security monitoring;operations safety;physical device safety;security layer;specification-based intrusion detection;vulnerable communication layers","","0","","17","","","Nov.-Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many applications, it is important to take into account some extra knowledge in addition to the one encoded by the classifier. For example, in spam filtering which can be seen as a classification problem, it can make sense for a user to require that the spam filter predicts less than a given rate or number of spams. In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as ""it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal"" can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise classifiers' outputs in order to fit the expert knowledge. Experimental studies on intrusion detection and alert correlation problems show that our approach improves the performances on different benchmarks.","1082-3409","978-1-4799-0227-9","","10.1109/ICTAI.2012.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6495080","Decision trees;alert correlation;expert knowledge;intrusion detection","Bayes methods;Context;Correlation;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution","decision trees;pattern classification;security of data;statistical distributions","alert correlation;classification problem;decision tree classifier;expert knowledge;intrusion detection;probability distribution;spam filtering","","0","","32","","","7-9 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It acts as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) for the human body and detects anomalies that make the body deviate from its normal behavior. This inspired researchers to build artificial immune systems (AISes) which imitate the behavior of the HIS and are capable of protecting hosts or networks from attacks. An artificial immune system (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period. Although several AISes have been proposed, only a few make use of collaborative approaches. In this paper we propose P2P-AIS, a P2P approach for AISes in which peers exchange intrusion detection experience in order to enhance attack detection and mitigation. P2P-AIS implements Chord as a distributed hash table (DHT) protocol to organize the peers.","","978-1-4244-4623-0","978-1-4244-4624-7","10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5307053","artificial immune systems;distributed denial of service;intrusion detection;peer-to-peer systems","Artificial immune systems;Broadcasting;Computer crime;Computer science;Error correction;Floods;Humans;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols","artificial immune systems;cryptographic protocols;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Chord;DDoS flooding attacks;P2P-AIS;artificial immune system;distributed hash table protocol;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention system","","0","","20","","","23-26 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, MANET is venerable to attacks due to its mobile and ad hoc natures. The security issue is becoming a main concern in the applications of MANET. We consider the problem of decreasing the number of false positives generated by cooperative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level detection intrusion is proposed. The model utilizes the intelligent, lightweight mobile agent as alternative to the client server distribution model and nonoverlapping zone framework. So it can effectively detect complicated attacks. The data collection, data analysis, alert message and alarm message can be achieved by using mobile agents, which may reduce the data transmission to save the bandwidth resource in the MANET. The model can adjust itself dynamically to adapt to the change of the external environmental. Also the model is robust and scalable.","","978-1-4244-2282-1","978-1-4244-2283-8","10.1109/CANET.2008.4655310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4655310","","Communication system security;Data analysis;Data communication;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Network servers;Packet radio networks;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;security of data","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile agent intrusion detection system;multi-hop packet radio network","","1","","10","","","23-25 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intuitive approach - encrypting data before uploading to the cloud - is not applicable to MapReduce computation as the data analytics tasks are ad-hoc defined in the MapReduce environment using general programming languages (e.g, Java) and homomorphic encryption methods that can scale to big data do not exist.

In this paper, we explore whether the evolution of web browsers is done using systematic security regression testing. Beginning with an analysis of their current exposure degree to XSS, we extend the empirical study to a decade of most popular web browser versions. We use XSS attack vectors as unit test cases and we propose a new method supported by a tool to address this XSS vector testing issue. The analysis on a decade releases of most popular web browsers including mobile ones shows an urgent need of XSS regression testing.

Many solutions to the notorious problem were proposed. However, they had their own drawbacks. This paper presents a solution called API invocation fingerprint detection (AIFD) to eliminate overflow vulnerability with very low performance penalty. The solution is API-hook-based, which does not require compiler extensions or operating system kernel patches.

By it, programs protected will not yield control to the exploitation code, but rather enter a fail-safe state.

The UMIP model is designed to preserve system integrity in the face of network-based attacks. The usability goals for UMIP are twofold. First, configuring a UMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operating system. Second, existing applications and common usage practices can still be used under UMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example, it introduces several concepts for expressing partial trust in programs. Furthermore, it leverages information in the existing discretionary access control mechanism to derive file labels for mandatory integrity protection. We also discuss our implementation of the UMIP model for Linux using the Linux Security Modules framework, and show that it is simple to configure, has low overhead, and effectively defends against a number of network-based attacks.","1081-6011","0-7695-2848-1","","10.1109/SP.2007.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223222","","Access control;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Linux;Operating systems;Permission;Power system security;Protection;Usability","Linux;authorisation;systems analysis","Linux security module framework;mandatory usable access control system;network-based attack;operating system;usable mandatory integrity protection","","10","","24","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we study the ad hoc security vulnerabilities for which cryptographic-based solutions are ineffective and which require IDS. Appropriate designed IDS services appear essential as countermeasures to those threats, where previous IDS proposals often seem to be too sophisticated in the ad hoc environment and merely ineffective. Our goal here is to provide an IDS mechanism dedicated to the OLSR protocol, fitting to its characteristics and operation, and designed to avoid its vulnerabilities.

This requires the network management suit to monitor/analyze the aircraft related data (avionics data, physical security parameters, etc.) while determining the proper functioning of the overall system. In this paper, the authors present a framework for network management suit that, along with network health, monitors inputs from avionics, video surveillance system, weather monitoring system, and manual pilot alarms and based on the situation, reconfigures the onboard networking devices to stream appropriate flight critical data to the ground station.

Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative.

The network-wide dissemination of program code is not appropriate in every WSN due to the heterogeneity of sensor hardware, the diversity of sensing tasks, and the event and location dependency of software. Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography.

In an attempt to reduce the false alarm rate and processing time while increasing the detection rate, this paper presents a novel anomaly detection technique based on semantic interactions of system calls. The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques. The results show that our technique yields fewer false alarms and can handle large traces with smaller (or comparable) processing times compared against the existing techniques for the host based anomaly intrusion detection systems.","","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2013.6698896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698896","Host-based Intrusion Detection System;Software Reliability;Software Security","File systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Training","Linux;probability;security of data","Firefox dataset;Linux based program;UNM datasets;anomalous trace;anomaly identification;contemporary test suites;hacking technique;host based anomaly intrusion detection approach;kernel module state;normal trace;state interaction analysis;state occurrence probability;system behaviour visual understanding;system call representation;system call semantic interaction","","2","","38","","","4-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IIT 2008. International Conference on","20090210","2008","","","643","647","Snort is one of the most popular Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) that exist today. Snort needs to be highly effective to keep up with today's high traffic of gigabit networks. An intrusion detection system that fails to perform packet inspection at high rate will allow malicious packets to enter the network undetected. In this paper we demonstrate that the current default configuration of the Linux networking subsystem (a.k.a. NAPI) is not suitable for Snort's performance. We show that the performance of Snort can be improved significantly by tuning certain configuration parameters. In particular, we experimentally study the performance impact of choosing different NAPI budget values on Snort's throughput. We conclude that a small budget would enhance the performance significantly.","","978-1-4244-3396-4","978-1-4244-3397-1","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2008.4781733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781733","","Boosting;Computer science;Costs;Engines;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Linux;Software architecture;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","Linux;security of data","Linux networking subsystem;Snort throughput;malicious packets;network intrusion detection systems;packet inspection","","1","","15","","","16-18 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Raytheon is developing a system architecture and design for a perimeter security system that specifically addresses this issue for large facilities such as airports, seaports and rail facilities. The architecture uses the DoD's Architecture Framework guidelines. It employs a multi-sensor approach, including ground surveillance radars and cameras, to detect, assess and track perimeter incursions. It is designed to operate 24/7 in all weather conditions. A command and control center provides timely and accurate situational awareness to facility security personnel responsible for monitoring and managing incidents. Mobile communications also provide situational awareness to first responders in the field. The architecture supports integration with existing security systems, such as access control and closed circuit television, to centralize security monitoring for the entire facility. This architecture is the basis for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's Perimeter Intrusion Detection System for four airports, including John F. Kennedy International. Raytheon's system engineering process as applied to the perimeter security application is described, with focus on the key early process phases of threat analysis, operational concept generation, system requirements analysis, and system architecture and design development. Key technical parameters, including probability of detection and nuisance alarm rate, that drive the system design and cost are also discussed. Raytheon has found that the quality of the system engineering effort directly determines the quality of the resulting system and its ability to satisfy the customer's mission needs.","","1-4244-1053-5","1-4244-1053-5","10.1109/THS.2007.370022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4227785","","Airports;Cameras;Communication system security;Guidelines;Protection;Radar tracking;Rails;Surveillance;Systems engineering and theory;Transportation","monitoring;safety;security;sensor fusion;transportation","access control;cameras;centralize security monitoring;closed circuit television;detection probability;facility security personnel;ground surveillance radars;integrated perimeter security system;mobile communications;multisensor approach;nuisance alarm rate;operational concept generation;system engineering;system requirements analysis;weather conditions","","4","","","","","16-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose different strategies for delayed transmission and provide a performance analysis based on a series of simulation studies.

Malicious attacks on such systems are a growing concern, where attackers typically seek to degrade quality of service by intrusions that exploit vulnerabilities in networks, operating systems, and application software. Accordingly, designers are seeking improved techniques for validating such systems with respect to specified survivability requirements. In this regard, we describe a model-based validation effort that was undertaken as part of a unified approach to validating a networked intrusion-tolerant information system. Model-based results were used to guide the system's design as well as to determine whether a given survivability requirement was satisfied.","1060-9857","0-7695-2239-4","","10.1109/RELDIS.2004.1353019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353019","","Application software;Computer networks;Degradation;Distributed computing;Information security;Information systems;Operating systems;Quality of service;Software design;Software systems","computer networks;fault tolerant computing;formal verification;information systems;security of data","application software;computer systems;critical computational task;critical information-sharing;intrusion tolerant information system;local area network;malicious attacks;model-based validation;networked intrusion-tolerant information system;operating system;quality of service;survivability requirement;wide area network","","25","","17","","","18-20 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
