A grand challenge in this situation is that current management is inflexible and the security resource utilization is not efficient. The flexible deployment and utilization of proper security devices at reasonable places at needed time with low management cost is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new concept of network security virtualization, which virtualizes security resources/functions to network administrators/users, and thus maximally utilizing existing security devices/middle-boxes. In addition, it enables security protection to desirable networks with minimal management cost. To verify this concept, we further design and implement a prototype system, NETSECVISOR, which can utilize existing pre-installed (fixed-location) security devices and leverage software-defined networking technology to virtualize network security functions. At its core, NETSECVISOR contains: 1) a simple script language to register security services and policies; 2) a set of routing algorithms to determine optimal routing paths for different security policies based on different needs; and 3) a set of security response functions/strategies to handle security incidents. We deploy NETSECVISOR in both virtual test networks and a commercial switch environment to evaluate its performance and feasibility. The evaluation results show that our prototype only adds a very small overhead while providing desired network security virtualization to network users/administrators.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2453936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152892","Security;Software-Defined Networking;Virtualization;software-defined networking;virtualization","Communication networks;Monitoring;Prototypes;Routing;Security;Switches;Virtualization","computer network management;computer network security;software defined networking;virtualisation","NETSECVISOR prototype system;commercial switch environment;first step toward network security virtualization;fixed-location security devices;low management cost;network security devices;network security management;security policy;security protection;security resource utilization;security response functions;software-defined networking technology;virtual test networks","","0","","37","","2015-07-08","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Intrusion detection datasets are generally very large and contain many noncontributing features and redundant data. These drawbacks lead to inaccurate intrusion detection and increased computational cost when machine learning techniques are evaluated. Several data cleaning techniques have been proposed to eliminate redundant records and noncontributing features. These techniques reduce the size of the datasets significantly and make the characteristics of the data closer to the characteristics of intrusions in a real network. This paper identifies anomaly problems in normal and intrusion attacks data, and proposes an ellipsoid-based technique to detect anomalies and clean the intrusion detection datasets further. Publically available KDD'99 and NSL-KDD datasets are used to demonstrate its performance. It reveals an interesting property, i.e. monotonically decreasing behavior, of the NSL-KDD dataset.","1091-0050","978-1-4673-1374-2","","10.1109/SECon.2012.6196956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196956","KDD'99 dataset;NSL-KDD dataset;anomaly detection;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Ellipsoids;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Machine learning","learning (artificial intelligence);redundancy;security of data","KDD'99 datasets;NSL-KDD datasets;anomaly problems;data cleaning techniques;ellipsoid-based technique;intrusion attacks data;intrusion detection datasets;intrusion detection systems;iterative ellipsoid-based anomaly detection technique;machine learning techniques;redundant data;redundant record elimination","","1","","9","","","15-18 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Annual","20081222","2008","","","367","376","Anomaly detection (AD) sensors compute behavior profiles to recognize malicious or anomalous activities. The behavior of a host is checked continuously by the AD sensor and an alert is raised when the behavior deviates from its behavior profile. Unfortunately, the majority of AD sensors suffer from high volumes of false alerts either maliciously crafted by the host or originating from insufficient training of the sensor. We present a cluster-based AD sensor that relies on clusters of behavior profiles to identify anomalous behavior. The behavior of a host raises an alert only when a group of host profiles with similar behavior (cluster of behavior profiles) detect the anomaly, rather than just relying on the host's own behavior profile to raise the alert (single-profile AD sensor). A cluster-based AD sensor significantly decreases the volume of false alerts by providing a more robust model of normal behavior based on clusters of behavior profiles. Additionally, we introduce an architecture designed for the deployment of cluster-based AD sensors. The behavior profile of each network host is computed by its closest switch that is also responsible for performing the anomaly detection for each of the hosts in its subnet. By placing the AD sensors at the switch, we eliminate the possibility of hosts crafting malicious alerts. Our experimental results based on wireless behavior profiles from users in the CRAWDAD dataset show that the volume of false alerts generated by cluster-based AD sensors is reduced by at least 50% compared to single-profile AD sensors.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721573","Behavior Profile Clustering;False Alert Reduction;Network-based Anomaly Detection Sensors;Wireless Users","Application software;Collaboration;Communication switching;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Performance analysis;Robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Switches","security of data","anomalous activity;anomalous behavior identification;anomaly detection sensor;behavior-profile clustering;cluster-based AD sensor;false alert reduction;malicious activity;wireless behavior profile","","1","","16","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because traditional software alone pattern matching approaches can no longer meet the high throughput of today's networking, many hardware approaches are proposed to accelerate pattern matching. Among hardware approaches, memory-based architecture has attracted a lot of attention because of its easy reconfigurability and scalability. In order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful network intrusion detection system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement. For Snort rule sets, the new algorithm achieves 21% of memory reduction compared with the traditional Aho-Corasick algorithm. In addition, we can gain 24% of memory reduction by integrating our approach to the bit-split algorithm which is the state-of-the-art memory-based approach.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2028346","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272427","Aho–Corasick (AC) algorithm;finite automata;pattern matching","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Decoding;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Scalability;Throughput","memory architecture;pattern matching;security of data","Snort rule sets;bit-split algorithm;hardware design;memory architecture;memory reduction;network intrusion detection system;packet content inspection;pattern matching algorithm;pattern matching approach","","3","","30","","2009-09-29","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A generic Grid-IDS architecture is presented as well as a concrete realization based on various Web services specifications. At the heart of the introduced Grid-IDS architecture is the correlation service, which receives the event information from sensors distributed across the federation and detects intrusions by analyzing and correlating the events. A protocol-aware correlation service is proposed, in which each service protocol is abstracted to a generic representation - a relationship of roles.

The main idea of the method is network traffic is analyzed and estimated by using Relative Entropy Theory (RET), and a network anomaly detection model based on RET is designed as well. The numerical value of relative entropy is used to alleviate the inherent contradictions between improving detection rate and reducing false alarm rate, which is more precise and can effectively reduce the error of estimation.

Combining the geodesic projection to the spherical decision boundary resulting from the SVDD, together with solving the preimage problem, we propose a new method for pattern denoising. We first solve SVDD for the training data and then for each noisy test pattern, obtain its denoised feature by moving its feature vector along the geodesic on the manifold to the nearest decision boundary of the SVDD ball.

However, the effects of routing attacks on multi-path routing have not been addressed. In this paper, the performance of multi-path routing under wormhole attack is studied in detail. The results show that multi-path routing is vulnerable to wormhole attacks. A simple scheme based on statistical analysis (called SAM) is proposed to detect such attacks and to identify malicious nodes. Comparing to the previous approaches (for example, using packet leash), no special requirements (such as time synchronization or GPS) are needed in the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that SAM successfully detects wormhole attacks and locates the malicious nodes in networks with different topologies and with different node transmission range. Moreover, SAM may act as a module in local detection agents in an intrusion detection system (IDS) for wireless ad hoc networks.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420257","","Ad hoc networks;Counting circuits;Electric variables measurement;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;multipath channels;routing protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;malicious node location;multipath routing;routing protocol;statistical analysis;wireless ad hoc network;wormhole attack detection","","22","","26","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Access controls are used to protect against malicious attacks and to ensure that established database privileges are not misused. Intrusion detection systems can augment these controls by alerting the intrusion response team after an attack has occurred. While intrusion detection can assist forensic analysis, a passive response to detection can permit the inflicted damage to go undetected for a long period of time, allowing the damage to potentially propagate. In contrast, we propose an adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system to secure the database from attacks. The approach requires the database to learn the activities considered normal using training data taken from production. The model adapts to stringent variations of the training data while in operation, reducing the potential for normal activities to be misclassified as malicious.","","","","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974450","Database;Database Security;Intrusion Prevention Systems;Security Algorithms","Databases;Intrusion detection;Production;Semantics;Syntactics;Training data","authorisation;data protection;database management systems;digital forensics","access controls;adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system;database privileges;database roles;database security;fine-grained object access;forensic analysis;inflicted damage;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response team;malicious attacks protection;virtual private databases","","0","","18","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997497","","Automatic generation control;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Smart grids","power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;smart power grids","ACE;AGC;Markov models;area control error;automatic generation control;data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system;legacy energy infrastructures;short-term adaptive predictor;smart grid","","0","","20","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20090119","2008","","","156","163","The aggregate power consumption of the Internet is increasing at an alarming rate, due in part to the rapid increase in the number of connected edge devices such as desktop PCs. Despite being left idle 75% of the time, 90% of PCs have their power management features disabled. Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection. We use a novel partitioned TCAM technique that results in 87% energy savings and a 62% lower energy-delay product than existing non-partitioned router-based techniques, thus making our technique highly suitable for SNIC-based deployment.","1063-6404","978-1-4244-2657-7","978-1-4244-2658-4","10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751855","","Aggregates;Computer networks;Energy consumption;Energy management;Inspection;Internet;Network interfaces;Personal communication networks;Sleep;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;content-addressable storage;network interfaces;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet edge device;NIC-based packet content inspection system;green computing;low-power sleep state;network interface card;network intrusion detection;network traffic;next generation smart NIC;power management feature;power proxying;resource-constrained processing;ternary content addressable memory","","2","","25","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, packet-sampling mechanisms must be robust to adversarial hosts that craft packet streams that are disproportionately selected by a packet sampler. For example, a botnet flooding a network with packets in a denial-of-service attack, or a greedy customer trying to avoid being billed for network utilization, each have a strong incentive to craft packet streams that evade selection by the packet sampler. In this paper, we focus on securing the passive packet sampling mechanisms recommended by PSAMP (the IETF Packet Sampling working group [1]) against adversarial hosts. We show that (1) some of the packet sampling techniques suggested in current drafts of the PSAMP charter have security vulnerabilities, (2) secure uncoordinated sampling can be achieved using random sampling with a cryptographic random number generator, and (3) secure coordinated sampling requires a cryptographic pseudorandom function, keyed with a secret key that should be changed each time the sampler leaks information to the hosts.","","978-1-4244-2483-2","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567339","","Cryptography;Data engineering;Data security;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;cryptography;random processes;sampling methods;telecommunication traffic","Internet measurement application;cryptographic pseudorandom function;cryptographic random number generator;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end data-path quality;intrusion detection;packet sampling;security vulnerability;telecommunication traffic","","0","3","9","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional intrusion detection systems look for unusual or suspicious activity, such as patterns of network traffic that are likely indicators of unauthorized activity. However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely ""attack signature"", resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature. Experimental result shows that our method allows us to recognize not only known attacks but also to detect suspicious activity that may be the result of a new, unknown attack.

Many of the sandboxing systems proposed so far provide security by intercepting system calls invoked by an application and controlling their execution. However, a problem in existing sandboxing systems is the amount of overhead required for security checks performed after system call interceptions. In this paper, we propose a sandboxing system that executes speculative security checks. The proposed system predicts the behavior of a sandboxed application and executes speculative security checks in parallel with the application, thus reducing the overhead. Behavior is predicted based on system call profiles in past executions of the application.

The focus is not only on compression but also on database management through planning and best practice adoption to improve operational efficiency, and provide lower costs, privacy and security. The focus in this summary is on the compression part of the DMBS system for intrusion detection. We present a methodology employing grammar-based and large alphabet compression techniques which involves the generation of multiple dictionaries for compressing clustered subfiles of a very large data file. One of the dictionaries is a common dictionary which models features common to the subfiles. In addition, non-common features of each subfile are modeled via an auxiliary dictionary.

Sensor nodes placed in remote areas require less attention and supervision, but require significant battery power to survive long periods of time. Recharging or replacing batteries are difficult since units are often placed in areas which are difficult to access. Hence this technology requires sensor nodes to be as autonomic as possible where the nodes should be able to manage themselves without human intervention. We proposed a new mobile agent based energy efficient, self-healing framework for a sensor network. The proposed framework will be implemented in a real world prototype specifically providing detection of illegal entry to designated areas. Such an application might be useful in regulating cross-boundary passage of illegal immigrants to Malaysia.

IPDPS 2006. 20th International","20060626","2006","","","8 pp.","","Selective forwarding attacks may corrupt some mission-critical applications such as military surveillance and forest fire monitoring. In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks. The simulation results show that even when the channel error rate is 15%, simulating very harsh radio conditions, the detection accuracy of the proposed scheme is over 95%.","","1-4244-0054-6","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639675","","Application software;Base stations;Computer science;Error analysis;Fires;Intelligent networks;Military computing;Routing protocols;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","mission-critical application;multihop acknowledgement;security scheme;selective forwarding attacks detection;sensitive packet;wireless sensor network","","24","1","20","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, research on security metrics has been hindered by difficulties in handling zero-day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities has been considered as something unmeasurable due to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because a more secure configuration would be of little value if it were equally susceptible to zero-day attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting to rank unknown vulnerabilities, our metric counts how many such vulnerabilities would be required for compromising network assets; a larger count implies more security because the likelihood of having more unknown vulnerabilities available, applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will be significantly lower. We formally define the metric, analyze the complexity of computing the metric, devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and finally demonstrate through case studies that applying the metric to existing network security practices may generate actionable knowledge.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529081","Security metrics;attack graph;network hardening;network security","","computer network security","computational complexity;heuristic algorithms;k zero day safety;network security metric;software flaws","","2","","43","","2013-06-11","Jan.-Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the threat called security vulnerabilities is being faced on the other side. The damages suffered from such a threat are personal information leakage, unreasonable charging, root permission acquisition and so on. In addition, it is said that Android, which is considered as the most vulnerable operating system among the smart devices' operating systems, has the greatest damage of malware codes. Accordingly, this paper proposes a technique to detect malicious codes based on Android devices by using the multivariate time-series analysis. A variety of resource information is integrated into a resource to organize data, and an autoregressive moving average model of the time-series models is used to carry out the modeling. The modeled data is matched with real data to detect malicious codes.

We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner.

Therefore, it is important for network security in cloud. Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix. Using the information in Alert Correlation Matrix, we can extract high level attack strategies and construct attack graphs.

As a scalable and parameter-free unsupervised AD technique, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm has attracted a lot of attention for its applications in computer networks and WSNs. However, the nature of lazy-learning makes the kNN-based AD schemes difficult to be used in an online manner, especially when communication cost is constrained. In this paper, a new kNN-based AD scheme based on hypergrid intuition is proposed for WSN applications to overcome the lazy-learning problem. Through redefining anomaly from a hypersphere detection region (DR) to a hypercube DR, the computational complexity is reduced significantly. At the same time, an attached coefficient is used to convert a hypergrid structure into a positive coordinate space in order to retain the redundancy for online update and tailor for bit operation. In addition, distributed computing is taken into account, and position of the hypercube is encoded by a few bits only using the bit operation. As a result, the new scheme is able to work successfully in any environment without human interventions. Finally, the experiments with a real WSN data set demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and robust.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295612","Complexity theory;Detectors;Encoding;Monitoring;Real time systems;Training data;Wireless sensor network;Wireless sensor networks;anomaly detection;distributed computing;k-nearest neighbor;parameter selection","Complexity theory;Detectors;Encoding;Monitoring;Real time systems;Training data;Wireless sensor networks","computational complexity;hypercube networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","WSN;communication cost;computational complexity;computer network;cyberattack protection;distributed computing;hypercube DR;hypersphere detection region;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;lazy-learning problem;parameter-free unsupervised AD technique;positive coordinate space;random fault protection;scalable hypergrid k-NN-based online anomaly detection;wireless sensor network","","8","","30","","2012-09-05","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The aim is to predict, as well as to monitor, the security level, concentrating on the principal effects contributing to it. In addition, we introduce an on-the-fly security level estimation mechanism for mobile ad hoc networks. The mechanism can be used to support both node-level and network-level decision making. At the node level, it is possible to estimate constantly the security level for when choosing applications and communication mechanisms. At the network level, democratic voting among independent estimates originating from different nodes can be used to increase the level of security.","","0-7803-9121-7","","10.1109/MSHS.2005.1502553","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1502553","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Condition monitoring;Data security;Decision making;Information security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Safety","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;monitoring;parameter estimation;security of data;telecommunication security","decision making;dynamic self-organized monitoring system;hostile attacks;independent estimates;information security level estimation;integrated security metrics framework;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring system;on-the-fly security level estimation mechanism;safety monitoring systems;security monitoring systems;self-measurement mechanism;voting","","3","","29","","","29-30 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we advocate content parsing to empower SDN with finer grained control ability over traffic. Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace. When comparing with other six approaches on the real traces, COPY performs 4.2Gb/s and 24.7Gb/s with single- and eight-thread models, respectively, which improves 20%-860% than others, and consumes acceptable offline overhead in time and space.","","","","10.1109/ANCS.2015.7110120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110120","","Accuracy;Automata;Grammar;Payloads;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Semantics","automata theory;context-free grammars;program compilers;programming language semantics;protocols;software defined networking","COPY;DCA;DCCFG;SDN;application layer protocols;commodity hardware;content parsing;distinguishable counting automaton;distinguishable counting context free grammar;protocol semantics;software defined networking","","0","","38","","","7-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thanks to the advances in smart phones and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies, e-invoices can be delivered via NFC-enabled smartpones, allowing consumers to examine the content immediately after transactions and to easily retrieve them later on. Still, an extra security mechanism is needed to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of the content, as invoices may bear some value and thus become the target of a security attack.

In this paper, we present a multi-agent IDS architecture that is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks. An efficient and biologically inspired learning model is proposed for anomaly intrusion detection in the multi-agent IDS. The proposed model called ant colony clustering model (ACCM) improves the existing ant-based clustering approach in searching for near-optimal clustering heuristically, in which meta-heuristics engages the optimization principles in swarm intelligence. In order to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, four unsupervised feature extraction algorithms are applied and evaluated on their effectiveness to enhance the clustering solution.

Changes to satisfy telecommunication needs within the technical community have surfaced gradually through the efforts of international computer standards organizations, technical panels, and guidance committees. The design of a secure computer communications architecture to protect the integrity of information exchange is pursued by the aerospace industry, the commercial and financial sectors, and at all levels of government agencies. Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture. Intrusion detection techniques include signature identification of the intruder to locate and respond to network and host-based intruder attacks. Some of these same techniques will uncover the forensic evidence and explain how the computer or network system was compromised. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are another example of a security ap- - pliance. This network device employs security mechanisms such as tunneling, Internet protocol (IP) security protocols and cryptography. Insecure computer communications can have devastating consequences on national security, which would affect every aspect of daily life.

First, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is used to trim the original dataset, and a feature selection method, called GATS, which is based upon Genetic Algorithm (GA) embedded tabu search (TS), is used to extract the optimal subset from the reduced dataset. GATS integrates the concept of tabu list which may increase local search performance. Then, an incremental SVM with reserved set method (R-ISVM) is developed to deal with the problem of intrusion detection. Thirdly, according to the variations of classification hyperplane in incremental training, R-ISVM utilizes a concentric-circle model based reserved set strategy to maintain the samples that are most likely to be support vectors in future computation. Data experiments and comparisons with other popular intrusion detection approaches show that our presented method achieves better performance as well as stability.","","","978-1-84919-729-8","10.1049/cp.2013.2450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6825999","Feature Selection;Incrementally Learning;Network Intrusion Detection;Support Vector Machine","","genetic algorithms;search problems;security of data;support vector machines","DBSCAN;GATS;R-ISVM;SVM classification;classification hyperplane;concentric-circle model;density-based spatial clustering of application with noise;genetic algorithm;hybrid feature selection;incremental support vector machine;local search;network intrusion detection;network security;reserved set method;tabu search","","0","","","","","22-24 Nov. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

However in the CPU based systems, pattern matching is one of the most computation intensive parts. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a regular expression string matching programmable controller (SMPC). This special purpose controller is a parallel and pipelined processor architecture which can deal with the regular expression semantics. Two hardware stacks are implemented in SMPC to support fast branches when the non-matching occurs. Our implementation processes 4 characters per clock cycle (maximum performance of state of the art solutions) and occupies only O(n) memory (where n is the length of the regular expression). Via synthesizing the verilog description and analyzing area/time constraints, SMPC can achieve 200~400 times speedup over traditional CPU implementations and up to 7.9Gbps in processing throughput. Besides it outperforms the counterparts greatly as the complexity of regular expressions increases.","1934-1768","978-1-4673-2581-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6390960","fast branch;regular expression;special purpose controller;string matching","Clocks;Computer architecture;Educational institutions;Hardware;Pipelines;Protocols;Throughput","parallel processing;programmable controllers;security of data;string matching;unsolicited e-mail","CPU based system;SMPC controller;area-time constraints;network intrusion detection system;parallel processor architecture;pattern matching;pipelined processor architecture;processing throughput;programmable controller architecture;regular expression semantics;regular expression string matching;spam filtering;virus scanner","","0","","17","","","25-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within this context, enhancing the security of the future Smart Grid becomes a major priority. In this paper we introduce the use of data fusion for automated decision making in cyber-physical systems such as the Smart Grid. One of the most important applications of decision making is in the field of anomaly detection. This can enable the detection of attacks in cyber-physical systems without requiring a complete description of the physical process. The novelty of our approach is that is combines reports of various cyber and physical sensors, rather than focusing on either one single metric, or one singe realm, as was the case of similar techniques. Based on the proposed architecture we implement a new cyber-physical anomaly detection system. We show that data fusion is much more effective if it combines both cyber and physical realms, rather than focusing on the two realms separately.","","978-1-4577-1313-2","","10.1109/SMFG.2011.6125763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6125763","Cyber-Physical systems;Smart Grid;anomaly detection systems;data fusion","Engines;Floods;Sensors","decision making;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","cyber-physical systems;security;smart grid;theory of evidence-based automated decision making","","1","","14","","","14-16 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Threat assessment based on intention analysis is an important part of network security situation awareness. So how to recognize attack intention and assess threat has become a research hot in network security domain recently. In this paper attack path graph generation algorithms at a different granularity is presented at first. Then the methods of intrusive intention recognition and threat assessment based on attack path analysis are proposed. Next in order to block an attacker's intention to be achieved, the way to provide protective measures at minimum cost based on minimum vertex cut theory is addressed. Finally several experiments are done in a local network, and the results of the experiments prove the feasibility and validity of this method.","","978-0-7695-3843-3","978-1-4244-5068-8","10.1109/MINES.2009.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368840","attack path graph;intention recognition;minimum cut set","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Costs;Data security;Decision making;Information analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Scalability","computer network security;graph theory;pattern recognition","attack path analysis;attack path graph generation algorithm;intention analysis;intrusive intention recognition;minimum vertex cut theory;network security administrators decision-making support;network security situation awareness;threat assessment","","0","","8","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to their possible deployment in remote locations for civil, educational, scientific and military purposes, security, which includes intrusion detection and intrusion prevention, is of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose a simple, low complexity and energy-aware protocol for intrusion detection in WSN. The protocol is self-learning and distributed in nature. The distributed nature avoids all other nodes being sacrificed when a single node is compromised. The protocol juxtaposes the concept of stochastic learning automata on packet sampling mechanism to achieve an energy aware intrusion detection system. We have rigorously evaluated the performance of our proposed solution by performing a variety of experiments and have found our solution approach to be promising.","","978-1-4244-5487-7","","10.1109/COMSNETS.2010.5431976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431976","Intrusion Detection;Learning Automata;Wireless Sensor Networks","Biomedical monitoring;Condition monitoring;Energy efficiency;Feedback;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Proposals;Sampling methods;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","communication complexity;protocols;wireless sensor networks","WSN;energy efficient learning solution;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;low complexity;protocols;wireless sensor networks","","1","","42","","","5-9 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
