Therefore, packet analysis systems examine network traffic to detect active botnets and spreading worms. However, with the advent of multi-gigabit link speeds, capturing and analysing header and payload of every packet requires enormous amounts of computational resources and is therefore not feasible in many situations. We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets. Thus, our sampling algorithm can be deployed in front of a detection system to reduce the amount of inspected packets without degrading the detection results significantly.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-5366-5","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488473","","Filters;Forensics;High-speed networks;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Out of order;Payloads;Runtime;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;sampling methods","Bloom filters;TCP connections;botnet detection;malware;network security;packet sampling;sampling algorithm;worm detection","","5","","25","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the applications in this family need to search for predefined signatures in the packet payload. Hence an important building block of these processors is string matching infrastructure. Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters. We outline our approach for string matching at line speeds and present a performance analysis. Finally, we report the results for a prototype implementation of this system on the FPX platform. Our analysis shows that with the state-of-the-art FPGAs, a set of 10,000 strings can be scanned in the network data at the line speed of OC-48 (2.4 Gbps).","","0-7695-2012-X","","10.1109/CONECT.2003.1231477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231477","","Application software;Data structures;Hardware;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Inspection;Packet switching;Payloads;Performance analysis","data structures;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;packet switching;query processing;string matching","2.4 Gbit/s;FPGA;FPX platform;Internet security;content-based billing;deep packet inspection;false positive elimination;hardware Bloom filters;hash functions;layer-7 switching;membership queries data structure;network data line speed;network packet processing;packet payload predefined signatures;parallel Bloom filters;payload inspection;payload scanning;string matching infrastructure","","88","59","15","","","20-22 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sixth International Conference on","20070808","2007","","","16","16","Lack of infrastructure, central controlling authority and the properties of wireless links make mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) vulnerable to attacks. Several protocols have been proposed to make the routing protocols handle attacks in MANETs. These protocols detect the misbehaving nodes and re-route the data packets around them, mostly along the shortest such path. However, no single protocol handles all the attacks. A variant of the problem for routing around misbehaving nodes in ad hoc networks can be stated as: given a set of nodes under the danger of attack, one wishes to determine the path which is farthest from the endangered nodes. The problem does not address the problem of handling attack directly but tries to minimize the impact of attack. The problem also finds its applications in sensor networks. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm converges in O(d<sup>2</sup>) time where d is the diameter of the network.","","0-7695-2805-8","0-7695-2805-8","10.1109/ICN.2007.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196209","","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Centralized control;Computer science;Costs;Jamming;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Transfer functions","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MANET;data packet routing;minimum exposed path to attack;mobile ad hoc network;routing protocols;wireless links","","1","","24","","","22-28 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current implementations allow passengers to access Internet for pleasure and in some cases secure VPN access is provided to corporate networks. Several researchers are looking at the possibility of the existence of a total three networks: passenger network (PN), crew network (CRN), and the control network (CON). Researchers envision an architecture where these three networks co-exist in an airplane. The available Internet connectivity can be utilized for transporting flight critical information like cockpit flight data recorder (CFDR) data, digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data, cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data and controller pilot data link communication. In addition, the Internet connectivity could also be used for other safety mechanisms like video surveillance and remote control of the flight. Security is one of the major concerns that affect the successful deployment of aircraft data networks (ADN) and other safety features. Several studies have been carried out to secure the network using firewalls and intrusion detection system but so far no study has focused on securing the communication channel (between the aircraft and the ground station) and its impact on the ADN. The scope of this research is to determine the viability and need of a security mechanism.

Bluetooth, WiFi, and cellular technologies interconnect mobile devices with other computing devices and represent vectors into the device that may be exploited by malicious persons. A malicious person can theoretically take complete control of a mobile device via wireless and use it for all kinds of illicit purposes. While some malicious codes have been reported in the literature for these devices, it is only a matter of time before these codes become as common on mobile devices as they are on desktop computers. Most people have had an experience with a virus on their desktop PC, but have not had the same experience on their smart phone. This will change.

The contemporary trends in the software industry indicate dedicated efforts to minimize these unforeseen faults, thereby minimizing the chances of unforeseen failures. One of the definitive ways is to analyze the specifications thoroughly for the potential faults it may contain. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is one such approach that scans the specifications to identify potential failure modes and has been used successfully in many domains including software. In this paper, we propose an approach to generate test cases from UML activity diagram specifications by first transforming an activity diagram into a Software Success Tree (SST) and a Software Fault Tree (SFT). Subsequently, the SST and the SFT are then used to generate test cases for testing the normal and exceptional behavior of the system, respectively.

Distribution of video and of live contents also experienced the P2P mechanisms with success. PPLive, UUSee and others have many of customers, hundreds of channels and thousands of concurrent users. However, major content providers are reluctant to use this technology because no solution to ensure the distribution of only legal contents is provided. In the same way, network operators do not really push towards P2P content distribution because bad organization of the overlay can lead to overload the network and consume a lot of networks resources. In this paper, a secure and legal network-aware P2P video system is introduced, which aims at overcoming those two drawbacks. The design of the system and the evaluation of a prototype showed good results and let us be optimistic about a possible deployment of P2P systems for video delivery, having the support of content providers as well as network operators.","","978-1-4244-6728-0","","10.1109/ICIW.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476763","P2P Video Streaming;legal contents;network-awareness;secure distribution;watermarking","Computer architecture;Design optimization;IP networks;Law;Legal factors;Peer to peer computing;Prototypes;Video sharing;Watermarking;Web and internet services","computer network security;content management;peer-to-peer computing;video on demand;video streaming","P2P VoD system;P2P video system;content distribution;file sharing;network operator;peer-to-peer network;video delivery","","1","","20","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the popularity of this technology, it became targeted victim of different attacks. In this paper we analyzed VoIP architecture, both theoretically and practically with more emphasizes on security of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In order to analyze theoretically, we performed a literature survey related to SIP security and classified it in term of existing SIP attacks and defenses. Our theoretical analysis reveals that most attacks on VoIP architecture were successful due to weaknesses of SIP, especially the authentication mechanism used in the session establishment phase. For practical analysis, we used open source Asterisk and pen-test it in different attacking scenarios using Kali Linux distribution. Our practical analysis studies revealed that open source asterisk server is still vulnerable to several attacks, which includes eavesdropping, intentional interruption, social threats, interception and modification, and unintentional interruption. We also provide a concise mitigating scheme based on Single Sign-On (SSO), which provides an efficient and reliable authentication mechanism for securing SIP.","","978-1-4799-6088-0","","10.1109/ICET.2014.7021022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021022","Asterisk;PSTN;RTP;SIP;Security;VoIP","Authentication;Cryptography;Internet;Interrupters;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;telecommunication security","Kali Linux distribution;PSTN;SIP;VoIP;authentication mechanism;public switch telephone network;security analysis;session initiation protocol;voice over Internet protocol","","1","","33","","","8-9 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For each Unix process, the user credentials, which are user identifiers, determine the process privilege, including whether a process has gained a high privilege, such as that of the superuser. The state transition technique is applied to a suitably defined process state, identified by certain classes of user credential values. A transition takes place when these values change from one class to another. These states are clearly defined, and prohibited state transitions as well as some supporting rules are identified. When many break-ins succeed, either the rules are violated or these prohibited transitions occur, and this implies a violation of system security policy. A specially modified system call, ktrace0, is used by the superuser to monitor the process-state and state transition analysis is applied to the traced information, by the Intrusion Detection System. Tests show that most known security violations belonging to the targeted classes (such as buffer overflow exploits) can be detected (and possibly pre-empted) while the constituent activities are still being processed in the kernel","1063-9527","0-7695-0346-2","","10.1109/CSAC.1999.816050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=816050","","Intrusion detection","Unix;security of data","Intrusion Detection System;Unix process;break-ins;computer system;ktrace;process privilege;process state monitoring;process state transition analysis;prohibited state transitions;security breach detection;superuser;system call;traced information;user credential;user identifiers","","3","","21","","","1999","06 Dec 1999-10 Dec 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A 3 layers scan detection network is constructed where the node of every layer is source-IP, destination-IP and resource (the couple {destination port, protocol}), the link is the scan access connection between nodes. The scan detection network owns good features of layer and single-direction. A degree statistics method is put forward to grade the importance of nodes of the scan detection network and give proper warnings. By using a degree statistics method on honeypot dataset we can focus on the research of scan sources' behaviors and stand out what's really worthy of noticing and warning instead of staying at the procedure of identifying whether a source is a scanner or not.

The ONBIT test bed can be used to verify algorithms, concepts, and protocols, as well as discover more practical problems for future security research. This test bed is unique in its real-time nature and real-world performance and efficiency metrics, critical metrics for capabilities being readied for deployment. The ONBIT test bed was built using open source software and was designed to take accuracy and repeatability into consideration at each step of experimentation. Using a link emulator called Dummy Net, the ONBIT test bed has the ability to control how the network behaves. Dummy Net creates controlled packet loss, introduces latency, and allows for the configuration of various size network pipes. We show the benefit of correlating host-based and network-based IDS data in a real-world demonstration of the testbed's use.","","978-1-4673-0798-7","","10.1109/ITNG.2012.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209208","Computer Security;Deployability;Intrusion Detection;Network Testbed","Bandwidth;Delay;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers;Software;Testing","access protocols;computer network security;public domain software","DummyNet;IDS algorithms;IDS tools;ONBIT testbed;concept verification;controlled packet loss;host-based monitoring;link emulator;network pipe size;network-based monitoring;open network-host based intrusion detection testbed;open source software;protocol verification;repeatability;security research","","1","","14","","","16-18 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many environments (such as universities), end users relish having control over their own machines. However, if end users administer their own machines, nothing stops dishonest ones from marking undeserving traffic for high QoS. How can an enterprise ensure that only appropriate traffic receives high QoS, while also allowing end users to retain control over their own machines?

Their perceived success has led to the development of similar approaches in cyber security; information about previous attacks can be used to identify wider vulnerabilities and to inform future threat assessments. However, it can be difficult to integrate safety and security reporting within a single system. For example, in safety reporting systems the aim is often to disseminate lessons as widely as possible. In cyber security, there is a concern that this might motivate and inform further attacks. This paper identifies the challenges that arise in developing reporting schemes for security incidents in safety-critical applications. In particular we focus on the problems of implementing intrusion detection systems and coordinating forensic analysis without undermining system safety. These problems are exacerbated because existing cyber-security reporting guidelines focus more on office based systems than complex, command and control applications.","","978-1-84919-940-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111733","Cyber-Security;Forensics;Incident Reporting;Intrusion Detection Systems;Safety-Critical Systems","","digital forensics;safety-critical software","Cyber attack;Cyber-security incidents;coordinating forensic analysis;information vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;office based systems;reporting scheme;safety management systems;safety-critical systems;security incidents;threat assessment","","0","","","","","15-16 Oct. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In the proposed trust management scheme, the trust model has two techniques are trust from direct observation and trust from indirect observation. In direct observation, the trust value of observer node can be derived using Bayesian inference theory. Similarly the dempster-shafer functioned for neighbor node.

Two systems were evaluated, a representative signature-based commercial system and a DARPA research system that relies on statistically based techniques. The experiments tried to answer these questions: Are there regions of operation where the attack tool can degrade performance while escaping detection? Is there any added detection power using the research detection system over standard commercial practice?

Our leader election is based on Reputation value and energy level of each node. We have simulated in NS2 environment and shown the comparison of energy consumption or Residual energy of nodes having fixed transmission range with the proposed adaptive energy scheme. Adaptive energy scheme adjusts the range of transmission of each node based on the maximum distance between nodes in each cluster. Energy of each node is conserved as compared to node having fixed transmission range.

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults. In this work, a new monitoring technique using the CVA with UCLs derived from the estimated probability density function through kernel density estimations (KDEs) is proposed and applied to the simulated nonlinear Tennessee Eastman Process Plant. The proposed CVA with KDE approach is able to significantly improve the monitoring performance and detect faults earlier when compared to other methods also examined in this study.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2009.2032654","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290125","Canonical variate analysis (CVA);kernel density estimation (KDE);probability density function (PDF);process monitoring","","Gaussian distribution;fault diagnosis;principal component analysis;process monitoring","Gaussian assumption;Kernel density estimations;PCA;Tennessee Eastman Process Plant;canonical variate analysis;fault detection;industrial processes;nonlinear dynamic process monitoring;partial least squares;principal component analysis","","21","","19","","2009-10-20","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings of the IEEE International","20051107","2005","","","188","196","Network intrusion detection is becoming an increasingly important tool to protect critical information and infrastructure from unauthorized access. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well.

The proposed architecture integrates an intrusion detection system (IDS) into the network framework developed within the EU FP7 project ebbits. The aim is to detect DoS attacks based on 6LoWPAN. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, preliminary implementation was completed and tested against a real DoS attack using a penetration testing system.

In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) where security is a crucial issue and they are forced to rely on the neighbor node, trust plays an important role that could improve the number of successful data transmission. Larger the number of trusted nodes, higher successful data communication process rates could be expected.

Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.","","","","10.1109/MOBS.2013.6614222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614222","Information security;Mobile Networks;Moving Target Defense","Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Servers","computer network security;mobile computing;radio networks","attack avoidance;attack detection;cloud services;critical nodes;heterogeneous moving target networks;mobile applications;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile node instability;mobile-enabled systems;network communication characteristics;network-layer moving target defense;peer registration servers;static node security;static nodes","","0","","11","","","25-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Code generation is a technique used to convert data structures or instruction to other forms to obtain greater benefits within execution environments. This study analyzes intrusion detection system (IDS) signatures and discovers character occurrence to be significantly uneven. Based on this property, this study designs a method to generate a string matching source code according to the state table of AC algorithm for embedded network intrusion detection platforms. The generated source code requires less memory and relies not only on table lookup, but also on the ability of processor. This method can upgrade the performance by compiling optimization and contribute to the application of network processors and DSP-like based platforms.

The reduction algorithm is presented to cancel the redundant attribute set and obtain the optimal attribute set to form the input of the FCM. To find the reasonable initial centers easily, the advanced FCM is established, which improves the performance of intrusion detection since the traffic is large and the types of attack are various.

Each network packet is characterized using a novel technique that efficiently maps the payload histogram onto a simple pair of features using hypercube hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components. Results using the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Set yield a 100% detection of all applicable attacks, with extremely low false positive rate.

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.","","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166574","agents;intrusion detection;networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Magnetic heads;Network topology;Prototypes;Topology","Internet;mobile agents;security of data","IDSs;Internet;PlanetLab;agent deployment;agent roaming pattern;central node;intelligent mobile agents;intrusion detection system;network size;network topology;virtual network","","0","","7","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first step is the polymorphic worms sample collection which is done by the Double-honeynet system. The second step is the signature generation for the collected samples which is done by k-means clustering algorithm and a Multilayer Perceptron Model. The system collects different types of polymorphic worms, we used the k-means clustering algorithm to separate each type into a cluster.

Pattern match algorithm plays an important role in NIDS that performs searches against multiple patterns for a string match. Pattern matching is a computationally expensive task. Traditional software-based NIDS solutions usually can not achieve a high-speed required for ever growing Internet attacks. In order to satisfy high-speed packet content inspection, hardware-implementable pattern match algorithm is required. In this paper, we propose a hardware-based pattern match architecture that employs a multi-character processor array. The proposed multi-character processor array is a parallel and pipelined architecture which can process multiple characters of the input stream per cycle. The proposed architecture can reduce a lot of unnecessary computations and thus it is power efficient. We use snort pattern sets and DEFCON packet traces to perform our simulations.

However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","","","","1","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

By taking advantages of the main features of such models, coupled with nature based models such as artificial immune systems we present a novel artificial immune and agent based intrusion detection model for large computer networks. Our solution is based upon several security levels, event based model, and a simple computational abstraction where an anomaly detection technique is designed to monitor the users' registrations to the operational targeted system, e.g., UNIX-like implementation. In our model, the events' generation model is processed using the Unix Syslog-ng tool, the events' analysis using the Logcheck tool, while the activities of the users and the execution of the both reactive and pro-active events' activities are implemented within an artificial immune and mobile agent based infrastructure. We have implemented and designed our model to differentiate among attacks, security violations, and several other security levels. In this paper we present our model, and show how mobile agent and artificial immune paradigms can be used to design efficient intrusion detection systems. we also discuss the validation of our model followed by a set of experiments we have carried out to evaluate the performance of our model using realistic case studies.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420080","","Artificial immune systems;Complex networks;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Organisms;Security","Unix;computer network management;mobile agents;security of data","Logcheck tool;Unix Syslog-ng tool;agent based model;anomaly detection;computer network security;event generation;hybrid artificial immune system;intrusion detection system;mobile agent","","3","","16","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our method, first, compromised nodes are detected and then the nodes with the highest energy power from among valid nodes as IDS agent nodes are considered. So, with this method, some valid nodes contribute in intrusion detection activities and costs of the network monitoring will be reduced and the network lifetime will be increased.","","978-1-4244-5365-8","978-0-7695-3925-6","10.1109/ICCEE.2009.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380168","Compromised node;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);Network lifetime","Batteries;Computer networks;Costs;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Open systems;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","compromised nodes;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;network lifetime","","1","","23","","","28-30 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attacks like DoS, U2R, R2L and Probing etc., creating a serious threat to the appropriate operation of Internet services as well as in host system. In recent years, intrusion detection system is designed to prevent the intruder in the host as well as in network systems. Existing host based intrusion detection systems detects the intrusion using complete feature set and it is not fast enough to detect the attacks. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an efficient HIDS - Correlation based Partial Decision Tree Algorithm (CPDT). The proposed CPDT combines Correlation feature selection for selecting features and Partial Decision Tree (PART) for classifying the normal and the abnormal packets. The algorithm is implemented and has been validated within KDD'99 dataset and found to give better results than the existing algorithms.

Port scanning detection has received a lot of attention by researchers. However a slow port scan attack can deceive most of the existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this paper, we present a new, simple, and efficient method for detecting slow port scans. Our proposed method is mainly composed of two phases: (1) a feature collection phase that analyzes network traffic and extracts the features needed to classify a certain IP as malicious or not. (2) A classification phase that divides the IPs, based on the collected features, into three groups: normal IPs, suspicious IPs and scanner IPs. The IPs our approach classify as suspicious are kept for the next (K) time windows for further examination to decide whether they represent scanners or legitimate users. Hence, this approach is different than the traditional approach used by IDSs that classifies IPs as either legitimate or scanners, and thus producing a high number of false positives and false negatives. A small Local Area Network was put together to test our proposed method. The experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method in correctly identifying malicious scanners when both normal and slow port scan were performed using the three most common TCP port scanning techniques. Moreover, our method detects malicious scanners that are otherwise not detected using well known IDSs such as Snort.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122824","Intrusion Detection System;Port Scanning","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;IP networks;Probes;Security;Servers;Training data","local area networks;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IDS;TCP port scanning techniques;feature collection phase;intrusion detection systems;local area network;reconnaissance technique attackers;slow port scanning detection","","3","","20","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
