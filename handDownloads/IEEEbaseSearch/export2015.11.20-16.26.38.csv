Intrusion detection is a method to find and establish appropriate defenses against any malicious attack on the network. However standard intrusion detection practices alone cannot ensure the safety of the wireless sensor networks due to various constraints on the power, memory and battery life of the sensors and on many other uncertain factors.

Dept., Macquarie Univ., Sydney, NSW","Engineering of Complex Computer Systems, 2009 14th IEEE International Conference on","20090623","2009","","","202","209","In this paper we propose a dynamically invoked service based access control (SBAC) model to efficiently deal with the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The main idea of the SBAC is based on the observation that if the routers have information about the services that are running on the end host and can identify the upper layer traffic from the IP packet payload, then it becomes easy to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic for that particular victim server. To minimise the overhead on the routers, the SBAC model is invoked during the attack times only and the victimpsilas traffic is processed separately. The boundary routers in SBAC model validate each incoming packet to the victim on a per server basis. Only the packets that are considered to be accessing the legitimate services are passed and the remaining packets are dropped. Hence, at this stage the victimpsilas network is immune to any dynamic changes in attack pattern if the attack packets are not accessing the legitimate services at the victim end. The packets that are considered to be accessing legitimate services of the victim machine/network are marked with a unique ID and destined to the victim. If any of the received packets are found to be malicious, the unique ID enables the victim to identify service specific attack signature for each ingress SBAC router and prevent the attack traffic at that particular router. We will also discuss how the SBAC model deals with attacks on the infrastructure of the autonomous system.","","978-0-7695-3702-3","","10.1109/ICECCS.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090528","Access control;Autonomous System;Denial of Service;Traceback","Access control;Computer crime;Computer network management;Filtering;Information security;Intrusion detection;Reflection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;authorisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","DDoS attack;IP packet payload;Internet;SBAC router model;autonomous system;distributed denial of service attack;legitimate service;malicious attack traffic;service-based access control model","","4","","30","","","2-4 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So it's very difficult and limited to get the most risky alert through manual process based on the huge network alerts with many attributes. The common method used to rank the alerts is scoring function, the higher the score, the more risky of the alert. Our motivation is that many times, user can not precisely specify the weights for the scoring function as their preference in order to get the preferable Ranking. In this paper, we propose a sampling method to mining user's preference. Based on this preference, the most risky alerts can be easily ranked for emergency response.

A perfect compensation of the drift caused by the fault on the objective function is shown to be achievable using time varying gains; the set of such time-varying gains is computed and it is shown that it satisfies a suitable autoregressive equation. Further, we estimate the convergence region of the state vector when the proposed compensation technique is used in the presence of persistent unknown but bounded disturbances.

It is different from traditional AIS classifiers in that it takes only one B-cell, instead of a B-cell pool, to represent the classifier.

With the increasing popularity and rising demand for more public Wi-Fi hotspots, network service providers are facing a daunting task. Wi-Fi hotspots typically require extensive wired infrastructure to access the backhaul network, which is often expensive and time consuming to provide in such situations. wireless mesh networks (WMNs) offer an easy and economical alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity and could be called the web-in-the-sky. In place of an underlying wired backbone, a WMN forms a wireless backhaul network, thus obviating the need for extensive cabling. They are based on multihop communication paradigms that dynamically form a connected network. However, multihop wireless communication is severely plagued by many limitations such as low throughput and limited capacity. In this article we point out key challenges that are impeding the rapid progress of this upcoming technology. We systematically examine each layer of the network and discuss the feasibility of some state-of-the-art technologies/protocols for adequately addressing these challenges.

"Prevention of dropping routing traffic attack in wireless Ad-Hoc AODV-based networks using Real-time Host Intrusion Detection","Ibrahim, M.M.; Sadek, N.; El-Banna, M.","E-Gov.

It applies some special routing protocols, e.g. AODV, having the ability to forward the packets in dynamic network topology. The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the dropping traffic attack and after applying the developed HIDS is measured. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN technique reduces the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1110-6980","978-1-4244-4214-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233983","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized administration;dynamic network topology;mobile ad hoc network;multiple selfish nodes;network infrastructure;network performance;optimized network engineering tools;real-time host intrusion detection;routing protocol;routing traffic attack;secure protocol;simulated environment;wireless ad hoc AODV;wireless nodes","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to make these classifiers workable online. The idea is that different applications will show distinct traffic patterns from the very beginning of the flow, and so using statistics extracted from the first few packets can distinguish applications. Preliminary result shows that our method can achieve high flow accuracy, just a bit lower than using full-flow statistics. Using fewer packets per flow is promising, since it not only enables early classification and can easily apply to most of the existing classifiers, but also saves memory and computing power.","","978-0-7695-3336-0","","10.1109/CSSE.2008.911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4722720","machine learning;traffic classification","Computer science;Data engineering;Inspection;Machine learning;Payloads;Software engineering;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","data mining;machine learning;statistical flow;traffic classifiers online;traffic flows;traffic patterns","","2","","22","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an online data validation framework to verify home energy meters (EMs) in a secondary network with real-time measurements from feeder remote terminal units (FRTUs) in primary network. A potential cybertampering is identified based on three levels: 1) feeders; 2) subsystems; and 3) customers. This framework attempts to identify malicious consumers and their locations based on historical consumption pattern and network operating conditions in real time. The proposed framework is demonstrated to detect tampering activities using a realistic 12.47-kV distribution network.

We have been exploring deliberate deception in defensive tactics by information systems under cyber-attack as during information warfare. We have developed a tool to systematically ""counterplan"" or find ways to foil a particular attack plan. Our approach is to first find all possible atomic ""ploys"" that can interfere with the plan. Ploys are simple deceits the operating system can do such as lying about the status of a file. We analyze ploys as to the degree of difficulty they cause to the plan wherever they can be applied. We then formulate a ""counterplan"" by selecting the most cost-effective set of ploys and assign appropriate presentation methods for them, taking into account the likelihood that, if we are not careful, the attacker will realize they are being deceived and terminate our game with them. The counterplan can be effected by a modified operating system. We have implemented our counterplanner in a tool MECOUNTER that uses multiagent planning coupled with some novel inference methods to efficiently find a best counterplan. We apply the tool to an example of a rootkit-installation plan and discuss the results.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232422","","Access control;Computer hacking;Decision theory;Displays;Information systems;Inspection;Intelligent agent;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Technological innovation","computer crime;decision theory;inference mechanisms;information systems;military computing;multi-agent systems;operating systems (computers);planning (artificial intelligence);stochastic processes","MECOUNTER tool;atomic ploys;counterplanning;cyber-attack plans;decision theory;defensive tactics;information warfare;intelligent agents;military strategies;multiagent planning;operating system;stochastic models;tactical deception;toolkit-installation plan","","5","","17","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples.

Proceedings IEEE","20050822","2005","1","","524","535 vol. 1","The establishment of shared cryptographic keys between communicating neighbor nodes in sensor networks is a challenging problem due to the unsuitability of asymmetric key cryptography for these resource-constrained platforms. A range of symmetric-key distribution protocols exist, but these protocols do not scale effectively to large sensor networks. For a given level of security, each protocol incurs a linearly increasing overhead in either communication cost per node or memory per node. We describe peer intermediaries for key establishment (PIKE), a class of key-establishment protocols that involves using one or more sensor nodes as a trusted intermediary to facilitate key establishment. We show that, unlike existing key-establishment protocols, both the communication and memory overheads of PIKE protocols scale sub-linearly (O(√n)) with the number of nodes in the network yet achieving higher security against node compromise than other protocols.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1497920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1497920","","Base stations;Batteries;Computer architecture;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Elliptic curve cryptography;Energy consumption;Intelligent networks;Peer to peer computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization","cryptography;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PIKE;asymmetric key cryptography;network security;peer intermediaries for key establishment protocol;peer intermediary;resource-constrained platform;sensor network;symmetric-key distribution protocol","","75","","20","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic. This traffic-monitoring framework helps identify network activities of stealthy malware, and lends itself to a powerful personal firewall for examining all outbound traffic of a host that cannot be bypassed.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035722","Authentication;cryptography;malware;networking.;provenance","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Malware;Network security;System-on-a-chip","cryptography;formal verification;invasive software;protocols;trusted computing","TPM;critical system information;cryptographic provenance verification;data-provenance verification;malicious software;malicious traffic detection;malware;protocol;secure hosts;system-data integrity;trusted computing platform","","5","","37","","2011-10-06","March-April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Benchmarking data sets based on real data have many advantages over the artificially generated ones, but due to privacy concerns and legal restrictions such original data sets cannot be widely distributed. Their anonymization (""sanitization"") is necessary in order to be used in IDS testing. In this paper, we define a new variable strength filter-in methodology of anonymization of IDS benchmarking data sets. It is based on an original classification criterion used to categorize informational objects in network data according to the action to be performed on them in the anonymization process. The action depends on the possibility of these objects to disclose sensitive information. We analyze the possibility of disclosing sensitive information by various http header fields. We also study influence of application of the new anonymization methodology on percentage of attacks detectable by an IDS. Experimental results show that a great number of the attacks present in the input data without anonymization are still detectable by the tested IDS even after the application of the strongest anonymization scheme defined by our methodology. Although the new anonymization method focuses on application data, it could also be used in the link, network, and transport protocol contexts","","0-7695-2775-2","","10.1109/ARES.2007.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4159827","","Benchmark testing;Data privacy;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Transport protocols","benchmark testing;computer networks;data handling;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IDS benchmarking;IDS testing;artificially generated network traffic sources;data anonymization;informational object categorization;sensitive information;transport protocol","","2","","13","","","10-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to having privileged access to organization resources and information, these users may be familiar with the defenses surrounding valuable assets. Computers systems at the organization need a mechanism for communicating suspicious activity that is difficult for a malicious insider (or even an outsider) to detect or block. In this work, we propose a covert channel in the Ethernet frame that allows a computer system to report activity inside other, unrelated network communication. The covert channel leverages the differences in the framing approaches used by Ethernet and IP packets to append hidden information to IP packet and transmit it to an organization's administrator. This stealthy communication is difficult for even advanced attackers and is challenging to block since it opportunistically uses unrelated communication. Further, since the transmission is tied to the Ethernet frame, the communication cannot traverse network routers, preventing security information from leaving the organization. We introduce the covert channel, incorporate it into a working prototype, and combine it with an intrusion detection system to show its promise for security event reporting.","","978-1-4799-0458-7","","10.1109/SPW.2013.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565231","Covert Channels;Insider Threats;Network Security","IP networks;Monitoring;Operating systems;Organizations;Payloads;Protocols;Security","computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication network routing","Ethernet frame;IP packets;computer system;covert channels;insider threats;intrusion detection system;network communication;network routers;organization resources;security event reporting;security information;stealthy communication;suspicious activity;trusted insiders","","0","","26","","","23-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their main drawback is that they are more exposed to cyber-attack as data packets have to be relayed on a hop-by-hop basis. This paper presents a dynamically updating key distribution strategy, together with a message protection scheme in support of 4-way handshaking. For the 4-way handshaking, we propose a hash based encryption scheme to secure the unprotected message exchanges during the handshaking process. This is aimed at improving the resiliency of the network in the situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack. We then evaluate the security of the proposed scheme against cyber-attack, as well as network performance in terms of delay and overhead.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831169","EMSA;IEEE 802.11s;SAE;Smart Grid;security attacks;security protocols;wireless mesh networks","Authentication;Computer crime;Delays;Logic gates;Mesh networks;Microwave integrated circuits","computer network security;cryptography;real-time systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","4-way handshaking protection;HAN;NAN;cyber attack;data packets;denial of service attack;hash based encryption;home area networks;hop-by-hop basis;installation;key distribution;message protection;neighborhood area networks;real-time control;real-time monitoring;scalability;self-configuration;self-healing;smart grid;substation-plant-generation;wireless mesh network security;wireless mesh-sensor networks","","1","","20","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data. Our experiment demonstrates that, although the false rate of integrated decision system is not the best of the four approaches discussed, the false rate is so low, its positive rate is the best one of these four, and its training time and decision time is so short that our approach is feasible for online.","","978-0-7695-3843-3","978-1-4244-5068-8","10.1109/MINES.2009.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371022","The proximal SVM;integrated;intrusion detection;system","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Filters;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Protection;Testing","security of data;support vector machines","data callback phase;data preprocessing phase;fusion decision phase;integrated decision system;intrusion detection","","0","","9","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality. The experimental results show that by combining our defined ROC curve-based measure, namely relative expected cost, our developed filter can achieve a better outcome in the aspect of cost consideration.","2159-1547","978-1-4577-1778-9","","10.1109/CIMSA.2012.6269608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269608","Computational Intelligence;False Alarm Reduction;Intelligent Decision Support and Control Systems;Intrusion detection;Performance Measurement","Algorithm design and analysis;Equations;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Support vector machines","alarm systems;computer network security;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation","NIDS;ROC curve-based measure;cost analysis;decision quality;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network attacks;network environment;network intrusion detection system;single-algorithm performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","2-4 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the best first and genetic algorithm search strategies by removing much more redundant features and still keeping the classification accuracies or even getting better performances.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438117","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0-1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming","Classification algorithms;Computer vision;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Integer linear programming;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Machine learning;Polynomials;Testing","Bayes methods;correlation theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;security of data;tree searching","Bayesnet machines;IDS;best-first-CFS;branch-and-bound algorithm;classification accuracy;correlation feature selection;expert knowledge;feature selection algorithm;filter method;fractional programming problem;genetic algorithm;improving effectiveness;intrusion detection systems;linear programming problem;machine learning;optimization problem;redundant features;traffic features","","8","","16","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate mine detection in such application is very important otherwise it may lead to loss of life. Prompted by this we propose an adaptive sensor placement algorithm where sensor placement is dynamically determined based on existing mine concentration in a given area thus ensuring that sensors are localized in the region of higher mine concentration. We further use clustering algorithm for data aggregation from sensor nodes reported from high mine density region; this ensures optimum utilization of sensor batteries which is one of the major determinants in sensor lifetime and hence system reliability.

The proposed framework calculates a node's trust value based on observations from neighbour nodes by using Grey theory and Fuzzy sets. The TMF chooses multiple rather than a single parameter to obtain trust values. Simulations conducted in a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET, 802.11-based) with Random Waypoint Mobility Mode show what the proposed framework can do is not only detecting abnormal trust behaviour, but also discovering which parameter for forming trust values of a mobile node is abnormal, that means it can identify the possible attack strategy in both static and mobile environment. The TMF has shown good performance in calculating trust values of mobile wireless nodes under normal and abnormal (attack) conditions, and hence can be considered as an effective trust framework for MANETs.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120813","Fuzzy Se;Grey theory;MANET;Random Waypoint;trust management framework","Indexes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Wireless networks","fuzzy set theory;grey systems;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","MANET;TMF;fuzzy set theory;grey theory;malicious behaviour detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile wireless nodes;random waypoint mobility mode;selfish behaviour detection;trust management framework;wireless network security","","1","","16","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A security service engine (SSE) with packet deep inspection ability is also designed to accompany with manageable L2 switches. By properly configuring the VLAN parameters, packets from switch ports of the L2 switch are forwarded to the SSE, via the gigabit Ethernet interface, for deeply inspection. For security reason, abnormal/malicious packets are dropped by the SSE directly while normal packets are forwarded back to the switch to the correct output port. To evaluate the performance and latency of the proposed architecture, a cost effective P4-based SSE is also implemented as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IPS) with layer-7 content inspection function. The obtained measurements show that the proposed architecture is practical with high throughput and low latency. With IPC-based SSE implementation, the traditional L2 switches can now provide content security service in a very cost effective way.","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577789","","Cost function;Delay;Engines;Ethernet networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Packet switching;Security;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","local area networks;packet switching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","gigabit Ethernet interface;intrusion detection and prevention system;network security switch architecture;packet deep inspection;security service engine","","1","","10","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.","","978-0-7695-3347-6","","10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314","Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","Internet;information retrieval;security of data","Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet","","3","","33","","","21-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the research compared the processing speed of these approaches with generic hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in Matlab and compared the accuracy of the clusters with the clusters created by human raters. The results show that both of the proposed approaches are more efficient and accurate than the generic hierarchical clustering algorithm. The proposed methodology can be implemented as an add-on to existing learning management systems and e-book readers, to automatically offer the students important notes and annotations conducted by others (either peers or students in the past) who have similar annotation behaviour pattern and style to the students.","","978-1-4673-2173-0","","10.1109/T4E.2012.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305938","Annotation;Biology-inspired;Chromosome;Clustering;Patterns","Benchmark testing;Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Educational institutions;Humans;Standards","computer aided instruction;pattern clustering;text analysis","annotation behaviour pattern;biology-inspired approach;digital text annotation;e-book reader;learning management system;student annotation;student clustering","","0","","25","","","18-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Algorithms for detecting intrusions are under rapid development, but far from being mature. One interesting and difficult issue is how to study and test a new intrusion detection algorithm against a variety of (perhaps simulated) intrusive activities under realistic background traffic. A flexible and general-purpose platform for testing intrusion detection algorithms is clearly desirable. This paper presents such a software platform, called IntruDetector. With this platform, detection algorithms can be tested directly in a real environment with a wide range of intrusive activities. The data of normal system activities are directly collected from the live environment, and are mixed with intrusive activities that are simulated by hybrid simulation. The main properties of this approach are: (1) the background traffic is realistic; (2) it allows flexible simulation of various types of intrusions; and (3) normal system operation will not be disrupted by virtually simulated destructive intrusions during testing.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991516","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data security;Detection algorithms;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Software algorithms;Software testing;System testing;Traffic control","authorisation;hybrid simulation;program testing","IDS;IntruDetector;algorithm testing;flexible simulation;hybrid simulation;information infrastructure;intrusion detection system;monitoring;network intrusion detection;realistic background traffic;security information;software platform","","1","","24","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the socket level traffic fingerprinting helps our frame work to achieve a finer granularity on rogue AP detection among the existing schemes. This framework has the following nice properties: i) it requires neither specialized hardware nor modification to existing standards; ii) the proposed mechanism greatly improves the rogue AP detection probability so that network resilience is improved; iii) it provides a cost-effective solution to Wi-Fi network security enhancement by incorporating free but mature software tools; iv) it can protect the network from adversaries capable of using customized equipment and/or violating the IEEE 802.11 standard; v) its open architecture allows extra features to be easily added on in the future.

However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational ""real world"" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.","1081-6011","978-1-4244-6894-2","978-1-4244-6895-9","10.1109/SP.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5504793","anomaly detection;intrusion detection;machine learning;network security","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;National security;Privacy;Telecommunication traffic","","","","59","","66","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Quality of Protection (QoP) estimates the stability of individual network system by quantifying security intensity. So, it can work as an evaluation standard for the security of network. This paper considers Historical Vulnerability Measure (HVM) and relative weight in total reward function for the improved QoP model.

To achieve such flexibility, programmable packet processors have replaced traditional fixed-function custom logic in the data path of routers. This programmability introduces new vulnerabilities in these systems that can lead to new types of network attacks. We propose a monitoring subsystem which functions in parallel with the processing core of the router and aids in the detection of such attacks. Upon detection, our system has the ability to restore the router's operation to a different, but functionally equivalent state.","","978-1-4799-7542-6","","10.1109/ICCE.2015.7066397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066397","","Conferences;Hardware;Monitoring;Process control;Program processors;Protocols","multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip;telecommunication security","adaptive security mechanism;fixed-function custom logic;modern routers;monitoring subsystem;processing core;programmable packet processors","","0","","17","","","9-12 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A comparison of system call feature representations for insider threat detection","Liu, A.; Martin, C.; Hetherington, T.; Matzner, S.","Signal & Inf. Sci.

Proceedings from the Sixth Annual IEEE SMC","20050815","2005","","","340","347","This paper investigates anomaly detection techniques that have been successful for detecting external threats and applies them to the insider threat problem. The ""insider threat"" involves the actions of a trusted and privileged user who is inappropriately accessing or disseminating sensitive information or otherwise compromising information systems. In contrast, the ""external threat"" involves the actions of an outsider attempting to compromise or gain access to the information systems. Although approaches for automatically detecting external threat instances have been quite successful (i.e., intrusion detection systems), there is very little similar work for the insider threat. In the past, anomaly detection systems have proven useful for detecting external threat. Anomaly detection at the system call level offers a high degree of information assurance in terms of tamper-resistance and system activity coverage. Therefore, we investigate three system-call-based feature representations: n-grams of system call names, histograms of system call names, and individual system calls with associated parameters. We find that none of these representations consistently performs as well when dealing with the internal threat as previous results show for external threat detection. However, parameter-based features for certain system calls do show some sensitivity to detecting the insider threat, and we plan to explore and enhance this sensitivity in future work.","","0-7803-9290-6","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495972","","Business;Computer vision;Data security;Government;Histograms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Operating systems;Testing","information systems;security of data","anomaly detection system;external threat detection;histograms;information access;information assurance;information dissemination;information systems;insider threat detection;intrusion detection system;outlier detection;sensitive information;system call feature representation;system call names;tamper resistance;trust;user privilege","","12","","18","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classical approaches--knowledge and signature based, respectively--for attack detection either produce high false positive detection rates or fails to detect attack variations, leading to 0-day attacks. To counter this trend, an ontology can help build a strategy-based knowledge attack database. A novel hybrid attack detection engine brings together the main advantages of knowledge- and signature-based classical approaches. Moreover, it is capable of mitigating 0-day attacks for XML injection, with no false positive detection rates.","1540-7993","","","10.1109/MSP.2012.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6216348","0-day attack;Web services;XML injection;intrusion detection system;ontology;zero-day","Computer security;Databases;Intrusion detection;Ontologies;Security;Web services;XML","Web services;XML;database management systems;digital signatures;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","Web services;XML injection 0-day attack mitigation;attack detection;hybrid attack detection engine;knowledge classical approach;ontology;signature based classical approach;strategy-based detection system;strategy-based knowledge attack database","","1","","","","2012-06-12","July-Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since profiling complex sequential data is still an open problem in anomaly detection, there is a need to explore new approaches. While previous research has used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for anomaly-based intrusion detection, the proposed models tend to increase rapidly in complexity in order to increase the detection rate while reducing the false detections. In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM). Our process trace clustering approach using HMMs for system call anomaly detection provides accurate results and reduces the complexity required to detect anomalies. In this paper, we show how system call traces processed with our HMM method can provide a path forward to improved intrusion detection techniques.","","","","10.1109/SERE-C.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901637","Anomaly detection;HMMs;system call traces","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training","hidden Markov models;pattern clustering;security of data","anomalous behavior detection;anomaly-based intrusion detection;clustering approach;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection techniques;multi-HMM approach;system call anomaly detection","","0","","26","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
