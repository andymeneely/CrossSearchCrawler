"Collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS): a framework for accurate and efficient IDS","Yu-Sung Wu; Foo, Bingrui; Yongguo Mei; Bagchi, S.","Sch. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2003. Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work looks at the issue of under what conditions time correlation is a sufficient approach to this problem in the sense that it does not introduce erroneous alert dusters. A formal framework for signature-based IDS event detection is developed to aid this discussion. Through this framework it is shown that, even for the simplest case of a single isolated attack, time correlation is not a sufficient approach for noncoincidently located heterogeneous sensors due to the nondeterministic nature of network propagation delays. An approach is then discussed to include additional information about the knowledge domains of the respective IDS sensors, at a per trigger level, to improve the correlation accuracy.","","0-7803-7978-0","","10.1109/PACRIM.2003.1235911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1235911","","Clocks;Computer networks;Failure analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Observability;Payloads;Propagation delay;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","handwriting recognition;safety systems;sensors;telecommunication security","correlation accuracy improvement;data volume overwhelming;event detection;heterogeneous IDS system;heterogeneous sensor;intrusion detection system;network propagation delay;signature-based IDS alert;time-based correlation","","0","","7","","","28-30 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a framework for key management that provides redundancy and robustness for security association (SA) establishment between pairs of nodes in mobile ad hoc networks. Our KMS uses a modified hierarchical trust public key infrastructure (PKI) model in which nodes can dynamically assume management roles. The system ensures high service availability for the network members through a number of schemes. A novel behavior grading mechanism provides security criteria for the network nodes and aids the management functions of the KMS to revoke or reissue certificates for nodes. This mechanism is based on the notion of trust, and more specifically on SAs among nodes in the entire network. In this paper we give an overview of the framework of the system and present a performance analysis of the system based on certificate issuance and acquisition. Finally, we compare our KMS with threshold cryptography schemes.","","0-7695-2315-3","","10.1109/ITCC.2005.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425204","","Availability;Communication system security;Data security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance analysis;Public key;Public key cryptography;Redundancy;Robustness","ad hoc networks;computer network management;mobile computing;public key cryptography","key management system;mobile ad hoc network;public key infrastructure;security association establishment;service availability;threshold cryptography","","7","2","11","","","4-6 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with the advent of collaborative computing and data sharing, more and more new modes of interaction have evolved resulting in the need and use of distributed resources. Work within this community has led to the development of Grid technologies, which address precisely these problems. In grid computing, heterogeneous resources distributed geographically are virtualized as a unified whole. Grid computing, as a result, provides enormous opportunities in terms of resource sharing, maximization of resource utilization and virtualization of resources. Because of its immense potential, not only the scientific community, but also the IT enterprise communities are excited about its prospect. A recent survey ranked grid computing as sixth on priority lists for IT spending among industry professionals. With this much interest, security becomes necessary to provide authentication, authorization, resource protection, secure communication, data confidentiality, data integrity, trust policies management, user key and credential management, service protection, and network security. This paper provides an insight classification of the different mechanisms and methods of security in grid computing environment, and also discusses the solutions for each category and its limitation in order to define the real problems in grid computing security.

Experimental results have shown that the PCC lightweight anomaly detection classifier outperforms other existing anomaly detection algorithms such as the KNN and LOF classifiers. In order to assess the performance of the PCC classifier on a real network environment, the relative assumption model together with feature extraction techniques are used to generate normal and anomalous traffic in a LAN testbed. Finally, scalability and response performance of the proposed system are investigated through the simulation of the proposed communication architecture. The simulation results demonstrate a satisfactory linear relationship between the degradation of response performance and the scalability of the system","","0-7695-2553-9","","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636211","","Degradation;Design methodology;Detection algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","feature extraction;local area networks;pattern classification;principal component analysis;real-time systems;security of data;software agents;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","IDS;LAN testbed;PCC;anomaly detection algorithm;communication architecture;distributed agent-based approach;feature extraction technique;intrusion detection system;local area network;network traffic;principal component classifier;real network environment;scalability","","3","","22","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the Internet becomes more open to public, most people and organizations prefer to use online services. At the same time, the Internet security problem is becoming more severe. An effective and feasible protection measure for network security is necessary. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a typical measure used to provide protection for information systems. In order to detect unknown attacks, anomaly detection technique is a commonly used method. Meanwhile, many scholars are studying more effective and easy-to-use anomaly detection methods. In this paper, a new intrusion detection approach inspired by the function of biological memory cell is proposed. The detectors in this approach (which called memory detector) are more effective than common detectors. The generation method of memory detector is detailed. In order to analyze and evaluate the performance of this approach, comparative experiments are implemented with training and testing data from “Knowledge Discovery and Data mining cup 1999” (KDD99) dataset.

WSN is very sensitive to various attacks, hence Security has become prominent issue in WSNs. Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attack is one of main concern for WSNs. DOS Attack diminishes the resources of sensor nodes which affect the normal functioning of the node. Media Access Control (MAC) layer is responsible for communication within multiple access networks and incorporates shared medium. Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media Access Control (FSMAC) Protocol gives good solution against DOS Attack. It detects all intrusion taking place and also decreases average energy consumed by the sensor network than in attacked scenario. These results are responsible for increase in the lifespan of a sensor network. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty for human reasoning and decision making. Innovational use of Fuzzy logic theory is applied to this FSMAC protocol to enhance the performance. Here in this paper, Reinvention in FSMAC protocol is proposed using new intrusion detector parameters like No of times node sensed channel free and Variation in channel sense period. Performance of new protocol is tested on the basis of time of first node dead and average energy consumed by the sensor node.

One of the biggest trends has been social media services such as Facebook and Twitter. Although social media is the major trend, it is not the only one. Cloud computing has made a large impact on the computing industry in recent years. Whether being utilized to provide highly scalable robust environments for applications or just being used as a marketing ploy, one thing is certain: cloud computing has the potential to yet again change the way we interact with computer systems. There is just one major factor separating cloud computing from becoming widely accepted both personally and commercially and that is security. As cloud systems re-innovate ways of request distribution and load balancing, it is important to test these systems against attacks such as the denial of service attack. There is a strong emphasis on researching these attacks since cloud computing is re-inventing the payment systems in which consumers utilize resources. This paper examines the Google App Engine and its resilience to denial of service attacks. Further the paper demonstrates the strain such an attack has on the servers that facilitate the services and finally discuss the preventative measures set in place by Google and how they are only temporary solutions.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2015.7069370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069370","Cloud Computing;Cloud Computing Security;Denial of Service;Google App Engine;Network Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Databases;Engines;Google;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;social networking (online)","Facebook;Google App Engine;Internet;Twitter;cloud computing;denial of service attacks;load balancing;request distribution;social media services","","0","","8","","","16-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With an attractive relative low cost, demand for video analytics has focused on high probability of detection and low nuisance alarm rate that has prioritized investment toward performance improvements. Modern algorithms offer sophisticated video-based intrusion detection and tracking capabilities that were unavailable a decade earlier. The modern video analytics have been shown to have a significant reduction of previously observed high nuisance alarm rates with improved detection capabilities. This paper includes results of a recent device evaluation performed at Sandia National Laboratories for a representative exterior intrusion detection application. For this limited scope effort, the device was evaluated for probability of detection and monitored for nuisance and false alarms over a six-month period from September 2010 to April 2011 (nuisance alarm cause is detailed). This paper also includes general and specific implementation considerations for video analytics. The author asserts that this work holds potential to improve implementation strategies for video-based detection sensors for several types of exterior perimeter and extended detection-sensing applications, making the case for interoperation and compliance standardization between video and sensor technology vendors for simplified integration of video analytic algorithms into security platforms.","1071-6572","978-1-4673-2450-2","978-1-4673-2449-6","10.1109/CCST.2012.6393585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393585","","Cameras;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Lighting;Performance evaluation;Sensor systems","image sensors;object detection;probability;security of data;target tracking;video signal processing","compatible assessment system;extended detection-sensing applications;exterior intrusion detection applications;high probability of detection;low nuisance alarm rate;prioritized investment;security platforms;target-tracking capability;video analytic devices;video analytics assessment algorithm;video-based detection sensor strategy;video-based intrusion detection;video-based tracking capability","","0","","4","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The knowledge-based part of the authentication procedure will include a real-time question and answer session before the users are allowed to proceed to the second stage and identify the correct images from a number of challenge-sets presented to them. The proposed ID algorithm will employ a statistical data classification technique based on the real-time tracking of the user behavior. Two statistical algorithms are proposed for the implementation of these additional features of the system. Importance sampling technique will be employed to select the attributes for the knowledge-based authentication stage while the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm will form the basis of the intrusion detection part of the system. The paper outlines some issues that need to be resolved before proceeding with the implementation of the additional system features and lists some contributions and insights that might be gained from this work.

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed. The design is hardware based and suitable for networking and security querying applications.","","","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926138","Bloom filter;H3 hash function;compactness;counting bloom filter;cryptographic hash function field programmable array;false positive ratio;membership querying;parallel bloom Filter;standard bloom Filter;whirlpool hash function","Arrays;Cryptography;Hardware;Information filters;Radiation detectors;Standards","cryptography;data structures;dictionaries;field programmable gate arrays","Xilinx;arbitrary length;bloom filter variants;bloom filters;cryptographic hash function whirlpool;data structure technique;dynamic membership querying;false positive ratios;field programmable gate array;fixed-length output;hash based structures;information compaction;intelligent dictionary;mapping scheme;network security;networking application;noncryptographic form;performance matrix;security application;spell check application;target technology;universal H3 hash function;whirlpool hash based bloom filter","","0","","30","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on compressed HTTP traffic. HTTP uses GZIP compression and requires some kind of decompression phase before performing a string matching. We present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP (ACCH), that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern-matching algorithm. By analyzing real HTTP traffic and real Web application firewall signatures, we show that up to 84% of the data can be skipped in its scan. Surprisingly, we show that it is faster to perform pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than on regular traffic. As far as we know, we are the first paper that analyzes the problem of “on-the-fly” multipattern matching on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2172456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062397","Compressed HTTP;computer security;intrusion detection;pattern matching","Acceleration;Browsers;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;authorisation;computer network security;data compression;hypermedia;string matching;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH;Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP;GZIP compression;compressed HTTP traffic;data compression;decompression phase;market-share;multipattern matching acceleration;pattern matching;real Web application firewall signatures;security tools;signature-based detection;string matching","","3","","34","","2011-10-27","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE","20080502","2008","","","","","Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters. A single architecture is memory efficient for large pattern set, and it is possible to support more than 10 M patterns with at most half amount of the memory utilization compared to the state-of-the-art architectures.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509637","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Communications Society;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching","cache storage;computer networks;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;telecommunication security","ACC algorithm;cached deterministic finite automate;computer network security;content inspection based application;memory efficient multiple pattern matching architecture;next-state addressing scheme","","21","3","23","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a series of exploits constitutes an attack path and the set of all possible attack paths form an attack graph. Present day vulnerability scanners are able to identify the vulnerabilities in isolation but there is a need for correlation among these vulnerabilities to identify overall risk of the network. In this paper we propose a novel approach by finding out an attack path consisting of logically connected exploits and extends it to an attack graph.

The new classification method utilizes the average distances of the new data to its closest neighbor points to classify it as normal or intrusion. Then, the distances of the data to the centroids of normal, misuse intrusion and anomaly intrusion is used to get the accurate class label of the data. In addition, this paper integrates Fuzzy GNP-based class association rule mining method to extract rules. Fuzzy GNP avoids the use of the domain knowledge and solves the continuous attributes efficiently.

This opening, a prior beneficial, nevertheless raises a major problem: it ensues from it an increasing number of attacks. The IDS was developed with the aim of detecting abnormal functioning of information systems and networks, indicating that actions not corresponding to the safety policy are led by one or several users. Centralized IDS suffer from significant limitations when used in high speed networks, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper we propose a distributed hybrid approach based on mobile agents for the detection of intrusion: HAMA-IDS (Hybrid Approach based on Mobile Agents for Intrusion Detection System). The proposed approach uses the platform Aglets for the creation and the distribution of four types of mobile agents. The Collector agent is used to the gathering of information, when the Analyzer and Redirector agent are responsible of the analysis (scenarios and behavioral analysis). The generator agent is responsible to the launch of these agents and to the management of messages received from these last ones.","","978-1-4673-2226-3","","10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360647","Aglets;Mobile Agents;hybrid approach;intrusion detection system","Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Java;Mobile agents;Pattern matching","Internet;information systems;mobile agents;security of data","HAMA-IDS;Internet;aglets;analyzer agent;centralized IDS;collector agent;distributed attacks;distributed hybrid approach;generator agent;high speed networks;hybrid approach based on mobile agents for intrusion detection system;information systems;mobile agents;redirector agent;safety policy","","1","","16","","","1-3 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An appropriate intrusion detection system is an inevitable requirement. Using anomaly based intrusion detection system results in the false positive identification of the intrusion. Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed.

However, existing intrusion detection techniques will be likely to face challenges when deployed on the cloud platform. The pre-determined IDS architecture may lead to overloading of a part of the cloud due to the extra detection overhead. This paper proposes a neural network based IDS which is a distributed system with an adaptive architecture so as to make full use of the available resources without overloading any single machine in the cloud. Moreover, with the machine learning ability from the neural network, the proposed IDS can detect new types of attacks with fairly accurate results.

It is an obstracle that node has limited supplication of energy which limites developments of WSN. To tackle the strict limitation of energy supplication in large scale WSN, hierarchical structure of WSN is proposed by seperating WSN into many jointed cluster with a Cluster Head (CH) in each clusters. Hierarchical structure is a useful mechanism used to prolong lifetime of WSN. It is a critical problem that how many clusters should be separated. Suitable cluster number will prolong the lifetime of WSN and reduce energy dissipated in Cluster Head (CH) selection per round. Considering the character of communication scope of node in cluster, there exist areas of redundant place between jointed clusters. To give a precise number of CH, we use efficient coverage instead of full coverage of cluster to calculate the optimal number of CH per round, according to characters of one and two order partial derivative functions.","","978-1-4244-6347-3","","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5485885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5485885","cluster;coverage;hierarchical structure","Bridges;Cities and towns;Distributed amplifiers;Distributed computing;Energy dissipation;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Physics;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor networks","WSN lifetime;cluster head;energy dissipation;energy supplication limitation;hierarchical structure;partial derivative functions;wireless sensor network","","0","","11","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each regular expression (regex) is first parsed into a concise token list representation, then compiled to a modular nondeterministic finite automaton (RE-NFA) using a modified version of the McNaughton-Yamada algorithm. The RE-NFA can be mapped directly onto a compact register-transistor level (RTL) circuit. A number of optimizations are applied to improve the circuit performance: 1) spatial stacking is used to construct an REM circuit processing m ≥ 1 input characters per clock cycle; 2) single-character constrained repetitions are matched efficiently by parallel shift-register lookup tables; 3) complex character classes are matched by a BRAM-based classifier shared across regexes; 4) a multipipeline architecture is used to organize a large number of RE-NFAs into priority groups to limit the I/O size of the circuit. We implemented 2,630 unique PCRE regexes from Snort rules (February 2010) in the proposed REM architecture.

The pulses are transmitted off-chip by the address event representation (AER) protocol, i.e. via a digital bus as the identifying address of the sending pixel. For the motion pixels, this read-out strategy has the advantage of low latency in the order of 100 ns after a change is encountered. (Whereas a scanning read-out strategy would on average suffer a delay of half of the frame scanning period.) Mounted on a pan-tilt system, the peripheral motion detectors could, for instance, be used to steer the imager such that the image of a moving object falls onto the central pixel array where it can then be examined in detail at a higher resolution.

Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-dimensional Clustering method for Short-time scale Traffic(MCST) to classify abnormal and normal traffic.

Inspired by the game theory, in this research work, we model the interactions between the attacker and the adaptation manager as a two-player zero-sum Markov game. Using this game-theoretic approach, the adaptation manager can refine its strategies in dynamic attack scenarios by utilizing what has learned from the system's and adversary's actions. We also present how this approach can be fitted to the well-known MAPE-K architecture model.

In this paper, we proposed an anomaly intrusion detection model based on small labeled instances that outperform existing unsupervised methods with a detection performance very close to that of the supervised one. We evaluated our methods by conducting experiments with network records from the KDD CUP 1999 data set. The results showed that our algorithm is an efficient method in detecting both known and unknown attacks.","","978-0-7695-3258-5","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606072","Intrusion detection;density-based clustering algorithm;k-means","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Computer security;Context modeling;Costs;Electronic commerce;Information processing;Internet;Intrusion detection;Shape","security of data","KDD CUP 1999 data set;anomaly intrusion detection model;network intrusion detection system","","0","","8","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Attack graph is commonly used for analyzing network security level for its capability in reflecting all network vulnerabilities and their inter relationships. However, attack graph assumes an over pessimistic situation by giving the attacker unlimited power of exploiting each chain of vulnerabilities in the network, leading the complexity of analyzing to grow exponentially with the size of network. Therefore, the weakest paths suggested by such analysis could be inaccurate for adversary with limited computation power. In this paper, we investigate how attackers are planning to exploit vulnerabilities towards their targets and present the idea of a goal-oriented analysis of attack graph to address this problem.

In a first attempt to address the aforementioned issues, in this paper we propose a solution for the detection of multistage, distributed attacks based on the creation of security oriented Web Services.

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors. A set of simulations is conducted for validating the feasibility and evaluating the performance of our proposed framework.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199233","","Autonomous agents;Communications Society;Cost function;Event detection;Humans;Impedance;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Optimization methods","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","ADRS sensor;MANET;accidental system errors;anomalous events;autonomous agent;cost-sensitive anomaly detection;decision-theoretical framework;detection accuracy;detection cost;detection performance;false positive rate;intentional attacks;key evaluation metrics;mobile ad hoc networks;operational cost;policy gradient algorithms;response cost;response system","","0","","14","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization approach based on the behavioral study of animals/birds that outperforms GA in some applications. Therefore, the PSO based method is proposed in feature subset selection in this research work.","","978-1-4799-4420-0","","10.1109/ITAIC.2014.7065007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065007","Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm (GA);Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO);Subset","Computers;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature selection;genetic algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data","GA;PCA;PSO;computer systems;discriminative subset;eigenspace;eigenvalues;false alarms;feature subset selection;genetic algorithm;network systems;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;principal component analysis;robust intrusion detection system","","0","","20","","","20-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Non-cooperative game theory is used to formally express the problem, where the two players are: (1) the intruders and (2) the intrusion detection system.

IEEE","20081208","2008","","","1","5","Power saving is a critical issue in wireless ad hoc networks. Many of the existing energy efficient routing protocols utilize the power management feature provided by MAC layer (e.g. IEEE 802.11 PSM). The rationale behind these protocols is to power down (put in sleep) the redundant nodes that do not involve in the packets routing. To keep a low end-to-end latency and preserve the routing fidelity, a group of nodes are selected to constitute a virtual backbone throughout the network. The backbone nodes do not sleep all the time serving for the packets routing while the rest of nodes turn to sleep mode if there is no packet to send or receive. Backbone nodes are periodically selected and replaced; the current selection and replacement mechanism mainly concerns the energy balance and fairness among the network nodes while the security threat is not considered. In this paper, we present that the adversary may launch security attacks against the network by exploiting the vulnerabilities of the backbone node selection algorithm. To address this problem, we propose a biased random selection algorithm to prevent the security attacks. The evaluation results indicate that with the aid of reputation system, the proposed biased random selection scheme is more secure than the random selection scheme while trading for a limited amount of power efficiency.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.385","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698160","","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Computer science;Delay;Energy management;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power system management;Protocols;Routing;Spine","access protocols;ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MAC layer;biased random selection algorithm;energy efficient routing protocol;power saving;secure virtual backbone-based power management;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","14","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 18th Annual","20030206","2002","","","185","195","Penetration testing is the art of finding an open door. It is not a science as science depends on falsifiable hypotheses. The most penetration testing can hope for is to be the science of insecurity - not the science of security nasmuch as penetration testing can at most prove insecurity by falsifying the hypothesis that any system, network, or application is secure. To be a science of security would require falsifiable hypotheses that any given system, network, or application was insecure, something that could only be done if the number of potential insecurities were known and enumerated such that the penetration tester could thereby falsify (test) a known-to-be-complete list of vulnerabilities claimed to not be present. Because the list of potential insecurities is unknowable and hence unenumerable, no penetration tester can prove security, just as no doctor can prove that you are without occult disease. Putting it as Picasso did, ""Art is a lie that shows the truth"" and security by penetration testing is a lie in that on a good day can show the truth. These incompleteness and proof-by-demonstration characteristics of penetration testing ensure that it remains an art so long as high rates of technical advance remains brisk and hence enumeration of vulnerabilities an impossibility. Brisk technical advance equals productivity growth and thereby wealth creation, so it is forbidden to long for a day when penetration testing could achieve the status of science.","1063-9527","0-7695-1828-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176290","","Art;Automation;Diseases;Fires;Performance evaluation;Productivity;Security;System testing;Terminology","computer testing;security of data","falsifiable hypotheses;insecurity;penetration testing;potential insecurities;security;vulnerabilities","","9","","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Protocol scrubbers are transparent, active interposition mechanisms for explicitly removing network scans and attacks at various protocol layers. The transport scrubber supports downstream passive network-based intrusion detection systems by converting ambiguous network flows into well-behaved flows that are unequivocally interpreted by all downstream end-points. The fingerprint scrubber restricts an attacker's ability to determine the operating system of a protected host. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks - attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection - on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance. The TCP scrubber is based on a novel, simplified state machine that performs in a fast and scalable manner. The fingerprint scrubber is built upon the TCP scrubber and removes additional ambiguities from flows that can reveal implementation-specific details about a host's operating system","","0-7695-1212-7","","10.1109/DISCEX.2001.932163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932163","","Banking;Business;Computer security;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Protection;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","network operating systems;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP scrubber;ambiguities;ambiguous network flows;detection subversion;downstream passive network-based intrusion detection systems;evasion attacks;fingerprint scrubber;host operating system determination;implementation-specific details;insertion attacks;network attacks;network scans;network security;passive network-based intrusion detection systems;performance;protected host;protocol scrubbers;state machine;transparent active interposition mechanisms;transparent flow modification;transport scrubber","","4","1","25","","","2001","12 Jun 2001-14 Jun 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Presence of such nodes results in congestion in paths, unreliable packet delivery and erroneous data outputs for wireless sensor networks. Existing literatures have addressed this problem using protocols with mechanisms to detect the presence of these misbehaving nodes and ignoring them altogether while delivering a packet. However, design and deployments costs are on the higher side for sensor nodes and ignoring a node entirely blocks a relay node for multiple paths passing through it resulting in inefficient use of resources. In this paper we introduce a protocol named as MMP (Misbehavior Management Protocol) to differentiate between a black hole node and a selective forwarding node. By differentiating between these two types of misbehaving nodes, paths can be chosen intelligently for the packets which might be blocked or might be allowed to pass through a node. Hence our protocol presents a misbehaving selective forwarding node as an operational node to sensors nodes whose packets are not being blocked by the node. This allows higher throughput, multiple options for selecting paths as well as more accurate data collection from the sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks.","2153-1676","","","10.1109/ANTS.2013.6802887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802887","Blackholes;Misbehaving nodes;Selective forwarding nodes;Wireless sensor networks","Base stations;Protocols;Relays;Reliability;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication congestion control;wireless sensor networks","MMP;ad hoc networks;black hole node;intelligent management;misbehaving nodes;misbehavior management protocol;operational node;protocols;relay node;selective forwarding node;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","0","","22","","","15-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is important for the DBMS to have an idea of who exactly has access to data. Much research on mitigating insider threats focuses on detection. In this paper, we consider the prevention of attacks using access control and we propose (RBAC<sup>+</sup>), an extension of the NIST RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) standard with the notions of application, application profile and sub-application session.

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).","","978-1-4244-2777-2","978-1-4244-2778-9","10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093","","Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system","","19","1","28","","","14-16 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the growing reliance on encryption technology, less and less payload data is available for analysis. In order to accomplish intrusion detection in an encrypted environment, a new data representation must emerge. We present a knowledge engineering approach to allow intrusion detection in an encrypted environment. Our approach relies on gathering and analyzing several forms of metadata relating to session activity of the principals involved and the protocols that they employ.

CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques.

At the network layer, most IP-based ad hoc routing protocols can be accommodated. At the transport layer, the transport manager is instructed by the interface manager to adapt the transmission rate according to the new wireless link. Finally, at the application layer, the security manager handles various aspects of security concerns. Simulation results show that our approach can deliver low packet loss, low latency, and smooth handoff solutions with minimum packet overhead.

The increasing need for correlating information across distributed systems to better detect potential attacks and to meet regulatory requirements can potentially exacerbate the problem if the monitoring is centralized. A single zero-day vulnerability would permit an attacker to access all information. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for performing policy-based security monitoring. We use policies to distribute information across several hosts, so that any host compromise has limited impact on the confidentiality of the data about the overall system. Experiments show that our solution spreads information uniformly across distributed monitoring hosts and forces attackers to perform multiple actions to acquire important data.","1530-0889","978-1-4673-1624-8","978-1-4673-1623-1","10.1109/DSN.2012.6263954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263954","confidentiality;distributed systems;monitoring;policy compliance;security","Computers;Correlation;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers;Software","distributed processing;security of data","application logs;configuration data;distributed systems;event data confidentiality;policy-based security monitoring;potential attack detection;single zero-day vulnerability;topology information","","0","","29","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a type of SOM - Quantum Growing Hierarchical Self Organized Map (QGHSOM) are made in order to improve the stability of intrusion detection and increase detection rate. The training process of QGHSOM networks can be described in terms of input pattern presentation and quantum states of weight update by quantum rotation gates. The QGHSOM is implemented and applied to the intrusion detection. The validities and feasibilities of the QGHSOM are confirmed through experiments on KDD Cup 99 datasets.

"Bayesian Model Averaging of Bayesian Network Classifiers for Intrusion Detection","Liyuan Xiao; Yetian Chen; Chang, C.K.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Iowa State Univ.

However, existing BN classifiers for intrusion detection suffer two problems. First, such BN classifiers are often trained from data using heuristic methods that usually select suboptimal models. Second, the classifiers are trained using very large datasets which may be time consuming to obtain in practice. When the size of training dataset is small, the performance of a single BN classifier is significantly reduced due to its inability to represent the whole probability distribution. To alleviate these problems, we build a Bayesian classifier by Bayesian Model Averaging(BMA) over the k-best BN classifiers, called Bayesian Network Model Averaging (BNMA) classifier. We train and evaluate BNMA classifier on the NSL-KDD dataset, which is less redundant, thus more judicial than the commonly used KDD Cup 99 dataset. We show that the BNMA classifier performs significantly better in terms of detection accuracy than the Naive Bayes classifier and the BN classifier built with heuristic method. We also show that the BNMA classifier trained using a smaller dataset outperforms two other classifiers trained using a larger dataset. This also implies that the BNMA is beneficial in accelerating the detection process due to its less dependance on the potentially prolonged process of collecting large training datasets.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903117","Bayesian Model Averaging;Bayesian network;Intrusion detection system;detection accuracy","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Probability distribution;Testing;Training","belief networks;pattern classification;security of data;statistical analysis","BN classifiers;BNMA classifier;Bayesian model averaging;Bayesian network classifiers;KDD Cup 99 dataset;NSL-KDD dataset;detection accuracy;heuristic methods;intrusion detection;probability distribution;reasoning capabilities","","0","","27","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems attempt to detect things that are wrong in a computer network or system. The main problems of these systems, however, are the many false alarms they produce, their lack of resistance to both malicious attacks and accidental failures, and the constant appearance of new attacks and vulnerabilities. IBM Zurich Research Laboratory has developed a system that specifically targets worms rather than trying to prevent all breaches of computer security. Called Billy Goat, the specialized worm detection system runs on a dedicated machine connected to the network and detects worm-infected machines anywhere in it. Billy Goat has been proven effective at detecting worm-infected machines in a network. It is currently used in several large corporate intranets, and it is normally able to detect infected machines within seconds of their becoming infected. Furthermore, not only is it able to detect the presence of a worm in the network, it can even provide the addresses of the infected machines. This makes it considerably easier to remedy the problem.","0018-9235","","","10.1109/MSPEC.2005.1426967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1426967","","Computer networks;Computer security;Computer viruses;Computer worms;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protection","Internet;invasive software;telecommunication security","Billy Goat intrusion-detection system;Internet worm;computer network;computer virus;distributed architecture;worm alarms;worm-infected machines","","0","","4","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the cybersecurity vulnerability using attack trees. The attack tree formulation based on power system control networks is used to evaluate the system, scenario, and leaf vulnerabilities. The measure of vulnerabilities in the power system control framework is determined based on existing cybersecurity conditions before the vulnerability indices are evaluated. After the indices are evaluated, an upper bound is imposed on each scenario vulnerability in order to determine the pivotal attack leaves that require countermeasure improvements. The proposed framework can be extended to security investment analysis.","1932-5517","1-4244-1296-X","1-4244-1298-6","10.1109/PES.2007.385876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275642","Attack Tree;Cybersecurity;Defense Systems;Power System Control;Security Vulnerability","Computer security;Control systems;Power grids;Power system control;Power system protection;Power system security;SCADA systems;Supervisory control;Tree graphs;Upper bound","SCADA systems;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data","SCADA systems;attack trees;cybersecurity vulnerability;power system security;security investment analysis;vulnerability index","","26","","16","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This attack can be launched easily using minimal resources. In this paper we propose an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) along with Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that not only detects the de-authentication DoS attack in a Wi-Fi network but also helps the victim station (STA) in recovering swiftly from the attack.

In our research's next phase, we will develop and analyze policies with properties that maintain strict separation between services while allowing exceptions. Finally, we are developing improved trust management languages and systems that more explicitly support dynamic policies in service-oriented architectures, based on the semantic and performance experiences gained in the research's first phases. Our focus will be twofold. First, we will explore adding trust-management language features that better support dynamic policies, based both on our experiences in the initial research and on the GIG's specific requirements. Second, we will conduct experiments to measure the performance implications of incorporating the trust management layer in the various layers of such systems.

CART is used to build rule or model that will be implemented by fuzzy inference engine. Testing process is performed using Fuzzy Logic without doing defuzzification because the resulting rule will be used as a classification. Training, testing and validation of the model is done by using KDD Cup 1999 dataset that has been through the preprocessing and cleaning data process. Accuracy testing and validation is calculated by using the confusion matrix. From several test performed, the best model is built from training 70%, the depth of tree 11 and node leaf minimum percentage 90% with an accuracy was 85,68% and average time validation was 21,92 second.","","","","10.1109/ICoICT.2015.7231434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7231434","Anomaly Detection;Classification and Regression Tree;Fuzzy Logic;Intrusion Detection System;Misuse Detection","Conferences","fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;matrix algebra;pattern classification;regression analysis;security of data","CART;KDD Cup 1999 dataset;anomaly detection;classification and regression tree;cleaning data process;computer network attack;confusion matrix;defuzzification;fuzzy inference engine;fuzzy logic algorithm;fuzzy logic method;intrusion detection system;misuse detection;presence intrusion;signature detection;testing process","","0","","14","","","27-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
