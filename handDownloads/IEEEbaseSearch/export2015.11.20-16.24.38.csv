Recent successful malware attacks and the move towards cloud computing in data centers demand that attention be paid to the security aspects of Ethernet. In this paper, we present known Ethernet related threats and discuss existing solutions from business, hacker, and academic communities. Major issues, like insecurities related to Address Resolution Protocol and to self-configurability, are discussed. The solutions fall roughly into three categories: accepting Ethernet's insecurity and circling it with firewalls; creating a logical separation between the switches and end hosts; and centralized cryptography based schemes.

The security is the most important concepts that must be considered in computer networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that enhances the information security paradigm beyond traditional reactive and protective network security. It monitors and analyses the received packets in network systems and signs the security problems. Controlling the degree of security is one of the most challenges with IDS. An excessive increase in the IDS sensitivity may cause increasing the system costs and difficulties in accessing to the system. On the other hand, an excessive reduction in the IDS sensitivity may cause damages to system duo to not detecting most of the attacks. Making balance between these tradeoffs is a problem that the system administrator is unable to handle. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach to address the IDS sensitivity degree in the system. Our approach in comparison to the previous methods which model the behavior of the attacker and IDS, models the system and attacker as two-players, noncooperative game. We conduct our model on the famous data set in security area and obtained result is promising.","","978-1-4673-6489-8","","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620042","Nash Equilibrium;attacker cost;intrusion detection system;sensor cost","Ad hoc networks;Educational institutions;Games;Intrusion detection;Nash equilibrium;Sensitivity","computer network security;game theory","IDS behavior;IDS sensitivity control;IDS sensitivity degree;IDS sensitivity reduction;Internet;attacker behavior;attacker modelling;computer networks;game theoretic approach;information security paradigm enhancement;intrusion detection system;received packet analysis;received packet monitoring;security tool;social lives;system administrator;system costs;system modelling;two-player-noncooperative game","","0","","12","","","28-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9919-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935169","","Electrostatic discharge;Maximum likelihood estimation;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Security","Internet;maximum likelihood detection;probability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","compact information storage;high-speed network;intrusion detection system;maximum likelihood estimation;memory consumption;on-die memory space;optimal dynamic bit sharing;probabilistic sampling;probability;real Internet traffic trace;scan detection","","1","","20","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sci. & Eng., SNS Coll. of Technol., Coimbatore, India","Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI), 2015 International Conference on","20150824","2015","","","1","4","In the field of computer security, the intrusion detection system plays a major role. Whenever the intrusion takes place, intrusion detection technology is used to ensure the data integrity and system availability. Normally the intrusion is considered as an abnormal activity performed by the intruder. The breaking of information system or occurrence of any abnormal activity if performed by the intruder is known as intrusion. Based on the nature of access the intruders can be broadly classified into two groups, as internal intruders and external intruders. One who is having the access permission but trying to perform unauthorized or illegal activities is known as internal intruders. On the other hand one who do not have the access permission, but attacks the system with variety of techniques is called identified as external intruders. The IDS is a security management system for the computers and networks. It helps in monitoring and detecting all the activity which takes place in the Network. On consideration, the firewall technology works on the predetermined rule set. In contrast to this, IDS is potential to be present throughout the network as dynamic defense system. Hence it helps to catch all types of attacks. Genetic Algorithms (GA) is a method of search through solution space towards an optimal solution that uses the mechanics of natural selection and genetics. The main motivating factor for using GA is that it makes no use of domain knowledge; it works on probabilistic techniques making use of payoff data. Another huge advantage that GA has over other learning systems is that GA is totally unsupervised, once set in motion, it presents the user with a good solution. These coupled with the versatility and robustness of GA makes the technique of choice for this work. This research work focus on applying the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based on the classifiers to network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Unlike the other implementations, both temporal and spatial enc- ding information is considered here. It helps in identifying the complex behavior patterns.","","978-1-4799-6804-6","","10.1109/ICCCI.2015.7218129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218129","Genetic algorithm;Knowledge base;bayesian classifier;intrusion detection system","Encoding;Engines;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sociology;Statistics","Bayes methods;firewalls;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","Bayesian classifier;GA;IDS;complex behavior pattern identification;computer security;data integrity;dynamic defense system;external intruders;firewall technology;genetic algorithm;information system;internal intruders;learning systems;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusion identification;predetermined rule set;probabilistic techniques;security management system;spatial encoding information;system availability;temporal encoding information","","0","","10","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An interesting possibility to materialize self-* support - and self-healing support as well - in network management is through the employment of peer-to-peer (P2P) management overlays. Considering this scenario, we introduce in this paper a self-healing service provided by a prototype P2P-Based Network Management (P2PBNM) system. Such a service is expected to be contracted by human administrators interested in monitoring and recovering their IT infrastructures. In addition, an experimental evaluation of the self-healing service is performed considering a case study where a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) needs to be constantly observed and eventually healed to keep the underlying communication network protected.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990706","","Maintenance engineering;Monitoring;Prototypes","Web services;computer network management;computer network security;peer-to-peer computing","HIDS;P2P-based network management;P2P-based self-healing service;distributed network management;host-based intrusion detection system;human administrators;network maintenance;peer-to-peer management;self-healing figures;self-management vision","","4","","26","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linear prediction is employed to extract features from system calls sequences of the privileged processes which are used to make up of the character database of those processes, and then the Markov chain model is founded based on those features. The observed behavior of the system is analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov chain model of the norm profile supports the observed behavior.

We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt. For heap overflow vulnerability, we can automatically exploit the unlink() macro of glibc, which formerly requires sophisticated hacking efforts.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2014.2299198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717039","Automatic exploit generation;bug forensics;software crash analysis;symbolic execution;taint analysis","Analytical models;Computer crashes;Concrete;Libraries;Registers;Security;Software","computer crime;program diagnostics;program testing;software fault tolerance;symbol manipulation","Microsoft office word;S<sup>2</sup>E;archiver;attack generation;automatic exploit generation;binary programs;concolic executions;end-to-end approach;format string;foxit;heap overflows;mapped symbolic memory;media player;mitigation-hardened exploits;mpalyer;pdf reader;pseudo symbolic variables;software crash analysis;software failures;software fuzz testing targets;sophisticated hacking efforts;stack overflows;symbolic failure model;symbolic pointers;unrar;word processor","","1","","30","","2014-01-20","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This model is adopted distributed architecture. In order to reduce the relativity of each detection components as far as possible and avoid the simple failure point caused by the single central analyzer, the model is adopted the non-control center multi-SoftMan architecture, which is making enough use of SM attributes, such as independence, activity, self-learning, self-adaptation, self-evolution and society.

A parameterizable cluster of simple processors provides system scalability. Hardware NIDSs described in the literature often employ hardwired comparators to verify if the incoming network traffic has data potentially containing intrusion attacks. Such NIDSs must be re-synthesized when a new set of rules is available, which happens frequently. In SPP-NIDS, the rule set defining network intrusion patterns is stored in RAM, enabling its straightforward upgrade. The proposed system, when implemented in a 2-million gate FPGA is able to work at a 100 Mbps network data rate, using the complete set of SNORT rules.

In this paper, we first propose rule organized optimal matching (ROOM),which splits the identification rules into several fields and elaborately organizes the matching order of the fields. Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set). Based on ROOM, wefurther propose MP-ROOM, which is extended to well support the rules cross multiple protocol data units (PDUs) fortraffic identification. In addition, we implement a prototype system including MP-ROOM and related work for evaluations.The evaluations show very promising results: 1.5 ~71.3 times throughput improvement is obtained by MP-ROOM inthe real system with less than 300-MB memory consumption.

This problem is especially challenging in the world of network intrusion detection. In this realm, we must not only deal with sifting through vast amounts of data, but we must also do it in a timely manner even when at times we are not sure what exactly it is we are trying to find. In the grander scheme of our work we intend to demonstrate that several different data mining algorithms reporting to an overarching layer will yield more accurate results than anyone data mining application (or algorithm) acting on its own. The system will operate in the domain of offline network and computer forensic data mining, under the guidance of a hybrid intelligence/multi-agent, systems based, for interpretation and interpolation of the findings. Toward that end, in this paper we build upon earlier work, undertaking the steps required for generating and preparing suitably minable data. Specifically, we are concerned with extracting as much useful data as possible out of a PCAP (Packet capture) for importing into Weka. While a PCAP may have thousands of field/value pairs, Wireshark and tshark's csv (comma separated value) output module only renders a small percentage of these fields and their values by default. We introduce a tool of our own making which enumerates every field (with or without a value) in any PCAP and generates an ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format - Weka default). This code represents a component of a larger application we are designing (future work) which will ingest a PCAP, semi-autonomously preprocess it and feed it into Weka for processing/mining using several different algorithms.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888681","ARFF;Data Mining;Intrusion Detection Systems;PCAP;PDML;Weka","Artificial intelligence;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Databases;Intrusion detection","data mining;security of data","PCAP;Weka mineable data;attribute relation file format - weka default;computer forensic data mining;data mining algorithms;hybrid intelligence multiagent;information overload problem;network intrusion detection;offline network;packet capture","","1","","20","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","30","1","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type ""opportunistic adversaries"". This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats.

Concerning heavy tails in preprocessing, our study reveals that snort preprocessing times give rise to a cumulative distribution function which is extremely heavy-tailed. Concerning temporal correlations, our analysis reveals that payload processing times evolve in two time scales: a fast time scale and a slow time scale. The fast, packet-to-packet time scale corresponds to 40-100 contiguous packets (a packet group), within which the content matching times are independent. In the slow, packet group-to-packet group time scale the mean values of the successive packet groups are heavily correlated and can be predicted.

At first, background images are collected for a while, because we assume that the motion of background is well known. Then, the background images are compressed using eigenspace method to form a database. While monitoring the scene, new image is taken by a camera, and the image is projected onto the eigenspace to estimate the background. But however, the estimated image is much affected by the intruders, so the intruder region is calculated by using background subtraction with former estimated background to exclude the region from the projection. Thus the image whose intruder region is replaced by the former background is projected to eigenspace and we have updated background.

These models are used in developing traffic analysis tools. This paper focuses on development of a behavior analysis tool on any operating system and its use on detecting internal active/passive attacks. Many kinds of tools and firewalls are in market to help network administrator to prevent intrusion from outside network, but very few tools to stop attacks from internal part of the network. This tool provides a way to detect any unusual behavior by a legitimate user in a network. It uses packet sniffer like Wireshark to record log traffic over a network. Furthermore, behavioral analysis is carried in two phases. In the first phase, Wireshark records the user's interaction with the network for a period of time and is stored in database. In second phase, current activity is compared to the past activity and notifies any new behavior to network administrator. This tool adds an additional layer of security along with the intrusion detection systems available from any network attacks. Many additional features can be incorporated in this tool for future enhancement.","","978-1-61284-485-5","","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6014810","Network behavior analysis (NBA);Packet capture;network administrator (NA)","Electronic publishing;Filtering;Information services;Internet","pattern matching;security of data","Wireshark;behavior analysis tool;behavior based network traffic analysis tool;behavioral analysis;firewalls;intrusion detection system;log traffic;network administrator;network model;operating system;packet sniffer;pattern matching system;user statistics","","3","","8","","","27-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks. Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.","1081-6011","0-7695-2136-3","","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324","","Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing","authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security","Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis","","15","1","27","","","9-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, context awareness has become popular to accompany these services not only to enhance the users' perceived service quality but also to improve the overall utilization of such cooperative networks. However, delivering context-aware multimedia content through these cooperative networks is associated with a significant research challenge due to the inherently different satellites and terrestrial networks technologies. For example, to provide context-specific TV programs to a user, a satellite needs to adopt unicast-style delivery. This may be an expensive operation since satellites are intrinsically useful for broadcasting or multicasting services to a wide audience. In contrast, terrestrial communication networks can be better suited to perform unicast-based context-aware content delivery. In this article, we address these challenges, and propose a dynamic bandwidth allocation method to effectively utilize the satellite and terrestrial networks for providing context-aware contents to many users.

The architecture's approach to naming and addressing fundamentally differs from the approach used in the current Internet. Great care is taken to distinguish between names and addresses. Names are used to identify entities and generally have a large scope. Addresses, however, are used to locate entities within a limited scope and are consequently not necessarily globally significant. These properties in particular create additional challenges when capturing and analysing network traffic as evidence.

Hierarchically clustering technique is able to help IDS operators to get meaningful overviews from the great number of alarms. A dilemma is encountered when the clusters are generated. If the clusters are obtained one by one, they cannot be prevented from overlapping each other, which makes it quite likely to mislead the operator, if they are obtained in a batch, the total number of clusters must be guessed before clustering, which indicates possibly imprecise cluster number or repeated running. In this paper, we propose a GA (genetic algorithm)-based approach in which vary-lengthed chromosomes are adopted instead of fixed-lengthed chromosomes. The encoding scheme is that different numbers of clusters are encoded into different lengths of chromosomes. In addition, the other genetic operations such as selection, crossover and mutation, are discussed in detail. Results from several experiments are quite encouraging, including that the newly proposed approach is able to efficiently generate fitful number of clusters of high quality in a batch.","","978-1-4244-8627-4","","10.1109/ISIP.2010.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669026","genetic algorithm;hierarchical clustering;intrusion detection system;vary-lengthed chromosome","Approximation algorithms;Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Equations;Gallium;Humans","biology computing;cellular biophysics;genetic algorithms;pattern clustering;security of data","GA;encoding scheme;hierarchically clustering technique;intrusion detection systems;vary-lengthed chromosomes","","0","","11","","","15-17 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), efficiently identifying the botnet in time can be a challenge. Recently, the unsupervised learning methods such as the K-means, self-organizing map (SOM), and growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) have been shown to be able to facilitate network anomaly detection. However, there is no study focusing on mining IP flows with high variability of attacks in an intuitive way. In this study, we leverage the visualization specialty of GHSOM to help analyze the static IP flow data, also called the network traces of victims, to identify any suspicious IP source. The GHSOM can generate a hierarchical architecture based on the input data and help reveal their inherent hierarchical relationships. For example, the geometric distances between each attack pattern and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space which forms the signature of a botnet. The IP flows clustered by GHSOM are grouped with distinctive connecting features, and the differences between each cluster are visualized with sequential time stamps which can be used to portray various attack patterns, help explore the sources of attacks and understand the behaviors of attacks. The experimental results from real-world traffic data show that forensic analysis using GHSOM can efficiently identify several DDoS attack patterns and generate filtering rules for intrusion detection system (IDS) by further inspecting and book marking the suspicious IP sources.","","978-1-4799-3143-9","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753967","Data clustering;Feature extraction;Network anomaly detection;Network forensics;Neural networks","Data visualization;Filtering;Forensics;IP networks;Internet;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","IP networks;computer network security;data analysis;data visualisation;digital forensics;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","Botnet;GHSOM visualization specialty;IDS;IP sources;K-means;attack pattern detection;book marking;distributed denial of service attack;filtering rule generation;geometric distances;growing hierarchical SOM;growing hierarchical self-organizing map;hierarchical architecture;intrusion detection system;network anomaly detection;network forensic analysis;network traffic data;real-world traffic data;sequential time stamps;several DDoS attack patterns;static IP flow data analysis;topological space;unsupervised learning methods;victim network traces","","0","","14","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It detects malicious activities by monitoring network traffic. There are two main classes of IDS: the anomaly-based IDS and signature-based IDS. An important challenge, for signature-based IDS, is automating attack signature writing from traffic logs, which can be very hard to be established for human administrator. In this paper, we propose a solution addressing this challenge. We propose cloud-based signature learning service using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Learning service generates rule describing properties shared by packets labelled as malicious and that do not cover normal packets. The system uses a background knowledge composed of predicates used to describe network attack signature. The cloud architecture of our IDS enables it to have specialized nodes.

Open medium, wide distribution and de-centralization of nodes makes MANETs vulnerable and malicious. It is crucial to develop efficient intrusion detection system to protect MANETs. A new intrusion detection system named bandwidth shared acknowledgment (BSA) in which all transmission packet data and acknowledge should be cryptographically signed. Swarm Based Detection techniques for multiple paths establishment among source to destination and random casting is use during intrusion in MANETs. Eavesdropping in MANET is scheduled based on number of acknowledgement received at every instance in network. The theme of this paper is to provide a seamless message delivery in a MANET despite its threats using random casting and the existing mechanisms like 2-hop acknowledgement or source directed acknowledgement does not hold when a network topology changes frequently or when a node is compromised. These drawbacks are to be addressed ensuring secured connecting edges between source and destination. The source collision, exposure to vulnerability is also minimized using this mechanism. We propose an optimize solution for above problem using BSA techniques which overcomes eaves dropping based on acknowledgement from intermediate only.","","978-1-4799-3835-3","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033819","Bandwidth Shared Acknowledgment (BSA);Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET);Random Casting;Swarm Detection","Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Casting;Delays;Digital signatures;Mobile computing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;safety systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","2-hop acknowledgement;BSA techniques;MANET protection;bandwidth shared acknowledgment;connecting edges security;cryptography;eavesdropping;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing;multiple path establishment;network topology;node decentralization;node open medium;node wide distribution;random casting;seamless message delivery;secure intrusion detection system efficiency;source collision;source directed acknowledgement;swarm based detection techniques;transmission packet data","","0","","9","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Obtaining an optimal IDS configuration for effective detection of attacks is far from trivial. There exists a tradeoff between security enforcement levels and the performance of information systems. It is critical to configure an IDS in a dynamic and iterative fashion to balance the security overhead and system performance. In this paper, we use noncooperative game approaches to address this problem. We first build a fundamental game framework to model the zero-sum interactions between the detector and the attacker. Building on this platform, we then formulate a stochastic game model in which the transitions between system states are determined by the actions chosen by both players.

The number of system reinstallations may be increased when the hosts get unstable (infected or quarantined). In view of such situation, dynamic birth and death rates are introduced. Afterwards, the stability of the positive equilibrium is studied. Through the theoretical analysis, it is proved that the model is locally asymptotically stable without time delay. Moreover, a bifurcation appears when time delay t passes a constant value which means that the worm propagation system is unstable and uncontrollable. Thus, the time delay should be decreased in order to predict or eliminate the worm propagation. Finally, a numeric simulation is presented which fully supports our analysis.","","978-1-4673-0198-5","","10.1109/ICSAI.2012.6223326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6223326","bifurcation;birth and death rates;time delay;worm propagation","Bifurcation;Computational modeling;Delay effects;Educational institutions;Grippers;Mathematical model;Stability analysis","asymptotic stability;delays;invasive software","bifurcation;birth rates;death rates;delayed worm propagation model;positive equilibrium;stability;system reinstallations;theoretical analysis;time delay","","0","","9","","","19-20 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal was to test EFW scalability in a fully operational environment. A host-based, distributed firewall like EFW requires a different perspective on policy configuration and management than a conventional perimeter firewall. They can improve overall network security by pushing protection to the network endpoints. We implemented the following workaround: protecting first the critical mission assets; restrict access to a host but relax access from the host; leverage other available countermeasures. We also instrumented the internal network with a freeware intrusion detection system (IDS) to monitor the link between the enclave and the satellite connection leading to the perimeter firewall and the extranet.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232439","","Computer crime;Data analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Meeting planning;Network servers;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Web server","Internet;authorisation;client-server systems;computer crime;computer network management;message authentication;telecommunication security;virtual private networks","3com embedded firewall;EFW management;IDS;IRC;Internet relay chat;VLAN technology;Web servers;distributed embedded firewall;host based scalable network;intrusion detection system;mail servers;network security;policy configuration;virtual local area network","","0","1","3","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, it is necessary to distribute intrusion detection sensors across multiple protected networks, manage their configuration as the security posture of the networks changes, and process the results of their analysis so that a high-level picture of the security state of the network can be provided to the administrators. This paper presents Hi-DRA, a network surveillance, analysis, and response system for high-speed WANs. The system provides a framework for the modular development of intrusion detection sensors in heterogeneous, high-speed environments. In addition, the system provides an infrastructure that supports the dynamic configuration of the sensors and the collection and interpretation of their results.

P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions. Lastly, a preliminary evaluation of the run-time overhead is discussed.","1066-6192","978-0-7695-3544-9","","10.1109/PDP.2009.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4912959","introspection;intrusion detection system;sense of self;static analysis;virtual machines","Condition monitoring;Law;Legal factors;Libraries;Protection;Robustness;Runtime;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing","context-free grammars;operating system kernels;program diagnostics;virtual machines","PsycoTrace run-time tool;assertion evaluation;context-free grammar;introspection tool;legal trace;operating system kernel module;source code;static analysis;system call;transparent process self monitoring;virtual machine;virtual process self monitoring","","1","","16","","","18-20 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a networked DC motor system as an example, a tradeoff model for performance and security on NCS is presented. This paper also presents a framework of performance-security tradeoff optimization based on coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CGA) for the networked DC motor system.

This IDS enables nodes to detect whether their next node on a path flow forwards correctly packets or not by overhearing its transmissions. However, as Watchdog does not consider the packet loss ratio, it can lead to false positives. Indeed, a node can accuse another node of misbehaving whereas in reality it suffers from link loss. In order to overcome this issue, we propose an extension scheme to the Watchdog IDS which enables a node to determine whether it does not overhear its next node due to packet loss issue or due to misbehavior. To reach this goal, we assume that malicious nodes drop both acknowledgements and forwarded packets with different frequencies. Thus, our scheme compares the distribution of a node's acknowledgment with its distribution of forwarded packets of data to detect misbehaving nodes. Furthermore, we extend our scheme so that it enables a node to monitor both its next node and its previous node on a flow path.","","978-1-4673-6425-6","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632124","","Mobile computing;Multiaccess communication;Packet loss;Random variables;Vectors;Wireless mesh networks","security of data;trusted computing;wireless mesh networks","Watchdog IDS;Watchdog extension;intrusion detection system;link loss;malicious nodes;packet loss;reputation system;trust system;wireless mesh network","","1","","11","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our architecture-based analysis is different from most other approaches to analyzing complex systems in that it addresses multiple quality attributes simultaneously (e.g., performance, reliability, security, modifiability, usability, etc.) and it considers the architecture of a complex system from a socio-technical perspective where the actions of the people in the system are as important, from an analysis perspective, as the physical and computational elements of the system.

The ability to obfuscate the adversary's view of an organization's internal network is thought to confound the adversary's network reconnaissance steps, causing certain inefficiencies in nation state actors' attack processes. Novel Moving Target Network (MTN) techniques have been proposed specifically to hide communicating endpoint identities, blinding the adversary's view of the nodes in the network. To date, however, no published work has evaluated identity-only obfuscation approaches against using IPsec ESP tunnels as a way of hiding endpoint identities. The question is, are there some network configurations where identity-only obfuscation techniques work better than IPsec ESP tunnels? We present arguments that low-overhead MTN identity-only obfuscation approaches may work more efficiently on wireless mobile, tactical, peer-to-peer networks where processing energies and transmission bandwidth are constrained and we also discuss features of metrics for measuring the success of moving target network approaches, helping to guide future research in this area.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-1729-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415740","","Bandwidth;Encryption;IP networks;Logic gates;Payloads","IP networks;computer networks","IPsec ESP tunnels;MTN techniques;computer networks;identity-only obfuscation techniques;moving target network;moving target networks;network reconnaissance steps;organization internal network;peer-to-peer networks;tactical networks;wireless mobile","","0","","20","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data collected from IoT is usually offloaded to the Cloud which may further leave data prone to a variety of attacks if security and privacy issues are not handled properly. Anomaly detection has been one of the widely adopted security measures in wired and wireless networks. However, it is not straight forward to apply most of the anomaly detection techniques to IoT and cloud. One of the main challenges is deriving outlier features from the vast volume of data pumped from IoT to the cloud. Other challenges include the large number of sources generating data, heterogenous connectivity and traffic patterns of IoT devices, cloud services being offered at geographically remote places and causing IoT data to be stored in different countries with different legislations. This paper, for the first time, presents the challenges and opportunities in anomaly detection for IoT and cloud. It first introduces the prominent features and application fields of IoT and Cloud, then discusses security and privacy risks to personal information and finally focuses on solutions from anomaly detection perspective.","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247572","","Big data;Cloud computing;Internet of things;Privacy;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Web services;cloud computing;data privacy;security of data","IoT concept;IoT devices;anomaly detection techniques;cloud services;cloud-centric Internet of Things;personal information;privacy breach;privacy preservation;privacy risks;security breach;security risks;wired networks;wireless networks","","","","33","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most fundamental parameter, POD, is normally related to a number of factors such as the event of interest, the sensitivity of the sensor, the installation quality of the system and the reliability of the sensing equipment. A critical performance parameter of any outdoor perimeter intrusion detection system is its capability of discriminating between intrusion and nuisance events without compromising its sensitivity or POD. In this paper, the performance criteria of a real-time fence-mounted distributed fiber-optic intrusion detection system are discussed. The use of event recognition and classification techniques to maintain high detection rates and minimize alarms caused by nuisance events is presented with a performance analysis for different event classification algorithms. Practical results for the detection of intrusion events and suppression of nuisances are also shown.","1071-6572","978-1-4244-7403-5","","10.1109/CCST.2010.5678690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678690","Event classification;fiber-optic sensor;intrusion detection","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optical fiber cables;Optical fiber sensors;Rain;Real time systems","alarm systems;fibre optic sensors;reliability;safety systems","event classification algorithm;false alarm rate;nuisance alarm rate;performance investigation;probability of detection;real time fence mounted distributed fiber-optic intrusion detection system;real-time fiber optic perimeter intrusion detection systems;sensing equipment reliability","","0","","11","","","5-8 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem can be mitigated through feature selection to reduce the size of the network data involved. In this research work, we first consider existing feature selection methods that are computationally feasible for processing huge network intrusion datasets. Each of the feature selection methods was treated as an expert capable of identifying useful features from the datasets. A feature that is selected by these experts implies its importance in detecting network intrusions. The important features were subsequently grouped to form feature sets based on the frequency of selection. One such feature set was able to produce classification results comparable to feature sets generated by single feature selection methods and was also comparable to classification results of the winner of KDD CUP competition.","","978-1-4244-5650-5","","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466923","Feature Selection;Naïve Bayes Classifier;Network Intrusion Detection","Artificial intelligence;Computational efficiency;Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Frequency;IP networks;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Protection","belief networks;expert systems;pattern classification;security of data","feature selection methods;network intrusion classification;optimal feature set","","0","","15","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In terms of information security, incrementing the intrusion detection rate on anomaly attacks and decreasing the high false positive rate has been the two major concerns for every sysadmin. The huge amount of logs generated by different assets in the network are not always capable to be correlated and reviewed to determine possible security breaches. We implemented a new reliable and scalable classification-based hybrid IPS that can easily manage the processing of all the authentication log information of different IPSs in the network. This enhanced framework can determine in a more precise manner if a communication can be considered legitimate or an intrusion. This classification method increases the intrusion detection rate and decreases the false positive rate. Our main objective in this paper is to enforce redundancy on different modules of the framework. Our results show that a framework with these features can be easily deployed in networks to ensure reliable security.","","978-1-4799-1774-7","","10.1109/WAINA.2015.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096243","classification-based hybrid ips;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;ips;mongodb;reliable ips;scalabe ips;syslog","Collaboration;Correlation;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Reliability;Servers","computer network security;telecommunication network reliability","anomaly attacks;authentication log information;computer network security;false positive rate;hybrid IPS;information security reliability;intrusion detection rate;intrusion prevention systems;reliable classification;reliable security;scalable classification","","0","","14","","","24-27 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, an intrusion detection system would reduce the number of false positives if, in addition to the alarm, the system would also transmitted a picture or video of the intruder. The problem is how to overcome the known limitations of current wireless sensor networks to support multimedia applications in terms of throughput, delay and jitter while being energy efficient. This paper presents LEMR-multichannel, an extension of LEMR for real-time applications over wireless sensor networks to address these issues. LEMR-multichannel takes advantage of the delay, jitter and energy-efficiency of LEMR, and includes an energy-efficient new dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism that uses the different channels available in the single transceiver device to enhance the throughput capability of the network. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMR-multichannel in terms of these performance metrics when compared with well-known protocols, such as LEMR, SMAC, TMAC and SCP-MAC.","","978-1-4244-4387-1","978-1-4244-4388-8","10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5305150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305150","Energy;Jitter;Latency;MAC;Multimedia;Network;Routing;Sensor;Wireless","Access protocols;Acoustic sensors;Data engineering;Delay;Energy efficiency;Jitter;Media Access Protocol;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","jitter;multimedia communication;transceivers;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","LEMR-multichannel;adaptive multichannel;multimedia application;network delay;network jitter;network throughput;real-time multimedia wireless sensor network;scalar sensor data;throughput capability;transceiver device","","1","","15","","","10-11 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is, given two arbitrary machines, A and B, on the Internet, our technique measures the round trip time from A to B. We take advantage of information side-channels that are present in the TCP/IP network stack of modern Linux kernels to infer information about off-path routes. Compared to previous tools, ours does not require additional resources, machines, or require additional protocols beyond TCP. The only requirements are that one end host have an open port and be running a modern Linux kernel and that the other end host responds to unsolicited SYN-ACK packets with a RST packet. We evaluate our technique “in the wild” and compare our off-path estimates to on-path measurements. Our experiments show that our technique provides accurate, real-time estimates of off-path network latency. In over 80% of measurements our technique provides off-path round trip time measurements within 20% of the actual round trip time. We also discuss possible causes of errors that impact the accuracy of our measurements.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218538","","Extraterrestrial measurements;IP networks;Kernel;Linux;Loss measurement;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;telecommunication channels;transport protocols","Internet;Linux kernel;RST packet;TCP-IP network stack protocol;TCP-IP side channel;off-path round trip time measurement;round trip time network latency estimation;unsolicited SYN-ACK packet","","0","","22","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
