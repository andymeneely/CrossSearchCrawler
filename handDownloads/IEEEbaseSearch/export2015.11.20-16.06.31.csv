However, attack trends change very fast nowadays, making it impossible to keep up with manual signature engineering. This paper describes a novel concept for automatic signature generation based on efficient autonomous attack classification. Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance. We argue that a general description of zero-day attacks is immanently restricted to syntactical features and outline how valid signatures for novel real-world attacks were successfully generated.","","978-1-4244-5786-1","","10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403022","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Production;Protection;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security","Nebula;automatic signature generation;autonomous attack classification;malicious activity identification;positional information;signature accuracy;signature matching;signature-based intrusion detection;syntactical network intrusion signatures","","3","","16","","","13-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this field, how to improve detection rate is one of key issues. In this paper, the importance of event sequence in time is presented. Then, we discuss three factors, i.e. timestamp precision, time synchronization and network delay, which effect detection rate on the view of event sequence in time. On the three aspects, timestamp precision is the key to keep internal event sequence, time synchronization is the base of correcting event sequence among computers, and that network delay makes time-series analysis not true. Accordingly, we address some methods, i.e. raising timestamp precision, active self- adapting time synchronization algorithm and state turnabout mechanism. Experiments indicate that anyone of three measures can elevate detection performance to a certain extent.

In this paper, we are interested in the NIDSs. In fact the constant increase in network speed and throughput pose new challenges to these systems. Current NIDSs are designed to 10/100 Mbps [6], nevertheless large network installations are Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps), so the task of detection becomes increasingly difficult with only one NIDS.

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7980-6","","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions","Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching","","0","","24","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer. Empirical testing has been done proving the usefulness of this alternative and low cost approach in defending networks. The functionality of the system was also extended by installing nodes in different geographical locations, and streaming their detections into the central Amber hive.","","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641053","Honeypot;Security Models","Context;IP networks;Information security;Internet;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;decision making","DtD;DtP;South African market;central Amber hive;decision making;decision through detection;decision through presence;geographical locations;human capital;modular intelligence;network enforcer;security control;zero-interaction honeypot;zero-interaction security system","","0","","22","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts: source code, and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities. We framed our study using Situation Awareness-a cognitive theory from psychology-to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis. We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive, comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications, in addition, to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications.

COMPSAC '09. 33rd Annual IEEE International","20090922","2009","1","","392","399","The wide spread of worms poses serious challenges to today's Internet.Various IDSes (intrusion detection systems) have been proposed to identify or prevent such spread. These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance. We test the effectiveness of PAIDS with trace-driven simulations and show that PAIDS has a high detection rate and a low false positive rate.","0730-3157","978-0-7695-3726-9","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254234","Intrusion Detection System;Proximity;Worm","Application software;Collaborative work;Computer applications;Computer worms;Educational institutions;Failure analysis;Impedance;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis","Internet;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;PAIDS;anomaly detection;proximity-assisted intrusion detection system;signature-based scheme;unidentified worm","","0","","35","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have been gaining popularity due to their high potential in widespread applications and becoming realizable due to the rapid advancements in embedded systems, wireless communication and data transfer technologies. This paper addresses the issue of D-NCS information security as well its time-sensitive performance with respect to network security schemes. We use a wireless network based, robot navigation path tracking system called Intelligent Space (iSpace) as a D-NCS test bed in this paper. The paper classifies the delay data from every NCS module (sensors, actuators and controllers). We define performance parameters for this NCS test bed. Various system factors including network delay, system gain, affecting these performance parameters are recognized. Network security algorithms DES and 3DES are integrated with the application to secure the sensitive information flow. Standard statistical approach such as 2<sup>k</sup> factorial experiment design, analysis of variance, hypothesis testing is used to study and estimate the effect of each factor on the system performance especially security features. Thorough experimental results, tables of detailed characterization and effect estimate analysis is presented followed by the discussion on the performance comparison of NCS with and without wireless security.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455044","Distributed networked-control-system;data security;data-sensitive wireless network;iSpace","Actuators;Communication system control;Communication system security;Data security;Information security;Intelligent robots;Intelligent sensors;Space technology;System testing;Wireless sensor networks","","","","3","","13","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We need to distinguish anomalies that change the traffic either abruptly or slowly. While a good amount of research has been done for fixed wired networks, not much research has been done in this area for wireless networks due to lack of a good data set.

It employs a sensor array that endows the platform with a spatial-resolution capability. Given the difficulty of collecting data involving animal motion, a simulation tool was created with the aid of Blender and OpenGL software that is capable of quickly generating streams of human and animal-intrusion data. The generated data was then examined to identify a suitable collection of features that are useful in classification. The features selected corresponded to parameters that model the received signal as the super-imposition of a fixed number of chirplets, an energy signature and a cross-correlation parameter. The resultant feature vector was then passed on to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. This approach to classification was validated by making use of real-world data collected by the STP which showed both STP design as well as classification technique employed to be quite effective.

We propose a head-body finite automaton (HBFA), which implements SPM in two parts: a head DFA (H-DFA) and a body NFA (B-NFA). The H-DFA matches the dictionary up to a predefined prefix length in the same way as AC-DFA, but with a much smaller memory footprint. The B-NFA extends the matching to full dictionary lengths in a compact variable-stride branch data structure, accelerated by single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. A branch grafting mechanism is proposed to opportunistically advance the state of the H-DFA with the matching progress in the B-NFA. Compared with a fully populated AC-DFA, our HBFA prototype has <;1/5 construction time, requires <;1/20 runtime memory, and achieves 3x to 8x throughput when matching real-life large dictionaries against inputs with high match ratios.

In this scenario, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate and compare automaton models and the data-structures that materialize them. We also adapt state-of-the-art memory layouts to better fit in today's computer architectures. Finally, we apply our methodology to most important automaton models, memory layouts, and well-known signature sets.

Analogous to traffic normalization for network intrusion detection systems, the proposed RouteNormalizer patches ambiguities and eliminates semantically incorrect routing updates to protect against routing protocol attacks. Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implementation based on empirical BGP routing updates. We validate its effectiveness by showing that many well-known routing problems from operator mailing lists are correctly identified.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272952","","Frequency;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Routing protocols;Spine;Stress;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","BGP routing;RouteNormaIizer;TCP proxy;firewall;local network;network intrusion detection systems;resource-based attacks;routers;routing misbehavior;routing protocol attacks;traffic normalization","","0","","47","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, defensive techniques such as intrusion detection will need to be deployed and used in this already complicated system. Deployment and runtime cost due to the defensive systems will affect the normal function of smart grid system without careful planning and design. This paper is an effort to address this issue. In particular, we apply the set packing algorithm to optimize (minimize) the placement of the trust nodes of the defensive system in the multiple layer architecture of the smart grid. After the trust nodes are placed, a Dijkstra's based optimal routing algorithm is used to find the least cost routing between the communications of the nodes.

Discussions in the security community often state that port scans should be considered as precursors to an attack. However, very few studies have been conducted to quantify the validity of this hypothesis. In this paper, attack data were collected using a test-bed dedicated to monitoring attackers. The data collected consist of port scans, ICMP scans, vulnerability scans, successful attacks and management traffic. Two experiments were performed to validate the hypothesis of linking port scans and vulnerability scans to the number of packets observed per connection. Customized scripts were then developed to filter the collected data and group them on the basis of scans and attacks between a source and destination IP address pair. The correlation of the filtered data groups was assessed. The analyzed data consists of forty-eight days of data collection for two target computers on a heavily utilized subnet.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467834","","Data analysis;Data security;Educational institutions;Engineering profession;Filtering;Filters;Joining processes;Mechanical engineering;Monitoring;Testing","IP networks;computer crime;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","ICMP scans;IP address;attack data collection;filtered data groups;management traffic;port scans;vulnerability scans","","16","","29","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within this project, a main component is in charge of instantiating new security policies that counteract the network attacks. This paper proposes an ontology-based approach to instantiate these security policies.

We present the basic ideas, discuss the main implementation issues, and perform a preliminary experimental campaign. Not only have experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in protecting the system against two very serious attacks to WSNs (namely: sinkhole, and bogus packet), but they have also proved that the stringent requirements (in terms of limited availability of resources) which are typical of current state-of-the-art WSN technologies, are met.","","978-1-4244-8080-7","","10.1109/CRIS.2010.5617547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5617547","Critical Information Infrastructures;Critical Infrastructures;Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","bogus packet;critical information infrastructures;intrusion detection system;malicious activities;sinkhole;wireless sensor network","","6","","34","","","20-22 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although traditional detection methodologies employing signature and anomaly based systems have had reasonable success, new class of spyware programs emerge which blend in with user activities to avoid detection. One of the latest anti-spyware technologies consists of a local agent that generates honeytokens of known parameters (e.g., network access requests) and tricks spyware into assuming it to be legitimate activity. In this paper, as a first step, we address the deficiencies of static honeytoken generation and present an attack that circumvents such detection techniques. We synthesize the attack by means of data mining algorithms like associative rule mining. Next, we present a randomized honeytoken generation mechanism to address this new class of spyware. Experimental results show that (i) static honeytokens are detected with near 100% accuracy, thereby defeating the state-of-the-art anti-spyware technique, (ii) randomized honeytoken generation mechanism is an effective anti-spyware solution.","1097-2641","1-4244-1138-6","1-4244-1138-6","10.1109/PCCC.2007.358933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197969","Associative Rule Mining;Honeytokens;Spyware;User Activity","Computer science;Data analysis;Data mining;History;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Network synthesis;Privacy;Security","data mining;invasive software","SpyCon;anti-spyware technologies consists;associative rule mining;data mining algorithms;evasive spyware detection;randomized honeytoken generation mechanism;static honeytoken generation","","1","5","27","","","11-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This sketch is used to reduce the required memory, while monitoring the traffic, by maintaining them into a predefined fixed size of hash tables. This sketch is also used to develop a probabilistic model. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used for detecting deviations between previously established and current distributions of network traffic.

Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic. As far as we know we are the first paper, that analyzes the problem of 'on-the-fly' multi-patterns matching algorithms on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061944","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Compression algorithms;Computer science;Data security;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;data compression;digital signatures;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;GZIP compression;HTTP protocol;Web traffic;compressed HTTP traffic;decompression phase;malicious activity detection;network security tool;signature-based detection;string-matching algorithm","","5","3","25","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Normal operational behaviors can be modeled and integrated into the TFIDS with alarm filtering and reporting rules. Trust anchors within the system are required to collect some of the signals, ensure the signal integrity when delivered to the TFIDS, and to host the TFIDS if physical attacks are a concern.

Therefore, we propose a new scheme that applies health care within wireless sensor networks in which sensor nodes can measure the vital signs of the aged people and the patients. The vital signs for blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature measured by sensor nodes would be transmitted to mobile devices of medical staff and system administrator. Sensor node readings enable the medical staff to understand the conditions of the patients in real time which improves the quality of health care for the patients. According to the personal data protection act, the vital signs of the patients can only be accessed by the authorized medical staff. In order to protect the privacy of patients, the administrator will verify the identity of medical staff through the mobile device with smart card and password. Accordingly, only the verified medical staff can obtain the vital signs such as blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature of the patients. Besides, the scheme includes a characteristic of time-bounded, and then the medical staffs can obtain the vital signs without re-authenticating and re-login into the system in a period of time.

However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177","Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management","Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism","","0","","11","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly detection in networks is of interest from two perspectives: an organization's perspective and an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) perspective. Protection of its computer network infrastructure is an important task for all organizations. Organizations desire that their networks are robust and resilient to any kind of attack. Anomaly detection forms an important part of this network resiliency. Also the ISPs want to maximize the utilization of their resources. Hence an ISP would be interested to know any resource failure immediately so as to correct the problem. ISPs would also be interested in safeguarding their network from malicious activities. We describe here a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based traffic verification system as a paradigm for network anomaly detection. The traffic characteristics aggregated over a period of time is given to the model to verify the validity of the traffic. If the traffic does not obey the model then we raise an alarm flagging it as an anomaly.

One of the major sophisticated threats that happen to be very difficult and challenging to counter due to its distributed nature and resulted in cloud service disruption is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Even though there are number of intrusion detection solutions proposed by different research groups, and cloud service providers (CSP) are currently using different detection solutions by promising that their product is well secured, there is no such a perfect solution that prevents the DDoS attack. The characteristics of DDoS attack, i.e., Having different appearance with different scenarios, make it difficult to detect.

The resultant model shows how the system behaves when a failure condition occurs and acts as a basis model that ensures safety through requirement validation.

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Frequently, malware is hidden into a computer by software components called root kits. Therefore, early detection of root kits is of primary importance to avoid the uncontrolled operation of malware. Most of current techniques for root kit detection only allow a late detection after the malware has already been hidden by a root kit. In this paper, a new technique is presented that enables the proactive detection of root kits while they are hiding malware, and therefore, allowing that hiding can be avoided. The technique has been designed for root kits that operate in kernel-mode. This root kits are particularly difficult to detect because both the detector and the root kit are executed with the same privileges. This technique can be used to improve the detection capabilities of intrusion detection and prevention systems.","","978-1-4577-0979-1","978-0-7695-4485-4","10.1109/ARES.2011.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6045970","Hooking;Malware;Rootkits;Stealth software","Arrays;Kernel;Malware;Monitoring;Resource management","invasive software","computer security;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;kernel-mode rootkit;malicious software;malware;rootkit proactive detection","","1","","16","","","22-26 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After gaining network data package and pattern matching according to the protocol analysis result of primary data, the attack behavior is detected, and the signature database is unceasingly updated by new attack behavior signature. The SSL encryption authentication is used in data package transmission, which can prevent the information leakage and falsifying, and the data remain original.

Univ., Daejeon, South Korea","Advanced Information Networking and Applications, 2006. AINA 2006. 20th International Conference on","20060515","2006","2","","5 pp.","","In this paper, we propose the cluster-based hierarchical time synchronization protocol (CHTS) for wireless sensor networks (WSN). To couple the network with real world tightly, we provide a network-wide time synchronization through the introduction of abstractions for cluster and hierarchy. Generally the error of time synchronization has the tendency of being accumulated as the hop count along the synchronization path increases in multi-hop wireless sensor network. Thus we cluster the randomly deployed nodes to decrease the hop count along the synchronization path. We then apply different optimal synchronization mechanisms to the cluster heads and cluster members for the sake of power efficiency through an explicit broadcast manner.

A technical system exhibits emergence when it has certain kinds of properties or qualities that are irreducible in the sense that they are not traceable to the constituent parts of the system. In particular, we show how emergence in technical systems can be detected and measured gradually using techniques from the field of probability theory and information theory. To detect or measure emergence we observe the system and extract characteristic attributes from those observations. As an extension of earlier work in the field, we propose emergence measures that are well-suited for continuous attributes (or hybrid attribute sets) using either non-parametric or model-based probability density estimation techniques. We also replace the known entropy-based emergence measures by divergence measures for probability densities (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hellinger distance). We discuss advantages and drawbacks of these measures by means of some simulation experiments using artificial data sets and a real-world data set from the field of intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8537-6","978-0-7695-4232-4","10.1109/SASO.2010.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5630529","intelligent technical systems;organic computing;quantitative emergence","Atmospheric measurements;Density measurement;Entropy;Gaussian distribution;Particle measurements;Q measurement;Time measurement","entropy;model-based reasoning;probability;security of data;systems analysis","divergence measure;entropy-based emergence measure;information theory;intrusion detection;model-based probability density estimation;probability theory;quantitative emergence;technical system","","4","","32","","","Sept. 27 2010-Oct. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cyber-physical power system vulnerabilities are increasing and the consequences of attack can be catastrophic. Understanding power system phenomena and attacks is vital to identifying and detecting such events. Researchers require a suitable power system test bed that can provide a platform for simulation of power system events and attacks. An essential part of such a test bed is the ability to provide software and hardware interaction to mimic real world scenarios. This paper presents a test bed for the development of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for power systems. The test bed consists of a power system modeled on a real time digital simulator (RTDS), a data collection and processing engine, and a MATLAB/RSCAD parameter calculation engine. This test bed provides a platform for hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation, power system attacks, and generates data sets required by cyber security researchers. Coordinated distance protection and overcurrent protection schemes are implemented on the IEEE 9 bus system and a 3-generator 4 bus system [11]. Fault, contingency and cyber-attack scenarios have been developed for both power systems. Selected relevant simulation results are presented.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939262","IDS;attacks;contingencies;data;faults;power system;test bed","Circuit faults;Generators;Phasor measurement units;Power system stability;Power transmission lines;Relays","IEEE standards;digital simulation;overcurrent protection;power engineering computing;power system control;power system faults;power system measurement;power system protection;power system security","3-generator 4 bus system;HIL simulation;IDS;IEEE 9 bus system;RTDS;cyber-physical power system;data collection;data processing engine;hardware in the loop simulation;intrusion detection system;overcurrent protection schemes;power system attack simulation;power system control;power system monitoring;power system. operation;power systems.

Twenty-Third Annual","20080102","2007","","","87","96","Progress in insider-threat detection is currently limited by a lack of realistic, publicly available, real-world data. For reasons of privacy and confidentiality, no one wants to expose their sensitive data to the research community. Data can be sanitized to mitigate privacy and confidentiality concerns, but the mere act of sanitizing the data may introduce artifacts that compromise its utility for research purposes. If sanitization artifacts change the results of insider-threat experiments, then those results could lead to conclusions which are not true in the real world. The goal of this work is to investigate the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat detection experiments. We assemble a suite of tools and present a methodology for collecting and sanitizing data. We use these tools and methods in an experimental evaluation of an insider-threat detection system. We compare the results of the evaluation using raw data to the results using each of three types of sanitized data, and we measure the effect of each sanitization strategy. We establish that two of the three sanitization strategies actually alter the results of the experiment. Since these two sanitization strategies are commonly used in practice, we must be concerned about the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat research. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the third sanitization strategy addresses these concerns, indicating that realistic, artifact-free data sets can be created with appropriate tools and methods.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412979","","Application software;Assembly;Banking;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data privacy;Detectors;Laboratories;Postal services","data privacy;security of data","artifact-free data sets;artifact-free insider-threat data;data confidentiality;data privacy;data sanitization artifacts;insider-threat detection;sensitive data","","1","","13","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a starting point in the search for suitable log data by providing a framework for determining exactly which log data that can reveal a specific attack, i.e. the attack manifestations. An attack manifestation consists of the log entries added, changed or removed by the attack compared to normal behaviour. We demonstrate the use of the framework by studying attacks in different types of log data. This work provides a foundation for a fully automated attack analysis. It also provides some pointers for how to define a collection of log elements that are both sufficient and necessary for detection of a specific group of attacks. We believe that this lead to a log data source that is especially adapted for intrusion detection purposes.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377226","Intrusion detection;attack manifestations;data collection;log data","Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Data engineering;Data mining;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Packaging;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;statistical analysis","attack manifestation;intrusion detection;log data requirements","","1","","11","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need for secure data exchange grows rapidly due the fact that the data exchanged are confined to the details of the ailing patient. Recent researchers have proposed a secure system for WBAN, but there is a huge demand to incorporate the security parameters into it. A system in place must ensure security with the use of limited amount of resources. This paper tries to address these issues of security considering the fact of limited availability of resources like power, bandwidth, thereby helping to achieve, more secure and time-efficient system in place for the effective online health monitoring scheme using WBAN. Also the security system for WBAN is proposed with low computational complexity for the secure transaction using a key utilized cryptographic encryption algorithm.","","978-1-4799-2353-3","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921738","Authentication;Encryption;Key Exchange;Security","Authentication;Body area networks;Encryption;Monitoring;Servers","body area networks;medical computing;private key cryptography","WBAN;configuration time;cryptographic encryption algorithm;secure data authentication model;secure data exchange;security parameters;single private key;wireless body area network","","0","","12","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, emerging data intensive applications are increasingly unstructured - irregular in their memory and control flow behavior over massive data sets. While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead. Experiments show that while the CDP implementation can generate potentially 1.13x-2.73x speedup over non-CDP implementations, the non-trivial overhead causes the overall performance an average of 1.21x slowdown.","","978-1-4799-6452-9","","10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983039","","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Parallel processing","graphics processing units;resource allocation;storage management","CUDA dynamic parallelism;coarse-grained blocks;control flow behavior;dynamic parallelism analysis;dynamic parallelism characterization;dynamically formed parallelism;dynamically formed pockets;emerging data intensive applications;fine-grained threads;massive data sets;memory behavior;structured applications;structured data parallelism;unstructured GPU applications;workload balance","","0","","31","","","26-28 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Every professional knows that the only way to secure completely a private network is to make it unreachable. However, even if this solution was undertaken for many years, nowadays it is not possible to close private network especially for business purpose. Thus security management becomes an important issue that must be considered carefully. This research concentrates on one particular aspect: where the networks becomes more complex (number of machines, number of users, number of connections....), making them more vulnerable to various kinds of complex security attacks. Therefore the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) require more advanced models to deal with these requirements. Multi-agent system (MAS) is suggested to provide powerful for the modeling and development of complex systems for detecting attacks. This can be done by depending on decomposition of the system into several interacting and autonomous entities called agents. Agent is an entity functions continuously an autonomously in an environment in which other processes take place and other agents exist","","0-7803-9521-2","","10.1109/ICTTA.2006.1684990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1684990","","Availability;Complex networks;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Multiagent systems;Power system modeling;Problem-solving;Protection","Internet;multi-agent systems;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","Internet;intelligent agent;intrusion detection system;multiagent system;network security management;private network;security attacks;telecommunication network","","0","","3","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
