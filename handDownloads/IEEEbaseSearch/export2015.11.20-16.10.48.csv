In blackhole attack, an intruder captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and not able to reach destination causing high end-to-end delay and low throughput. Previously little amount of work is done for detection and prevention of the Blackhole attack in the WSN making its detection and prevention very crucial as per network performance is concerned.

In this work, an attempt is made to design an intrusion detection model based on the probabilistic approach, first-order Markov chain process, to effectively detection and predict network intrusions. As a first step, the states are defined using clustering techniques for the network traffic profiles; secondly state transition probability matrix and initial probability distribution are determined based on the states defined. Based on the network states, the probability of event occurrence is stochastically measured if the value is lesser than the predefined probability then it event is predicted as anomaly. The proposed probabilistic model performance is evaluated through experiments using KDD Cup99 dataset. The proposed models achieve better detection rate while the attacks are detected in levels of stages.","","978-1-4799-8466-4","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229705","First - Order Markov Chain Process;Intrusion Detection System;Probabilistic Approach;State Transition Matrix","Internet;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Telecommunication traffic","Markov processes;data integrity;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;probability;security of data;telecommunication traffic","FOMC technique;KDD Cup99 dataset;clustering techniques;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;first order Markov chain process;initial probability distribution;intrusion detection model design;network traffic profiles;probabilistic model performance;state transition probability matrix","","0","","16","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is developed to identify these network attacks by a set of rules. However, searching for multiple patterns is a computationally expensive task in NIDS. Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance. The first technique performs the w-byte suffix pattern match instead of using w-byte prefix. The second technique finds the matching results from all groups rather than first group.

These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces ""noise"" due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process. This study suggests that unless an accurate and robust flow classification process is in place, automatic syntactic-based signature generators are vulnerable to such noise injection attacks","1081-6011","0-7695-2574-1","","10.1109/SP.2006.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623998","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Noise generators;Noise level;Noise robustness;Pollution;Protection","invasive software","Polygraph;automatic syntactic-based signature generators;flow classifier;honeynet;imprecision inflow classification;intrusion detection system;misleading worm signature generators;noise injection attacks;robust flow classification;suspicious flows;syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators","","16","6","28","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, unlike existing OSD tools which are completely ad hoc, our approach is formal and follows the principles of diagnosis problem solving. This formalism allows us to: (a) characterize the complexity of OSD; (b) use well-tested algorithms and (c) benefit from numerous possible extensions.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent. We have also developed a prototype active splitter on an IXP1200 network processor and show that the cost of the proposed approach is reasonable.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593585","Network-level security and protection;intrusion detection and prevention.;network processors","Costs;Filtering;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Protocols;Prototypes;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","buffer storage;distributed sensors;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security","active splitter architecture;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;load distribution;load-balancing traffic splitter;locality buffering;memory access locality;network processor;network-level protection;network-level security","","19","","39","","","Jan.-March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The aim of this paper is to detail the employment of EWMA and Fibonacci forecasting techniques covering three major gaps of current prediction techniques concerning UIT: sensors employment, the use of just one prediction technique and forecasts' sharing. A proof of concept of such architecture is presented, which allows concluding about the improvement in forecasts for IDS to deal with UIT.","","978-1-4244-7572-8","","10.1109/ICDIM.2010.5664238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664238","","Employment;Forecasting;Internet;Prototypes;Random access memory;Security;Sensors","Fibonacci sequences;Internet;security of data","EWMA;Fibonacci sequence;Return on Security Investment;cooperative architecture;forecast sharing;information system availability;information system reliability;intrusion detection;intrusion forecasting system;intrusion threat;prediction technique;sensor employment;system protection;unwanted Internet traffic","","2","","42","","","5-8 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, we explorer a novel scheme: WBIPS (WTLS-Based IPS) model. In this mode, a logical sole path is built between every wireless terminal and its destination, so an IPS engine can detect and prevent the traffics of user.

"An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis","Xinming Ou; Rajagopalan, S.R.; Sakthivelmurugan, S.","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2009. ACSAC '09. Annual","20100115","2009","","","494","503","Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3919-5","","10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706","intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;security of data","Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty","","3","","22","","","7-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One example is the filtering-and-refinement approach, a new general two stage technique for more efficient and effective anomaly detection. This paper will try to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the classical techniques presented but as we will see the results are completely dependent on the data sets that are analyzed. We will emphasize on efficiency, robustness and accuracy. We will also try to demonstrate a hybrid approach obtained by combining the filtering-and-refinement method with the DBSCAN algorithm.

However, the available amount of main memory on the system limits the maximum size of the dictionary supported by the string matching solution. To counter that, we propose a technique that employs compressed Aho-Corasick automata to perform fast, exact multi-pattern string matching with very large dictionaries. Our technique achieves the remarkable compression factors of 1:34 and 1:58, respectively, on the memory representation of English-language dictionaries and random binary string dictionaries. We demonstrate a parallel implementation for the Cell processor that delivers a sustained throughput between 0.90 and 2.35 Gbps per Cell blade, while supporting dictionary sizes up to 9.2 Million average patterns per Gbyte of main memory, and exhibiting resilience to content-based attacks.

Evading these attacks has created a lot of attention from researchers. A number of monitoring and filtering devices have been developed to verify the authenticity of the packets based on the packet payload data in intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the methods used for IDS cannot be deployed in DDoS filters since in DDoS attacks, a lot of packets arrive in a short span of time and deriving packet payload patterns become cumbersome with these IDS algorithms. This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm. This three-level filter was tested in the ANTS active network tool kit with the 1999 DARPA IDS dataset as the back end. Results validate the proposed scheme's efficiency and the time complexity of the filter proposed is smaller than IDS payload scanning methodologies.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809140","ANTS;Anomaly detection;Distributed Denial of Service attack;Eigen Vector;Payload modeling;String matching","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Filtering;Filters;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;message authentication;string matching;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;active network;distributed denial-of-service attack;eigen vector;flooding attack;intrusion detection system;optimal string matching algorithm;packet authenticity;packet payload data;payload driven security model","","1","1","11","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In past years many algorithms are created to extract knowledge from large sets of data. There are many different methodologies to approach data mining: classification, clustering, association rule, etc. Classification is the most conventional technique to analyse the large data sets. Classification can help identify intrusions, as well as for discovering new and unknown types of intrusions.

Proceedings IEEE","20050822","2005","4","","2372","2382 vol. 4","Client puzzles have been proposed in a number of protocols as a mechanism for mitigating the effects of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","14","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses a method for accelerating the network policing using node capabilities. Presently network monitoring requires the hardware component regeneration tap for packet duplication and this component needs to be present in several network points. The above tap will do un-conditional packet duplication which is in-efficient. This also makes the analyzing devices do overwork in inspecting the packets. This paper thus brings out some of the in-efficiencies in the existing network monitoring systems and justifies an alternate method for doing the same. It presents a suggestive fresh view on the factors that could prove instrumental in improving monitoring of enterprise data networks by re-using some of the forwarding capabilities in the network nodes.

The requirement for high throughput and high level of reconfiguration together put Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology into the focus of high performance networking. In this paper, we introduce a programmable, multi-purpose network platform called C-GEP that is based on a reconfigurable architecture. The system consists of two main building blocks: a high performance FPGA-based custom hardware platform and a firmware dedicated for network monitoring.

In this paper, we introduce four different schemes of attribute normalization to preprocess the data for anomaly intrusion detection. Three methods, k-NN, PCA as well as SVM, are then employed on the normalized data for comparison of the detection results. KDD Cup 1999 data are used to evaluate the normalization schemes and the detection methods.

But it often lacks global cooperative capability. When facing attacks, e.g., DDoS, an intrusion detection system (IDS) needs an overall scheme to respond properly. Also, Internet consists of network management units (NMUs). It would be better if several nearby surrounding NMUs can collaboratively guard and protect their important surrounded neighbor. In this article, we propose an intrusion forecast and traceback system (IFTS) based on union defense environment. IFTS monitors network forwarding traffic, thus forecasting malicious behaviors for its neighbor NMD, called protected NMU (P-NMU). With forecasting, P-NMU can predetermine the way to treat the intrusion packets. IFTS deploys a hash-based intrusion traceback subsystem to trace intruders.","1521-9097","0-7695-2281-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2005.170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531202","","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer science;IP networks;Injuries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;Internet;P-NMU;global cooperative capability;intrusion forecast;intrusion packet;intrusion traceback subsystem;network intrusion detection;network management units;network traffic;network-based intrusion detection system;protected NMU;traceback system;union defense environment","","2","","14","","","20-22 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The accuracy of traditional static methods of correlation is however limited in large-scale complex systems, where the degree of human insight and validation necessary is higher, and dynamic attack behaviours are likely. Many recent efforts have centred around visualising security data in a way that can better involve and support a human analyst in the network security triage process but this potentially gives rise to another complex system of analytical and visual components which need to be configured, trained and understood. This paper describes an agent-based framework designed to manage a set of visual analytic components in order to improve a security analyst's understanding and ability to classify the threats to the network that they govern. In the proof-of-concept system an agent selects the most effective method for event aggregation, given a particular set of events which have been generated by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). We present a novel application of a dynamic response model in order to configure the aggregation component such that the data is best simplified for more effective further analysis.","","978-1-4673-2624-7","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384968","Agent-based;Alert Correlation;Intrusion Alert Analysis","Correlation;Data mining;Data visualization;Educational institutions;Security;Visual analytics","multi-agent systems;security of data","IDS;analytical components;intrusion alert analysis;intrusion detection system;network intrusion;security data;static methods;visual analytic agent based framework;visual components","","0","","23","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Successful attacks have lead to some organizations experiencing financial difficulties or even being forced out of business. Organizations have insufficient tools to detect and respond to attacks on web applications, since traditional security logs have gaps that make attack reconstruction nearly impossible.

In recent years we have experienced a wave of DDoS attacks threatening the welfare of the Internet. These are launched by malicious users whose pure incentive is to degrade the performance of other, innocent, users. The traditional systems turn out to be quite vulnerable to these attacks. The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then evaluate the commonly used data structure in network mechanisms, the hash data structure, using our vulnerability metric. We show that a Closed Hash is much more vulnerable than an Open Hash to DDoS attacks, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent via traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queueing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems. Lastly we apply it to the practical case of a hash table whose requests are controlled by a queue, showing that even after the attack has ended, the regular users still suffer from performance degradation or even a total denial of service.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509893","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Data structures;Degradation;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web server","Internet;data structures;queueing theory;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;distributed denial of service;hash data structure;queueing mechanism","","6","","15","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2906-4","","10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466310","Intrusion Detection System;K-means Clustering;Neuro-fuzzy;Radial Support Vector Machine","","Internet;data mining;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","BPNN;Columbia model;IDS building;Internet;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;SVM classifier;business Web application;data mining technique;decision tree;detection accuracy;financial Web application;fuzzy neural network;intrusion detection system;intrusion detection technique;k-means clustering;network security;neuro-fuzzy model;radial SVM classification;radial basis support vector machine;sensitivity;specificity","","5","","23","","","4-6 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve the speed and the storage-efficiency, complex regexs are decomposed into simpler subexpressions, where each subexpression can fire one or more instructions. Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

However, traditional intrusion detection systems for the IT domain are not entirely suitable for industrial process automation. In this paper, multiple models are constructed by comprehensively analyzing the multidomain knowledge of field control layers in industrial process automation, with consideration of two aspects: physics and information. And then, a novel multimodel-based anomaly intrusion detection system with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination for the field control system in industrial process automation is designed. In the system, an anomaly detection based on multimodel is proposed, and the corresponding intelligent detection algorithms are designed. Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of anomaly detection, a classifier based on an intelligent hidden Markov model, is designed to differentiate the actual attacks from faults. Finally, based on a combination simulation platform using optimized performance network engineering tool, the detection accuracy and the real-time performance of the proposed intrusion detection system are analyzed in detail. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed system has good performance in terms of high precision and good real-time capability.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2415763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081762","Anomaly intrusion detection;hidden Markov model (HMM);industrial process automation;multimodel;security","Automation;Control systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Process control;Protocols","control engineering computing;data protection;digital simulation;hidden Markov models;optimisation;pattern classification;process control;security of data","PCS;anomaly intrusion detection system;classifier design;combination simulation platform;field control system;hidden Markov model;industrial process automation;intelligent detection algorithm;multidomain knowledge;performance network engineering tool optimization;process control system;security protection;security risk","","0","","50","","2015-04-08","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To extract the normal behavior as a profile, conventional data mining techniques are widely applied to a finite audit data set. However, these approaches can only model the static behavior of a user in the audit data set. This drawback can be overcome by viewing the continuous activities of a user as an audit data stream. This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm, which continuously models a data stream. A set of features is used to represent the characteristics of an activity. For each feature, the clusters of feature values corresponding to activities observed so far in an audit data stream are identified by the proposed clustering algorithm for data streams. As a result, without maintaining any historical activity of a user physically, new activities of the user can be continuously reflected to the on-going result of clustering.","","0-7695-2297-1","","10.1109/SERA.2005.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563165","","Clustering algorithms;Communications technology;Computer crime;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Security;Virtual manufacturing","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;audit data set;data mining techniques;data stream clustering","","1","1","17","","","11-13 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging.

Yet, the current network security mechanisms are passive in response to network-based intrusions. In order to hide their origins, intruders usually use incorrect or spoofed source IP addresses breaking into targets. It is difficult to identify the real source of these network-based intrusions due to the nature of the IP protocol. This paper presents the design of distributed intrusion source identification system (DISIS) based on agents. It is comprised of several agents of different types, which can be developed respectively. The agents communicate with each other when they take their actions. DISIS can cooperate with any other intrusion detection system. This system can be installed in router or a dedicated device connected to router.

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes. The classification rate of above 99% is obtained.

For high dimensional data, feature selection can find the information-rich feature subset, thus enhance the classification accuracy and efficiency. Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy).

Empirical studies show that as the rule set grows larger, power consumption and delay time for processing IP Packets particularly on Hardware firewalls increases extremely, and, therefore the performance of the firewall decreases proportionally. This paper present a new FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) based firewall with high performance, high processing speed, low power consumption, and low space utilization in contrast with early submitted paper in some of credible international conferences. First of all, we use Embedded Memories of FPGA instead of external memories, to increase the processing speed and to decrease the mass of signaling and noise creation in connection between FPGA and external memories. Moreover, we have applied pipeline technique to the architecture, and so we achieved high processing speed in addition to low power consumption. Based on this model, only the security rules are updated by admin during the configuration process while other hardware part would remain unchanged. The proposed architecture is written in VHDL standard language and it is simulated and synthesized with ALTERA QUARTUS II software. Finally, for validation of proposed architecture, we implemented the synthesized code on 3 of ALTERA FPGAs families (STRATIX III, CYCLONE III, CYCLONE II), and then results have been compared with earlier results.","","978-1-4244-8862-9","978-0-9564263-6-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678545","","Fires;Hardware;Pipelines;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Registers;Synchronization","IP networks;authorisation;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","ALTERA QUARTUS II software;FPGA;IP packet;SOC;VHDL;configuration process;field programmable gate array;hardware firewall implementation;pipeline technique;power consumption","","0","","17","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is, therefore, expected to be a key component in many telecommunication and Internet services. For example, the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem relies heavily on SIP. Given its critical role, ensuring the security of SIP is clearly a crucial task. In this paper, we analyze the SIP protocol and show that it can easily be exploited to mount effective and large-scale botnets. We do this by scrutinizing the details of the SIP protocol and show how it offers a variety of ways to conceal botnet traffic within legitimate-looking SIP traffic. Using our analysis, we implement a SIP bot and present experimental results from a real testbed network.

Finally, we present a software tool (called autosip) to generate synthetic traffic that resembles actual SIP traffic with different controllable characteristics.

Based on the position of the victim in the network, our scheme selects only a small fraction of routers to monitor the traffic and identify packets that bear signatures of the attack packets. From the information provided by these chosen routers, the network is pruned and another set of routers is chosen to identify the source of attack, until the source router is detected.

This type of computation falls under the category of Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). The solution to SMC problems in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) can be found with the modification of the data inputs or with some anonymization technique. MANETs are the wireless networks of the mobile computing devices with no support of any fixed infrastructure. The mobile nodes use any of the radio technology like Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 or Hiperlan for directly communicating with each other. The nodes behave as hosts as well as routers. The security challenges in the MANET arise due to its dynamic topology, vulnerable wireless link and nomadic environment. An identification mechanism is needed between the nodes using identification and the credentials. This security architecture simultaneously leads to privacy problems. Some mechanism is needed which prevents a node to learn the identity or the credentials of other nodes. To provide location privacy in MANET is a nontrivial task. Current routing protocols do not focus much on the security and the privacy issues. These aspects are postponed till further development. An authentication protocol is needed between nodes using some cryptographic technique. In service-oriented MANET the denial of the service must be taken care of so that the availability of the service is maintained. The security requirement of the ad hoc network depends on its application. For example, for a simple business meeting the requirement is mitigated and for the military battlefield it is severe. Thus no general security architecture can be developed for MANET. Specific security architecture is needed for specific application. Much security related work is still pending and will add to the standards as the physical deployment of the MANET will grow. In this paper, an empha- - sis is made on how SMC solutions can be used for privacy preservation during computation.","","978-1-4244-7203-1","","10.1109/WOCN.2010.5587317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587317","MANET;Privacy;Secure Multiparty Computation;Security","Ad hoc networks;Aggregates;Computational modeling;Irrigation;Mobile computing;Presses;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;mobile computing;mobile radio;routing protocols","MANET;SMC;authentication protocol;cryptographic technique;distributed computing device;mobile ad hoc network;mobile computing devices;privacy preservation;secure multiparty computation;security architecture;wireless network","","5","","16","","","6-8 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Grid-specific attacks are different from traditional ones, and traditional HIDS can not recognize a grid user and always with high performance overhead. This paper proposes a grid-specific host-based intrusion detection system (GHIDS) which employs bottleneck verification approach to detect intrusions with low false alarm rate and high detection rate. Working within operating system kernel and performing bottleneck verification by integer comparison, GHIDS achieves high efficiency and accuracy. Security reports generated by GHIDS are indexed not only by local user ID, but also by grid user ID. That is more useful for analyzing grid user behaviors globally by both host administrators and high level grid-based IDS","","0-7695-2751-5","","10.1109/APSCC.2006.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041283","","Data security;Grid computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Mesh generation;Middleware;Military computing;Operating systems;Protection;Resource management","grid computing;operating system kernels;security of data","bottleneck verification;computational grid;grid user behavior analysis;grid-specific attack;grid-specific host-based intrusion detection system;integer comparison;operating system kernel;shared resource protection","","5","","15","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Symposium on","20081117","2005","","","105","113","New network applications like intrusion detection systems and packet-level accounting require multi-match packet classification, where all matching filters need to be reported. Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multi-match classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAM is expensive and consumes large amounts of power. None of the previously published multi-match classification schemes is both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new Set Splitting Algorithm (SSA). The main idea of SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least half the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: MUD [1] and Geometric Intersection- based solutions [2]. Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75% to 95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with Geometric Intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet.","","978-1-59593-082-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675270","TCAM;energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Indexes;Matched filters;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;power aware computing;security of data;telecommunication network routing","geometric intersection-based solutions;intrusion detection systems;matching filters;memory efficient scheme;multimatch packet classification;network applications;packet-level accounting;parallel matching;power consumption;power efficient scheme;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memories","","0","","29","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective is that the proposed modelling approach can be used in different applications areas where monitoring of sequential activities is involved. As an experimental case, the proposed modelling approach is applied in part of network intrusion detection where intrusions and legitimate network traffic is modelled using the approach.

A trusted VMM (TVMM) based platform can provide stronger security protection for group signature systems than traditional computing platforms can. The authors first introduce a TVMM-based group signature architecture and a TVMM security protection mechanism for group signature components.

One of the best-known anomaly detectors used in intrusion detection is stide. (Rather than STIDE or Stide or s-tide, we have chosen ""stide"" in keeping with the way the detector was referred to in the paper by Warrender et al., 1999.) Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, ""why six?"" accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may (not) be appropriate. This paper addresses the ""why six"" issue by presenting an evaluation framework for mapping out stide's effective operating space and by identifying conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values. In addition, results of an investigation are presented, comparing stide's anomaly-detection capabilities with those of a competing detector.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.806130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159659","","Blindness;Change detection algorithms;Computer security;Detectors;Embedded computing;Immune system;Information security;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Solids","computer viruses","anomaly-based intrusion detector;data sequences;detection blindness;detection capability;information security;intrusion detection;masqueraders;novel attacks;operational limits;root privileges;sequence lengths;stide","","24","","13","","","Jan 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
