Given the types of a few sensor nodes, it extracts sensor nodes' preferences related with the known types of malicious node, establishes the sample space of all sensor nodes that participate in network activities. Then, according to the study on the type-known sensor nodes' samples based on the multivariate classification algorithm, a classifier is generated, and all of the unknown-type sensor nodes are classified.

This paper studies the role of alarm reduction and correlation in supporting the security administrator in an enterprise network. We present an architecture that incorporates intrusion detection systems as sensors, and provides improved alarm data to the human operator or to automated actuators.

Network attacks results in massive amount of loss in terms of money, reputation and data confidentiality. Reducing or eliminating the negative effects of any intrusion is a fundamental issue of network security. The network security problem can be represented as a game between the attacker or intruder and the network administrator where both the players try to attain maximum outcome. The network administrator tries to defend the attack and the attacker tries to overcome it and attack the system. Thus network security can be enforced using game theoretic approach.

"A rapid deployment guided radar sensor","Harman, K.; Hodgins, B.; Patchell, J.; Maki, M.","Senstar Corp., Carp, ON, Canada","Security Technology, 2009. 43rd Annual 2009 International Carnahan Conference on","20091113","2009","","","232","238","A need has long existed for a rapid deployment, terrain following security sensor for use around portable resources, along an avenue of approach, or for the temporary replacement of a failed sensor. Existing solutions such as portable microwave or passive infra-red (PIR) sensors are relatively inexpensive, but cannot work over uneven terrain, around corners, or in foliage. The cost and installation complexity of these sensors increases rapidly as more units are required. The Repels<sup>reg</sup> RF sensor provides many of the required features, but uses sensor cables that are overtly mounted above ground. The OmniTrax<sup>reg</sup> technology was first introduced at the 2004 Carnahan Conference, applying ultra wide band radar principles to a ranging leaky cable guided radar sensor. In 2007, a program called TFDIDS (terrain following deployable intrusion detection sensor) was initiated in conjunction with the US Air Force, to apply the advancements in this ranging technology to the rapid deployment sensor needs defined by the USAF tactical automated sensor system (TASS). This advancement includes a novel invention employing the processing of dual parallel leaky sensor cables, termed Stereo OmniTrax. This processing dramatically improves the discrimination between human intrusion threats and small nuisance targets or environmental effects. The TFDIDS system provides a complete lightweight sensor kit for the rapid deployment (less than 30 minutes) of a 100 m detection zone, and later, for the sensor's retrieval and reuse. TFDIDS interfaces to standard Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) including USAF powering and communications devices. This paper outlines the key elements of the TFDIDS design, describes its components, and explains how TFDIDS provides reliable detection using a surface sensor cable deployment. Initial performance results are presented, from tests conducted at the Senstar SITE in 2008. The test applications include through-the-woods, on tarmac and o- n typical open field surfaces.","","978-1-4244-4169-3","978-1-4244-4170-9","10.1109/CCST.2009.5335532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5335532","Rapid deployment perimeter security sensor;border security;leaky cable sensor;rapid deployment;sensor field testing;terrainfollowing deployable intrusion detection system;ultra wideband radar","Cables;Costs;Infrared sensors;Microwave sensors;Radio frequency;Security;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Testing;Ultra wideband radar","infrared detectors;military radar;ultra wideband radar","OmniTrax<sup>reg</sup> technology;RF sensor;Stereo OmniTrax;TFDIDS design;US Air Force;USAF tactical automated sensor system;deployable intrusion detection sensor;dual parallel leaky sensor cables;radar sensor;security sensor;standard Government furnished equipment;ultrawide band radar principles","","0","","4","","","5-8 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current ""attacker centric"" approach researches mainly focus on single attacker centric behavior analysis, while overlooking the impact of the attacker's cooperative relationship on attack behavior analysis. This paper is mainly coping with such scenarios. In this paper, the basic concept and methods of attack behavior tracking and analysis is introduced. As a key technique, the principles of choosing desirable attacker set are discussed, the concepts of attacker group and group member are introduced, and a simple algorithm of attacker group recognition is proposed. Finally, a prototype system based on the proposed approaches is evaluated under DARPA 2000 intrusion detection evaluation datasets.

The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32%, giving a 8% increase in sensor performance, while locality buffers improve sensor performance by about 10%.

Since it is not technically feasible to build a system with no vulnerabilities, intrusion detection has become an important area of research. The neuro-fuzzy intrusion detection system (NFIDS) is an anomaly based intrusion detection system that uses fuzzy logic and neural networks to detect if malicious activity is taking place on a network. This paper describes the architecture of the NFIDS and its components. The sample fuzzy rules are developed for some kinds of attacks and the testing results with actual network data are described.","","0-7803-8163-7","","10.1109/ICECS.2003.1302048","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302048","","Authorization;Computer networks;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Particle measurements;Pattern recognition","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;fuzzy logic;fuzzy neural nets;telecommunication security","NFIDS;anomaly based intrusion detection system;authorization;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rules;malicious network activity;neural networks;neuro-fuzzy intrusion detection system;remote Internet attacks;worldwide connectivity","","3","","9","","","14-17 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is mainly coping with such issues. In this paper, the framework of attacker centric behavior analysis is proposed. As key technique, the principles of choosing desirable attacker set are discussed, the concepts of attacker group and group member are introduced, and the corresponding attacker group recognition algorithms are also proposed.

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, widespread usage over UDP, limited use of encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level to launch denial of service attacks. To mitigate this, self- learning systems have been proposed to detect anomalous SIP messages and filter them. However, previous works use datasets with large differences between the normal and anomalous message. This gives high performance for existing classification systems, including those based on Euclidean distances. We present our analysis on a new dataset that has minimal difference between normal and anomalous messages. Our findings indicate that existing classification schemes behave unsatisfactorily on our dataset. We demonstrate why this is the case by statistical analysis of our dataset, and furthermore, present feature reduction techniques to enhance the classification performance of existing classification schemes on our dataset.","2157-4952","978-1-4244-8705-9","978-1-4244-8703-5","10.1109/NTMS.2011.5720662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720662","","Computer crime;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms","Internet;cryptographic protocols;message authentication;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;statistical analysis","Euclidean distance;Internet;anomalous message;anomaly detection;classification system;encryption;feature reduction technique;multimedia session establishment protocol;self learning system;session initiation protocol;statistical analysis","","8","","20","","","7-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The obfuscation was performed by tunneling the malicious traffic in HTTP and HTTPS protocols with the intention of simulating the usual legitimate characteristics of the HTTP traffic's flow. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities of four services were used: Samba, BadBlue, Apache, DCOM RPC. Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks. Data mining analysis was performed by using both bi-nominal and poly-nominal classifications, resulting into better performance of poly-nominal classification. At the summary, we emphasize the necessity of training the statistically and behaviorally based NBAs with divergent obfuscation techniques to strengthen their detection capabilities.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038827","IDS;NBA;buffer overflow;network vulnerabilities;protocol tunneling;traffic obfuscation","Buffer overflows;Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;data mining;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","AIPS;ASNM network features;Apache;BadBlue;DCOM RPC;HTTP protocols;HTTP secure protocol;HTTPS protocols;HTTPS traffic;IDS;NBA;SNORT detection;SNORT network features;Samba;advanced security network metrics;automated intrusion prevention system;binominal classification;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;classification accuracy;data mining analysis;hyper text transfer protocol;legitimate traffic simulations;obfuscated network buffer overflow attacks detection properties;obfuscated network vulnerability exploitation;polynominal classification;virtual network environment","","0","","30","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the conventional IPS deployment often has some limitations, and the deployment and maintenance costs are expensive, the utilization rate is low. In order to solve these issues, an SDN-based IPS deployment is presented in this paper, which supports a unified scheduling of security applications in the whole network and load balancing among IPSs. In addition, this paper builds a test-bed and shows evaluation results.

Currently, ISPs over-provision capacity in order to meet QoS demands from customers. Software-Defined Networking and OpenFlow allow for better network control and flexibility in the pursuit of operating networks as efficiently as possible. Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy. We show that not only local links serving variable bit-rate video streams, but also aggregated WAN links benefit from an adaptive polling rate to obtain accurate measurements. Furthermore, we verify throughput, delay and packet loss measurements for bursty scenarios in our experiment testbed.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838228","","Bandwidth;Control systems;Delays;Monitoring;Packet loss;Throughput","computer network performance evaluation;software radio","OpenFlow software-defined networks;OpenNetMon:;QoS parameters;aggregated WAN links;fine-grained traffic engineering;network monitoring;variable bit-rate video stream","","12","","21","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computers are integral part of everyday operations. Organizations depend on them. A computer failure will have a critical impact on the organization. The term “Security” brings to mind all shorts of issues that refer to data protection and prevention of unauthorised access. The common motives for computer crimes could be lure for money, revenge, terrorism, fun, recognition or curiosity. Information systems can be attacked by outsiders who may penetrate a computer system or by insiders who are authorised to use the resources but misuse their authorization. An attacker may disrupt the information system of an organization (active attack) or gain access to its sensitive information (passive attack). Although no direct damage is done in a passive attack, any leak in information could have drastic repercussions for the organization. In simple words, security can be defined as: protecting information system from intended access. The goal of network management is to provide users with a quality of service. To meet this goal, network services plan involve strategic and technical planning of engineering, operations and maintenance of the network. The field of network security and management is constantly undergoing changes in technology, applications and hence the need for continually changing skills set on the part of academics. We will try to cover the various points with respect to organizational structure, policies and techniques of network security and management.

Various intrusion detection technologies are widely used to solve this problem. In those technologies, the pattern matching based on knowledge is the most popular technology. It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way. It plays an essential role in the efficiency of intrusion detection system. As network speed and capacity is growing rapid, it is necessary to improve the algorithm of pattern matching to follow the currency.

"A novel adaptive intrusion detection approach based on comparison of neural networks and idiotypic networks","Linhui Zhao; Xin Fang; Yaping Dai","Sch. of Mechatron., Beijing Union Univ., Beijing, China","Nonlinear Dynamics and Synchronization, 2009. INDS '09. 2nd International Workshop on","20090901","2009","","","203","208","Although neural networks and idiotypic networks are similar in functions, they are different in many aspects. This paper compares them in topological structures, initializing ways, learning methods, et al. Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved. Thirdly, clone expansion of antibodies is suppressed by idiotypic effects, thus false positive rate is decreased. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this adaptive detection approach. Compared with the detection approach based on a multilayer perception network, the false positive rate is decreased and the detection accuracy of unknown attacks is increased.","1866-7791","978-1-4244-3844-0","","10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228006","idiotypic networks;intrusion detection;neural networks;pattern recognition","Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Learning systems;Mechatronics;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Pattern recognition","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","Fisher Iris dataset;KDD-CUP-99 database;adaptive detection approach;adaptive intrusion detection approach;antigens;idiotypic networks;initializing ways;learning methods;multilayer perception network;neural networks;pattern recognition technology;topological structures","","5","","11","","","20-21 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Psyco-Virt architecture includes a cluster of virtual machines, the monitored VMs, which run the OS and applications of interest, and a further VM, the introspection one. Several agents distributed across the monitored VMs execute network and host IDS tools to discover attempted intrusions/attacks on the monitored VMs. The introspection VM makes the detection tools trustworthy by running an introspector and a director to discover any attempt to maliciously modify the kernel, the agents and the IDSes hosted on a monitored VM. On each monitored VM a collector gathers the alerts generated by the agents and forwards them to the director through a control network dedicated to data exchange among the agents and the introspection VM. The director on the introspection VM filters all the alerts and delegates the execution of a proper action to a notifier whenever an intrusion or an attempt to modify the IDSes is detected. In such cases, a monitored VM can either be stopped or frozen and its current state saved in a file for a later, deeper inspection.

In order to aggregate the massive alert data effectively and identify important security events accurately, we propose an improved Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm based on Similarity Radius (SR-ISODATA). In the presented algorithm, optimal sequence comparison method is used to calculate the attribute weight of alert data, and different similarity calculation methods are chosen due to different properties of alert data; the merging and splitting criteria are revised, the clustering center in the original ISODATA algorithm is replaced by the average similarity radius and the distance calculation in the original algorithm is replaced by the similarity.

The WSN nodes communicate with each other. WSN devices have various resource constraints such as less memory, low clock speed, finite battery energy, and limited computational power. It may not be feasible to replace the batteries in the WSN nodes. As all the nodes are battery operated it is necessary to conserve the limited battery energy so that the lifetime of the network can be extended. Network lifetime, energy efficiency, load balancing and more over scalability are some key requirements of WSN applications. This work presents a multi level hierarchical routing protocol, which is based on the LEACH protocol. This protocol improves both the energy efficiency and the lifetime of the network. Two-level LEACH (TL-LEACH), Three-level LEACH (3L-LEACH) and Four-level LEACH (4L-LEACH) have been presented.

Due to dynamic nature and lack of centralized monitoring points, these networks are highly vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) provide audit and monitoring capabilities that offer the local security to a node and help to perceive the specific trust level of other nodes. We take benefit of the clustering concept in MANETs for the effective communication between nodes, where each cluster involves a number of member nodes and is managed by a cluster-head. It can be taken as an advantage in these battery and memory constrained networks for the purpose of intrusion detection, by separating tasks for the head and member nodes, at the same time providing opportunity for launching collaborative detection approach. The clustering schemes are generally used for the routing purposes to enhance the route efficiency. However, the effect of change of a cluster tends to change the route; thus degrades the performance. This paper presents a low-overhead clustering algorithm for the benefit of detecting intrusion rather than efficient routing. It also discusses the intrusion detection techniques with the help of this simplified clustering scheme.","","978-0-7803-9442-1","978-0-7803-9442-1","10.1109/SCONEST.2005.4382879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4382879","Ad hoc networks;clustering scheme;election process;intrusion detection","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Collaboration;Communication effectiveness;Communication system security;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET;collaborative detection approach;emergency rescue services;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;overhead clustering algorithm;route efficiency;wireless networks","","2","","11","","","27-27 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The major concern of this paper is to extend the main idea of the SVDD for the problem of pattern de-noising. Combining the projection onto the spherical decision boundary resulting from the SVDD together with a solver for the pre-image problem, we propose a new method for pattern de-noising. In the proposed method, we first solve the SVDD for the training data, then for each noisy test pattern, perform de-noising by projecting its feature vector onto the decision boundary on the feature space, and finally find the location of the de-noised pattern by obtaining the pre-image of the projection.

Accordingly, we pose the evaluation and the deployment problems; the former is to evaluate the new coverage measure of a given sensor network, and the latter is to find an optimal placement of k additional sensor nodes to improve the coverage for a given positive integer k. We present several algorithms solving the problems that are either centralized or localized with theoretical proofs and simulation results, showing that our algorithms are efficient and easy to implement in practice while the quality of outputs is guaranteed by formal proofs. Our algorithms are based on an interesting relation between our new coverage measure and a certain quantity of a point set, called the bottleneck, which has been relatively well studied in other disciplines.

SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence.

"High performance string matching algorithm for a network intrusion prevention system (NIPS)","Weinsberg, Y.; Tzur-David, S.; Dolev, D.; Anker, T.","Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem","High Performance Switching and Routing, 2006 Workshop on","20061016","2006","","","7 pp.","","Intrusion detection systems (IDS) were developed to identify and report attacks in the late 1990s, as hacker attacks and network worms began to affect the Internet. Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed of several orders of magnitude faster than current works, while attaining similar accuracy of detection. Furthermore, our system is fully compatible with Snort's rules syntax, which is the de facto standard for intrusion prevention systems","","0-7803-9569-7","","10.1109/HPSR.2006.1709697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709697","","Associative memory;Computer hacking;Delay;Heart;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Wire","content-addressable storage;security of data;string matching;telecommunication traffic","IDS;NIPS;Snort's rules syntax;TCAM;intrusion detection system;legitimate traffic;network intrusion prevention system;pattern-matching algorithm;string matching algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","16","4","18","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies the effectiveness of two approaches in handling nominal features: a simple coding scheme via the use of indicator variables and a scaling method based on multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). In particular, we apply the techniques with two anomaly detection methods: the principal component classifier (PCC) and the Canberra metric. The experiments with KDD 1999 data demonstrate that MCA works better than the indicator variable approach for both detection methods with the PCC coming much ahead of the Canberra metric.","1097-8585","0-7695-2390-0","","10.1109/RIDE.2005.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498231","Anomaly detection;indicator variables;intrusion detection;multiple correspondence analysis;nominal features;principal component classifier","Application software;Computer networks;Computer science;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer network management;data mining;principal component analysis;security of data","Canberra metric;KDD 1999 data;anomaly intrusion detection problems;computer network data stream;data type;indicator variables;multiple correspondence analysis;nominal features;principal component classifier;simple coding scheme;symbolic features","","8","","27","","","3-4 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The data produced by the sensors in this infrastructure is collected and stored in three distinct formats: relational databases, data files containing packet traffic or network flow information, and other report files - usually in extensible markup language (XML) format. In a network infrastructure of this size, it becomes very difficult to keep abreast of the complex relationships that exist within. Additionally, due to the sheer volume of data produced in the previously mentioned formats, a method to aid in extracting the security relevant content from the data becomes highly essential. We propose the use of network graphs to address these limitations in the current Interrogator architecture. Generation of the graphs required the development of methods to extract - from the data sources available - the needed connectivity and data transfer information. This information was then passed to a graphing utility, Graphviz, which was used to generate the network graphs. Using the capabilities provided in Graphviz, we were able to quickly obtain information about any node in the network including: the connectivity of the node, the data transferred, and any alerts generated that included these nodes. These graphs are used as another analysis source for an analyst to aid in the identification of suspicious network behavior","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652126","","Data mining;Data security;Data visualization;Face detection;Information analysis;Intelligent networks;Military standards;Relational databases;Telecommunication traffic;XML","data flow analysis;data visualisation;electronic data interchange;relational databases;security of data;software architecture","Graphviz;Interrogator infrastructure;data transfer information;network flow information;network graphs;packet traffic;relational databases","","1","","12","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is based on the idea that human beings tend to exhibit random motion patterns during abnormal situations.

By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers.","1063-6927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2015.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164948","","Ash;Communities;IP networks;Malware;Robustness;Servers;Silicon","data mining;hypermedia;invasive software;network servers","HTTP requests;HTTP traffic;ISP;SMASH;cyber criminals;dynamic malicious infrastructures;malicious HTTP activities;malware campaign discovery;malware distribution;systematic mining of associated server herds;undetected malicious servers;zero-day attacks","","0","","31","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use an association rule to track all relevant data dependency rule sets for different access roles using a hierarchical structure. We identify malicious transactions from the transaction logs in the database using the data dependency rule sets. These rule sets are continuously updated and stored in a repository.

Driven by the miniaturization and integration of sensing, communication, and computation in cost-efficient devices, CPSs are bound to transform industries such as aerospace, transportation, built environments, energy, health care, and manufacturing, to name a few. This great opportunity, unfortunately, is matched by even greater challenges. Taming the complexity of design and analysis of these systems poses a fundamental problem as a new paradigm is needed to bridge various scientific domains, which, through the years, have developed significantly different formalisms and methodologies. In addition, while the use of dedicated communication networks has so far sheltered systems from the outside world, use of off-the-shelf networking and computing, combined with the unattended operation of a plethora of devices, provides several opportunities for malicious entities to inject attacks on CPSs. A wide variety of motivations exists for launching an attack on CPSs, ranging from economic reasons, such as obtaining a financial gain, all the way to terrorism, for instance, threatening an entire population by manipulating life-critical resources. Any attack on safety-critical CPSs may significantly hamper the economy and lead to the loss of human lives. While the threat of attacks on CPSs tends to be underplayed at times, the Stuxnet worm provided a clear example of the possible future to come. This malware, targeting a uranium enriching facility in Iran, managed to reach the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system controlling the centrifuges used in the enrichment process. Stuxnet modified the control system, increasing pressure in the centrifuges in a first version of the worm and spinning centrifuges in an erratic fashion in a second version.

In this article we describe a CRN based on IEEE wireless regional area network (WRAN) and describe some of the security threats against it. For the secondary users in the CRN to quickly detect whether they are being attacked, a simple yet effective IDS is then presented. Our proposal uses non-parametric cumulative sum (cusum) as the change point detection algorithm to discover the abnormal behavior due to attacks. Our proposed IDS adopts an anomaly detection approach and it profiles the CRN system parameters through a learning phase. So, our proposal is also able to detect new types of attacks. As an example, we present the case of detection of a jamming attack, which was not known to the IDS beforehand.

A node's misbehavior can have severe impact in overall network performance. One of the different kinds of misbehavior a node may exhibit is malicious packet dropping. In this paper, we focus on detecting and excluding nodes that misbehave by dropping some or all packets forwarded through them. We propose a reputation-based scheme for efficiently solving the problem. The proposed scheme use both self-observation and second-hand information to establish comprehensive reputation of a node. Nodes with bad comprehensive reputation will be excluded from the network. History reputation is also taken into account to providing indeliberate faults tolerance. Furthermore, we use fuzzy analysis to deal with the imprecision based on the fact that the cause of packet dropping can be heterogeneous and therefore improve the performance without imposing a high computational burden.","","978-1-4244-4754-1","978-1-4244-4738-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358211","ad hoc networks;packet dropping;reputations","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Fault tolerance;High performance computing;History;Mathematics;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Routing","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;fuzzy set theory;mobile radio","fault tolerance;fuzzy analysis;history reputation;malicious packet dropping;mobile ad hoc network;network performance;node misbehavior;reputation-based scheme","","1","","18","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 2003 Symposium on","20030709","2003","","","363","367","Many corporations and government organizations spend millions of dollars in the protection of their company or organizational data. These protection mechanisms often follow a secured layered approach, called defense in depth (DiD), which allow these organizations to have a more secured network based on security mechanisms at different areas of their network design. Defense in depth is the concept of protecting a computer network with a series of defensive mechanisms such that if one mechanism fails, another will already be in place to thwart an attack. Because there are so many potential attackers with such a wide variety of attack methods available, there is no single method for successfully protecting a computer network. Utilizing the strategy of defense in depth will reduce the risk of having a successful-and likely very costly-attack on a network. In today's environment there is more of a need than ever for increased security in enterprise level networks. Companies are finding themselves with offices around the world and needing a way to provide an affordable high speed secure communications between them as well as provide ways to implement wireless technologies in a secured environment. This paper describes an example of how this can be done and the special issues and challenges associated with securing these types of networks.","","0-7695-1873-7","","10.1109/SAINTW.2003.1210187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210187","","Communication system security;Companies;Computer networks;Costs;Data security;Government;Information security;Intellectual property;Protection;Wireless application protocol","Internet;business communication;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Internet;computer network security;corporations;defense-in-depth security architected network;enterprise level networks;government organizations;high speed secure communications;organizational data;wireless access points","","0","","15","","","27-31 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It consists of four components, namely, rule-based component, belief combination component, security sensitive history database component and Bayesian learning component. The rule-based component consists of a set of well-defined rules which give independent evidences about a transaction's behavior. An extension of Dempster-Shafer's theory is used to combine multiple such evidences and an initial belief is computed. First level inferences are made about the transaction depending on this initial belief. Once the transaction is found to be suspicious, belief is updated according to its similarity with malicious or genuine transaction history using Bayesian learning. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed intrusion detection system can effectively detect intrusive attacks in databases without raising too many false alarms.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925094","Bayesian learning;Database security;Dempster-Shafer theory;Intrusion detection;Suspicion score","Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Computer security;Data security;Database systems;History;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Transaction databases","belief networks;database management systems;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;security of data","Bayesian learning component;Dempster-Shafer theory;belief combination component;database intrusion detection;first level inference;rule-based component;security sensitive history database component","","2","","4","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these shortcomings, in this paper, a new packet filter schema based on multilevel signature and DFA grouping is proposed. In particular, an algorithm called ""DFA pseudo-split"" is presented in our proposal to overcome the shortage of signatures.
