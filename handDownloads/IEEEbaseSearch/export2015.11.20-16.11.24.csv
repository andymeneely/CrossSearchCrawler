In this work we propose a novel distributed node self-monitoring mechanism for wireless sensor networks. Assuming a sensor node can detect the communications (sending message) of its neighboring nodes, we design a one-to-many self-monitoring mechanism, in which the selected nodes, named Monitor Nodes (MNs), can monitor their neighboring nodes. A distributed dominating set approximation algorithm is design to obtain the MN set. The cooperation among MNs guarantees all regular nodes (RNs) are monitored. However, the MNs may be compromised by external attackers and produces false alarms. To improve the one-to-many self-monitoring mechanism, we design a many-to-one dynamical monitoring approach to take the MNs under surveillance. The neighboring nodes of a MN are dynamically selected to monitor their MN. In the proposed mechanism, a node produces an alert when it detects abnormal behaviors of the node under surveillance. The sink node collects the alert messages to make judgment to the potential abnormal nodes. The proposed self-monitoring mechanism can be used to detect and position multiple inter-network attacks, including selective forwarding, black-hole and DoS. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed node self-monitoring mechanism.","","978-1-4244-7616-9","","10.1109/ICISE.2010.5691634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5691634","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Manganese;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","24","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MobiQuitous 2007. Fourth Annual International Conference on","20080212","2007","","","1","8","Several intrusion detection approaches have been proposed for mobile ad hoc networks. Many of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected adhoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. In addition, new history based routing schemes e.g. Prophet have been proposed because traditional adhoc routing schemes do not work well in sparse ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks that use Prophet as their routing scheme. Via simulations, we study the effectiveness of the FBIDM scheme when malicious nodes launch selective data dropping attacks. Our results with different mobility models, ferry speed, traffic load scenarios indicate that the FBIDM scheme is promising in reducing the impact of such malicious attacks.","","978-1-4244-1024-8","978-1-4244-1025-5","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451068","DoS resilience;disruption tolerant networks;intrusion detection;prophet;routing;sparsely connected adhoc networks","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;History;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Resilience;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","data dropping attacks;ferry-based intrusion detection;history based routing schemes;mobile ad hoc networks;sparsely connected ad hoc networks","","8","","20","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed procedure a 2D mesh topology is selected first while PCA algorithm is represented in form of a task graph, which can be divided into 2 levels. In the higher level, tasks are matrix-based algorithms, such as mean computation, which in turn will be mapped onto the NoC topology. Since the NoC is scalable, an appropriate size of 2D mesh will be selected so that the timing of each task in the task chain is matched resulting in an effective pipeline in the higher level. The simulation using SystemC with NoC modeled as Cycle-Accurate showed that an average throughput of 2.20 Gbps and latency of 0.025 cycle/flit were achieved while computing the matrix multiplication of size 112×92 with 81 Processing Element (PE) organize as 9×9 while running with clock speed of 100 MHz.","","978-1-4673-1156-4","978-1-4673-1155-7","10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6381018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381018","2D Principal Component Analysis (2D-PCA);Homogeneous Processor;Networks-on-Chip (NoC);Parallel Matrix Multiplication;System-on-Chip (SoC);SystemC","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Hardware;Principal component analysis;Signal processing algorithms","matrix multiplication;network-on-chip;principal component analysis;topology","2D mesh topology;NoC topology;PCA algorithm;SystemC;hardware implementation;matrix based algorithm;matrix manipulation;matrix multiplication;mean computation;networks on chip paradigm;principal component analysis;processing element;task chain;task graph","","0","","9","","","2-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM. Our experiments show that it successfully defeats synthesized dynamic data kernel rootkits in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066457","Virtual machine monitor;dynamic data kernel rootkits;intrusion prevention system","Availability;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Kernel;Manipulator dynamics;Monitoring;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;operating system kernels;virtual machines","QEMU VMM;VMM-based guest-transparent monitoring;dynamic data kernel rootkit attack;operating system kernel;virtual machine monitor","","8","4","27","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis.

While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231","Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks","Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks","","35","","52","","2010-06-10","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Together with the rise of Cyber Warfare and the resulting impact on the environment means that we have to bring intelligence back to the network. Consequently, effective Cyber Defence will be more and more important. In this paper we will show that the proposed requirements for an Early Warning System are a main part of future Cyber Defence. Special attention is given on the challenges associated to the generation of early warning systems for future attacks on the Internet of the Future. The term Cyber War is used frequently but unfortunately with different intends. Therefore, we start with a definition of the term Cyber War focusing on security aspects related to the Internet of the Future, followed by an exemplification of a Cyber War, of its implications and the challenges associated to it. Then we proceed with an analysis of state of the art recent work that has been proposed on the topic. Additionally the weaknesses of these analyzed systems and approaches are presented. Finally we propose guidelines and requirements for future work which will be needed to implement a next generation early warning system for securing the Internet of the Future.","","978-1-61284-245-5","978-9949-9040-3-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954706","Cyber Defence;Cyber Warfare;Early Warning System;Internet of the Future","Alarm systems;Computers;Government;Internet;Weapons;Web sites","Internet;alarm systems;security of data","EWS;cyber defence;cyber warfare;early warning system;internet","","3","","39","","","7-10 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades.

Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a ""neighborhood watch"" concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X","0-7803-7952-7","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","3","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At present, however, because of the characteristics of Internet - diversity, anonymity - the real-time traceback is very difficult. To over-come this problem the Network-based Real-Time Connection Traceback System (NRCTS) was proposed. But the NRCTS has a problem that it should construct an extra network path to external network to adopt the system. So, in this paper, we propose a modified NRCTS that could be applied without the extra network path.","","89-5519-119-7","","10.1109/ICACT.2004.1292989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292989","NRCTS;Network Security;Traceback;hacking","Authorization;Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer science;IP networks;Internet;Protection;Real time systems;Security;Statistics","","","","0","","14","","","9-11 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to statistical studies, people spend 80% of their lives in buildings. Hence it is not surprising that they constantly seek to improve comfort in their living spaces. This paper presents an intelligent control system based on artificial immune system architecture to maintain the thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption. Specifically, a residential building is regarded as a human body and a comfortable thermal environment means the healthy state of body. Whenever outside factors disturb this state, which is analogous to the intrusion of pathogens, the immune system will work automatically to eliminate them and therefore to keep the proper state of the body. The experimental results show the advantages of our system comparing with two widely used baseline approaches: two-position control and PI control.","","978-1-4799-2481-3","","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2013.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726209","","Buildings;Computer architecture;Equations;Immune system;Mathematical model;Solar heating","PI control;artificial immune systems;building management systems;energy consumption;energy management systems;home automation;intelligent control;position control;space heating","PI control;artificial immune system architecture;building comfort;energy consumption reduction;energy management;environmental problem;information technology;intelligent control system;intelligent residential building system;living spaces;thermal comfort;thermal environment;two-position control","","0","","31","","","18-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For success application of ubiquitous WSN it is important to maintain the basic security. However, there is not an effective intrusion detection and self-recovery system to eliminate the harm of DoS attacks. To solve the problem, an agent-based intrusion detection and self-recovery system for WSNs is proposed, which adopts the distributed architecture to monitor intrusion activities and realize abnormal events processing in local nodes.

However, modern DoS attacks that blend normal and malicious network traffic, significantly increase the rate of false alarms, hence challenge the effectiveness of IDS. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy IDS to address the uncertainty problem in distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic. The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. Comparing to other related works, our system exhibited a detection rate of 99.91%,while only produced around 1600 false alarms in more than 5 million test sessions, against DoS flooding attacks, where just a reduced number of features employed.","","978-1-4799-5658-6","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030332","Classification;Denial of Service;Fuzzy Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Taxonomy","Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network security;decision trees;fuzzy set theory;telecommunication traffic","DoS flooding attacks;KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;attacks categorization;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision-tree structure;expert knowledge;fuzzy IDS;fuzzy detection engine;fuzzy intrusion detection system;machine intelligence;malicious network traffic;misuse patterns;modern DoS attacks;network environments;normal network traffic;uncertainty problem","","0","","18","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the facts that security was not part of the goals for designing the DNP3 and the incompetent of current protection systems, adversary can easily succeed in attacking DNP3 devices and network. In this paper, we present an Autonomic Network Protection Framework for DNP3 over TCP/IP that detects old attacks that cannot be prevented by the legacy DNP3 security devices as well as new attacks. The system's detection module is based on rule-based anomaly intrusion detection. We evaluated the effectiveness of the generated rules in detecting anomalies through both offline and online testing.

With the expansion of LLNs applications, security of RPL becomes one of the major concerns. This paper mainly addresses the security aspect of RPL. We first analyze the vulnerability of RPL self-organising properties, and identify a new RPL internal intrusion, named routing choice (RC) intrusion. We specially analyze the harm of a type RC intrusion in RPL using ETX metric, which further validates the effectiveness of our work. Second, we design IDSs for RPL to defense intrusions. Our design discusses detection methodologies, system architectures, detection data and intrusion respose with some promotions. To satisfy the energy efficiency requirements, we propose three type Monitor Nodes (MNs) devices for different RPL applications. To explicitly show the design of IDSs, we apply our IDS to defense the type of RC intrusion in RPL using ETX metric on Contiki OS, and the results verify the effectiveness of our IDSs. Finally, we theoretically analyzed the applicability of IDSs for RPL.","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247579","Contiki OS;IDSs;LLNs;RPL;Routing Choice (RC) intrusion","Delays;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Manganese;Monitoring;Routing","computer network security;energy conservation;routing protocols","Contiki OS;ETX metric;IDS;LLN;MN;RC intrusion;RPL security;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;low power and lossy network;monitor node;routing choice intrusion;routing protocol","","","","12","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, major detection and tolerance capabilities are protected against intruders attempts since they are performed by compromise independent components. The GIDTA components implement different functions based on global and hierarchical models allowing flee grained distributed analysis, and including intelligent capabilities that are able to impose a dynamic behavior taking into consideration the security state of the cooperating entities. A protocol called a neighbor identification protocol is designed to enhance detection and tolerance capabilities.

The focus of our research is on techniques for automatically constructing anomaly detection models that are capable of detecting new or unseen attacks. We propose a new anomaly detection method for MANET. The proposed method performs cross-feature analysis on the basis of rough sets to capture the inter-feature correlation patterns in normal traffic.

FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as ""flow key"". FSAS configures flow flexibly to provide security from network level to application level (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP...), and different aggregation schemes, such as server-based, client-based flow.

Despite numerous technological innovations for information assurance, it is still very difficult to protect computer systems. Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks. Experimental results show the achievement of acceptable detection rates based on benchmark DARPA data sets on intrusions, while no other complementary techniques or relevant heuristics are applied.","","0-7695-2294-7","","10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434896","Information assurance;genetic algorithms;misuse intrusion detection;software development;support-confidence","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;genetic algorithms;security of data;software engineering","Internet;genetic algorithms;information assurance;misuse intrusion detection;network audit data;network intrusion detection;security threat;software development;support-confidence framework","","14","","17","","","23-25 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a context of high traffic with heavy tailed characteristics, static rules for dispatching traffic slices among distributed sensors cause severe imbalance. Hence, the distributed NIDS architecture must be combined with adequate mechanisms for dynamic load redistribution. In this paper, we propose and compare different policies for the activation/deactivation of the dynamic load balancer. In particular, we consider and compare single vs. double threshold schemes, and load representations based on resource measures vs. load aggregation models. Our experimental results show that the best combination of a double threshold scheme with a linear aggregation of resource measures is able to achieve a really satisfactory balance of the sensor loads together with a sensible reduction of the number of load balancer activations.","","0-7695-2922-4","","10.1109/NCA.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276617","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Dispatching;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Load management;Load modeling;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dispatching traffic slices;distributed architectures;dynamic load balancing;dynamic load redistribution;multiple sensors;network intrusion detection systems","","4","","23","","","12-14 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results on the benchmark KDD '99 intrusion data set show that our proposed system based on Layered Conditional Random Fields outperforms other well-known methods such as the decision trees and the naive Bayes. The improvement in attack detection accuracy is very high, particularly, for the U2R attacks (34.8 percent improvement) and the R2L attacks (34.5 percent improvement).

ID always generates huge data sets; such raw data sets are incapable of being training due to its large scale and high dimension and redundancy. Intrusion detection system always has the disadvantages such as over-loaded, occupying too much resource, an extension of training and forecasting time... therefore, the simplification of practical information becomes such a necessity. Recursive support vector machine (R-SVM) and Rough set were used for exacting main features of raw data, and many kinds of classification algorithms were used here and it has been tested by KDDCUP1999 date set.

In our approach we consider that a nervous system design and organization is a constructive process carried out by genetic information encoded in DNA. Our NEA evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a Lindenmayer System with memory that implements the principles of organization, modularity, repetition (multiple use of the same sub-structure), hierarchy (recursive composition of sub-structures), as a metaphor for development of neurons and its connections. In our method, this basic neural codification is integrated to a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that implements the constructive approach found in the evolutionary process, making it closest to the biological ones. Our method was initially tested on a simple, but non-trivial, XOR problem. We also submit our method to two other problems of increasing complexity: Prediction of the effect of a new drug on Breast Cancer and KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Some advantages of the proposed methodology are that it increases the level of implicit parallelism of the GA and seems to be capable of generating minimal satisfactory neural architectures, resulting in a reduction of project costs and increasing the performance of the evolved ANN, suggesting a promising potential for future applications.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280535","","Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;Genomics;Legged locomotion;RNA","DNA;genetic algorithms;neural net architecture;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","ANN;DNA;KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset;L-system;Lindenmayer System;NEA;artificial neural networks;biologically inspired neuroevolutive algorithm;breast cancer drug;constructive process;evolutionary computation;evolutionary process;genetic algorithm;genetic information encoding;hierarchical neural structures;minimal satisfactory neural architectures;modular neural structures;nervous system design;neural codification;nontrivial XOR problem;project cost reduction;recurrent neural structures;recursive substructure composition","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The consistency and sufficiency of both factors X Y, demonstrated using the Information Theory, can explain the risk of a dynamic system. However, going deep into their meaning, the Theory of Calculability should ensure its validity in the design of self-protected networks and dynamic systems.

Existing blacklisting techniques have focused on the most prolific attack sources and, more recently, on collaborative blacklisting. In this paper, we formulate the problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as ""predictive blacklisting"") based on shared attack logs, as an implicit recommendation system. We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for prediction and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement. Inspired by the recent NetFlix competition, we propose a multi-level collaborative filtering model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting problem. Our model captures and combines various factors namely: attacker-victim history (using time-series) and attackers and/or victims interactions (using neighborhood models).

The detection engine of the system is based on the incremental mining of fuzzy association rules from network packets, in which membership functions of fuzzy variables are optimized by a genetic algorithm. The incremental mining approach makes the system suitable for detecting, and thus, responding to an attack in real-time. This system is evaluated by 47 flooding attacks, only one of which is missed, with no false positives occurring. The proposed online system belongs to anomaly detection, not misuse detection.

The purpose of this work is to contribute ideas of finding a solution to detect attacks (intrusion) through building artificial detection system using feedforward neural networks to detect attacks with low false negative rate (which is the most important point), and low false positive rate. To do so, two feedforward neural networks architectures (one for non fuzzified data, the other for fuzzified data) are suggested, and their behaviors in detecting the attacks are studied.

Most results to date, however, suggest ways to architect new software constructed from the ground up as autonomic systems, whereas in the real world organizations continue to use stovepipe legacy systems and/or build ''systems of systems'' that draw from a gamut of new and legacy components involving disparate technologies from numerous vendors. Our goal is to retrofit autonomic computing onto such systems, externally, without any need to understand or modify the code, and in many cases even when it is impossible to recompile. We present a meta-architecture implemented as active middleware infrastructure to explicitly add autonomic services via an attached feedback loop that provides continual monitoring and, as needed, reconfiguration and/or repair. Our lightweight design and separation of concerns enables easy adoption of individual components, as well as the full infrastructure, for use with a large variety of legacy, new systems, and systems of systems.

However, DTNs are vulnerable to insider attacks, in which the legitimate nodes are compromised and the adversary nodes launch blackhole attacks by dropping packets in the networks. The traditional approaches of securing routing protocols can not address such insider attacks in DTNs. In this paper, we propose a method to secure the history records of packet delivery information at each contact so that other nodes can detect insider attacks by analyzing these packet delivery records. We evaluated our approach through extensive simulations using both Random Way Point and Zebranet mobility models. Our results show that our method can detect insider attacks efficiently with high detection rate and low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-7264-2","978-1-4244-7263-5","10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5534944","","Equations;History;Mathematical model;Measurement;Routing;Routing protocols;Simulation","","","","2","","11","","","14-17 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the signatures are expressed in a well-defined language, it is possible to analyze the attack signatures and automatically generate events or series of events that conform to the attack descriptions. This approach has been used in tools whose goal is to force intrusion detection systems to generate a large number of detection alerts. The resulting ""alert storm"" is used to desensitize intrusion detection system administrators and hide attacks in the event stream. We apply a similar technique to perform testing of intrusion detection systems. Signatures from one intrusion detection system are used as input to an event stream generator that produces randomized synthetic events that match the input signatures. The resulting event stream is then fed to a number of different intrusion detection systems and the results are analyzed. This paper presents the general testing approach and describes the first prototype of a tool, called Mucus, that automatically generates network traffic using the signatures of the Snort network-based intrusion detection system. The paper describes preliminary cross-testing experiments with both an open-source and a commercial tool and reports the results.

In addition, security threats and vulnerabilities include lack of proper authentication, insecure routing and complex mobility and identity management needs. If nodes do not have any prior knowledge of each other, trust establishment becomes complicated. For this kind of scenarios, we propose a mechanism that the nodes themselves should be responsible of their own security - or they could trust certain known nodes, ldquomicro-operators.rdquo In addition, we compare trust establishment in both operator-controlled and self-organized mobile ad hoc networks using example scenarios. In operator-controlled case, a trusted third partner provides central administration for the network via a decoupling point. In the self-organized case, networks are formed without central administration.","","978-1-4244-4153-2","978-0-7695-3650-7","10.1109/MDM.2009.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088986","authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;security assurance","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer networks;Conference management;Data security;Identity management systems;Middleware;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;node level security management;self-organization;trust management","","2","","38","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181","","Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","SRAM chips;security of data","SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint","","0","","12","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the fusion problems of the multifocus images with the same scence, this paper proposed a new fusion method based on nonsampled contourlet transform(NSCT). Firstly, source images are decomposed in different scales and directions by NSCT, thus the low frequency subband coefficients and the high frequency subband coefficients are obtained. Secondly, for the low frequency subband coefficients, we present a fusion rule based on the local entropy; while for the high frequency subband coefficients, a fusion rule based on the directional contrast combined with the local area energy is applied. Finally, the fused image is obtained through the inverse NSCT. Compared with the fusion method based wavelet and other fusion methods, the experiments show that this approach can achieve better results than them.","","978-1-4673-1772-6","","10.1109/IFOST.2012.6357605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6357605","directional contrast;image fusion;local area energy;local entropy;nonsubsampled contourlet transform","Entropy;Image fusion;Laser beams;Laser sintering;Laser theory;Standards;Transforms","entropy;image fusion;wavelet transforms","NSCT;directional contrast;fusion method based wavelet method;fusion rule;high frequency subband coefficients;image processing;local area energy;local entropy;low frequency subband coefficients;multifocus image fusion method;nonsubsampled contourlet transform;source image decomposition","","0","","11","","","18-21 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Third IEEE International Conference on","20071204","2007","","","78","78","In this paper, we consider the problem of increasing the effectiveness of an intrusion detection system (IDS) for a cluster of nodes in ad hoc networks. To solve such a problem, a head cluster is elected by the nodes to handle the detection service. Current solution elects a leader randomly without considering the energy level of nodes. Such solution is vulnerable to selfish nodes that do not provide IDS service to others while at the same time benefiting from others' services. From our experiments, selfish nodes reduce the effectiveness of an IDS since less packets are inspected over time. Here, we are modeling a distributed, truthful, and efficient mechanism for electing a leader IDS that handles the detection process in a cluster. Our solution is able to balance the energy among all the nodes and increase the overall lifetime of an IDS in a cluster. In our model, incentives are given in the form of reputation to encourage the nodes to cooperate in the leader election process. The reputation is used to track the cooperative behavior of nodes where miss-behaving nodes are punished by withholding the cluster's services. Reputations are calculated based on the truth-telling mechanism design known as Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG). Our analysis prove that truth-telling is the dominant strategy for all the nodes and therefore efficiency is guaranteed. Finally, simulation results show that our mechanism improves the performance of an IDS in analyzing packets and punishes misbehaving nodes.","","978-0-7695-2889-2","","10.1109/WIMOB.2007.4390872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4390872","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Game theory;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Microeconomics;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile communication;telecommunication security","IDS election mechanism;MANET;intrusion detection system;leader election process;miss-behaving nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;reputations;selfish nodes;truth-telling mechanism design","","3","","15","","","8-10 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To protect information systems, system administrators must be able to represent vulnerabilities in a way that lends itself to correlation, analysis, and prediction. State of the art intrusion detection and attack analysis systems struggle to effectively represent sophisticated attacks. Strategic models express exploits as goal-oriented attack trees. Attack trees represent adversarial behavior by connecting events in 'AND'-'OR' tree structures. However these structures need to be enhanced and expressed in a formal manner in order to adequately represent the complexity of recent cyber attacks. This paper provides a methodology for capturing the structure of various network vulnerabilities and multi-stage attacks. By extending the attack tree paradigm, we provide a context sensitive attack modeling framework that, through abstraction, supports incident correlation, analysis, and prediction.","1530-2016","0-7695-1680-7","","10.1109/ICPPW.2002.1039705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039705","","Context modeling;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Joining processes;Network topology;Predictive models;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Tree data structures","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security;tree data structures","Nimda;Solar Sunrise;attack analysis systems;complex network attacks;cyber attacks;goal-oriented attack trees;incident correlation;information systems;intrusion detection;multi-stage network attack modeling;structural framework;tree data structures","","10","2","16","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
