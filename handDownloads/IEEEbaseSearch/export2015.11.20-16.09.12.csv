Its high computational demands have been pushing networking researchers to study how to improve DPI technologies. However, in this quest for better performance, little effort has been devoted to making fair performance comparisons among DPIs. Even worse, most studies show performance gains by applying DPI techniques using specific, and sometimes small, signature sets. Consequently, one DPI engine may report a certain maximum throughput while another one may report a similar performance but may have used a significantly smaller signature set. This fact makes it clear that the research community needs a well-defined framework for testing new DPI systems. This paper proposes a new framework for characterizing signature sets for evaluating DPI systems and provides an in-depth analysis of signature sets from application, protocol, and intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4673-0039-1","978-1-4673-0038-4","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2011.6162539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6162539","Characterization of Signature Sets;Computer Networks;Deep Packet Inspection;Performance Evaluation","Complexity theory;Distance measurement;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Spyware;Testing","computer network management;computer network security;digital signatures;inspection;protocols;telecommunication traffic","DPI system testing;deep packet inspection;intrusion detection systems;network management;protocol;signature sets;traffic profiling","","5","","18","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reach these objectives, mechanisms of classical networks that provide established functionalities have to be revalued and either transformed or redesigned from scratch to take advantage from SDNs. In this paper we describe our vision on flow sampling suitable for traffic monitoring in those networks. Without the loss of generality our approach was specifically created to monitor the quality of service for flows.

The performance of multiuser selection scheme is evaluated in two cases: in the absence of interference and in the presence of multiuser interference (MUI). In the former case, the closed-form capacity outage probability as well as the numerical values of the bit error rate (BER) are obtained via the probability density function (PDF) of signal to noise ratio (SNR) that is derived from the amplitude distribution property of the classic indoor Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) channel. In the latter case, the multiuser interference cancellation coefficient as a random variable is added for the calculation of signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). In addition, due to free space path loss and log-normal shadowing, the sum of MUI is treated as another log-normal-distributed random variable by exploiting central limit theorem. Numerical results show that the performance of multiuser selection scheme in HANs of smart grid is due to several factors, i.e., total number of devices in HANs, traffic intensity, modulation scheme, and multiuser interference cancellation coefficient, etc.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457436","Bit error rate (BER);home area networks (HANs);multiuser interference (MUI);multiuser selection;outage probability;smart grid","Bit error rate;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Interference;Modulation;Random variables;Signal to noise ratio;Smart grids","error statistics;home networks;interference suppression;log normal distribution;multiuser channels;probability;radio receivers;radiofrequency interference;radiotelemetry;smart meters;smart power grids","BER;HAN;MUI;PDF;S-V model;SINR;SNR;amplitude distribution property;bit error rate;classic indoor Saleh-Valen- zuela channel;closed-form capacity outage probability;dynamic home area networks;fading effects;free space path loss;log-normal shadowing;modulation scheme;multiuser interference cancellation coefficient;multiuser selection scheme;probability density func- tion;signal to noise ratio;smart grid communications;smart meter;traffic intensity","","1","","23","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signatures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do not pass the verification. Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets. Analytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained for players in the proposed game, and significant benefits can be provided to forwarders such that many of the bad packets will be eliminated by verification.","","978-1-4244-0974-7","978-1-4244-0975-4","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550349","","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Computer crime;Filtering;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","21","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The novel idea pursued in this study is to exploit the real time properties of data in intrusion detection. Data objects will be tagged with “time semantics” that capture expectations about update rates that are unknown to the intruders. This is not simply timestamping data. Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as “normal” transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system. The experimental results show that this technique could be a powerful discriminating measure to identify intruders with a low false alarm rate.

To provide situational awareness, detection systems usually employ (alert, priority) mappings that are either built in the IDS without consideration of the high-level mission objectives of the infrastructure, or manually defined by administrators through a time-consuming task that requires deep system-level expertise. In this paper, we present Seclius, an online security evaluation framework that translates low-level IDS alerts into a high-level system security measure and provides a ranking of past malicious events and affected system assets based on how crucial they are for the organization. Seclius significantly reduces human involvement by automatically learning system characteristics, providing a simple formalism that administrators can use to define security requirements. Experiments on a process control network with real vulnerabilities and a multistep attack show that Seclius can accurately report system security with low performance overhead and support the time-constrained security decision-making process that is necessary for critical infrastructure.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547151","Intrusion detection systems;information flow-based analysis;system security metric","Databases;Measurement;Organizations;Probabilistic logic;Security;Web servers","security of data","IDS;IT systems;Seclius framework;critical infrastructure;high-level system security measure;information flow-based consequence-centric security metric;information systems;intrusion detection system;online security evaluation framework;time-constrained security decision-making process","","1","","","","2013-06-25","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Low processing power and wireless connectivity make such networks vulnerable to various types of attacks. The dense deployment of sensors along with the protocol deficiencies, make broadcast attacks feasible. The current solutions for these types of attacks are mainly cryptographic and suffer from either heavy computational complexity or lack of mobility support. In this paper we propose an energy efficient method to fortify sensor networks against broadcast attacks using some key features of such networks like small transmission range and low reception-sensitivity. The main idea relies on modifying the reply timings of current MAC sub-layer protocols and embedding a two or three-way handshake protocol in broadcast scenarios so that the adversary receives a negative feedback from the network in response to his greediness in infecting nodes. The simulations confirm the efficiency of this countermeasure applied to the IEEE 802.15.4.","","978-1-4244-2750-5","978-1-4244-2751-2","10.1109/ISTEL.2008.4651270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4651270","Broadcast Attacks;Medium Access Control Protocols;Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Communication system security;Computational complexity;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy efficiency;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;computational complexity;cryptography;personal area networks;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4;MAC sublayer protocols;ad hoc networks paradigm;broadcast attacks;computational complexity;cryptography;mobility support;physical environment monitoring;protocol deficiencies;reception-sensitivity;wireless connectivity;wireless sensor network security","","2","","15","","","27-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Hidden Markov Model is proposed for sensing intrusions in a distributed environment and to make a one step ahead prediction against possible serious intrusions. DIPS is activated based on the predicted threat level and risk assessment of the protected assets. Intrusions attempts are blocked based on (1) a serious attack that has already occurred (2) rate of packet flow (3) prediction of possible serious intrusions and (4) online risk assessment of the assets possibly available to the intruder. The focus of this paper is on the distributed monitoring of intrusion attempts, the one step ahead prediction of such attempts and online risk assessment using fuzzy inference systems.

In the early stages of deployment, the intrusion and security problems have not been seriously considered, although they could have a negative impact on VoIP deployment. In the paper, SIP intrusion detection and prevention requirements are analyzed and an IDS/IPS architecture is proposed. A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service. Hence, the performance of the proposed architecture has been evaluated in terms of impact that its operation has on the QoS experienced by the VoIP users.","","1-4244-0144-5","","10.1109/VOIPMS.2006.1638122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1638122","","Communication system security;Computer architecture;Data security;Delay;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Quality of service;Switches","Internet telephony;public domain software;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","IDS-IPS architecture;QoS;SIP intrusion detection;TCP;UDP;VoIP deployment;data network;network-based intrusion detection;open-source software Snort;prevention technique;protocol analysis;quality of service;session initiation protocol;transmission control protocol;user datagram protocol","","17","3","13","","","3 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.","","978-1-4244-2201-2","978-1-4244-2202-9","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004","","Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy","","1","","18","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

However, it is time and memory consuming for large datasets. This study proposed a parameter-free method to accelerate NNR. This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed parameter-free classification algorithm is very easy to operate and gives consideration to speed and accuracy.","","978-1-4244-0973-0","978-1-4244-0973-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370457","Accelerating;Classification;Clustering;Nearest neighbor;Parameter-Free","Acceleration;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data mining;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Training data","pattern classification;pattern clustering","class-based clustering;cluster representations;fast nearest neighbor classification;nearest neighbor rule;parameter-free classifier","","1","","18","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the pattern dividing, the variety of target pattern lengths can be mitigated, so that memory usage in homogeneous string matchers can be efficient. In order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns.

As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.","","","","10.1109/SPW.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302","","Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;finite state machines;protocols","FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications","","0","","9","","","17-18 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, with the surge of complex offered services from one side and the proliferation of hackers' refined, advanced, and sophisticated techniques from the other side, the task of containing cyber scanning poses serious issues and challenges. Furthermore recently, there has been a flourishing of a cyber phenomenon dubbed as cyber scanning campaigns - scanning techniques that are highly distributed, possess composite stealth capabilities and high coordination - rendering almost all current detection techniques unfeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire cyber scanning topic. It categorizes cyber scanning by elaborating on its nature, strategies and approaches. It also provides the reader with a classification and an exhaustive review of its techniques. Moreover, it offers a taxonomy of the current literature by focusing on distributed cyber scanning detection methods.

In response to this, a number of countermeasures have been developed, including intrusion detection systems that aim to detect anomalous behaviour caused by attacks. We present a set of socio-technical challenges associated with developing an intrusion detection system for a community wireless mesh network.

Therefore, the software remains vulnerable to attacks which are handled by issuing patches or service packs by the software vendors. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed to take security into consideration right from the very beginning of the software development process. However, most specification languages were not designed with an intention for specifying security requirements, and therefore, they lack some features to serve this purpose. As a result, we need suitable specification languages that can be used both for functional specification and security specification. We propose a formal extension of a popular specification language called AsmL (Abstract State Machine Language) for attack descriptions with a view to building secure software. We name the extended language AsmLSec. We present the details of AsmLSec syntax and semantics, describe how to model attacks using its constructs, and present the design and implementation of a compiler that generates attack signatures from the AsmLSec attack specifications.

Depending on the complexity of the firewall ruleset, filtering performance of the IDS can decrease considerably during high-load flooding situations. In this paper we propose a scheme to increase IDS firewall performance by merging several similar rules into more general ones and ignoring lesser relevant rules to limit the number of firewall rules. We formalise a mathematical model to compute new firewall rules and show exemplary with traffic from SIP VoIP communication networks how the calculation can be performed.

In MANET, routing attacks try to disrupt the routing protocol functions by intentionally or unintentionally dropping packets or by propagating faked routing messages. However, due to their computation requirements and inefficiency against internal attacks, the prevention only mechanisms are not powerful enough to secure MANET routing protocols. In this paper, we present a distributed and cooperative scheme for MANETs routing attacks detection. The scheme collects and analyzes data that are sensitive to routing attacks so as to detect anomalous events. In this scheme, both direct observations and indirect observations are used so as to characterize the behaviors of both neighboring and remote nodes.

At the same time, it also diminishes the damage and decreases the fixed cost.","","0-7695-1906-7","","10.1109/AINA.2003.1193006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193006","","Computer networks;Computer worms;Delay;Electronic mail;Information analysis;Information management;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Pattern recognition","Internet;invasive software;safety systems","IDS;Internet worm;LAWS;Lambent Anti-Worm System;behavior-based anti-worm system;behavior-based intrusion detection and response system;defense system;intrusion detection system;malicious worms;mobile agents;worm distribution;worm intrusion","","1","2","10","","","27-29 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment. The results showed that ARP hacking tools could not penetrate hosts protected by ASA.","1751-8628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2011.0566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219366","","","IP networks;access protocols;cache storage;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ARP cache management;ARP protocols;UDP packets;Windows XP;address resolution protocol;agent software;antiARP spoofing agent;data link layer address;denial of service attacks;kernel ARP software;network layer address;user datagram protocol packets","","1","","","","","May 1 2012","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

But as the game between attackers and defenders goes further into payload confusion, the approximate string matching technology is needed, especially large-scale approximate multiple string matching technology. In this paper, we propose one practical algorithm, LargePEX, for large scale approximate multiple string matching based on edit distance. The algorithm is basically extended from PEX, an algorithm of approximate single string matching, with the idea of filtering and verification. LargePEX is finely designed to fit for large-scale matching using fine grain steps analyses. Some experiments are presented to verify the efficiency of LargePEX. As the results show, for the set of 10k strings, the average network payload checking speed using this algorithm can achieve 25 MBps-40 MBps, enough for 100 Mbps Ethernet. With hardware upgrading, the algorithm is also practical for Gigabit Ethernet. So LargePEX provides a new way for defenders to develop more effective methods to protect valuable resources and prevent intrusions by payload checking.","","1-4244-0463-0","1-4244-0463-0","10.1109/CHINACOM.2006.344838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4149803","","Computer security;Ethernet networks;Filtering algorithms;Information security;Large-scale systems;National security;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protection;Sequences","local area networks;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","Ethernet;LargePEX;edit distance;filtering;fine grain steps analyses;hardware upgrading;intrusion prevention;large-scale approximate multiple string matching;network security;payload checking;valuable resource protection;verification","","0","","11","","","25-27 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, this paper considers a scenario in which an analyst has to accept or reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> characterized by a probability mass function (pmf) P<sub>X</sub> based on the evidence provided by a test sequence. In turn, the goal of the adversary is to take a sequence generated according to a different pmf and modify it in such a way to induce a decision error. P<sub>X</sub> is known only through one or more training sequences. We derive the asymptotic equilibrium of the game under the assumption that the analyst relies only on first order statistics of the test and training sequences, and compute the asymptotic payoff of the game when the length of the sequences tends to infinity. We introduce the concept of indistinguishability region, defined as the set of pmfs that can not be distinguished reliably from P<sub>X</sub> in the presence of attacks. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first one the analyst and the adversary share the same training sequence, in the second scenario, they rely on independent sequences. The obtained results are compared with a version of the game in which the pmf P<sub>X</sub> is perfectly known to both the analyst and the adversary.","0018-9448","","","10.1109/TIT.2014.2325571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824190","Hypothesis testing;adversarial signal processing;counter-forensics;cybersecurity;game theory;multimedia forensics;source identification","Forensics;Games;Multimedia communication;Nash equilibrium;Testing;Training","game theory;statistical testing","binary hypothesis testing game;decision error;first order statistics;game asymptotic equilibrium;game-theoretic framework;null hypothesis;probability mass function;test sequence","","1","","37","","2014-06-02","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For such tasks, researchers typically rely on active measurements or large numbers of volunteer users. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach, which we refer to as passive crowd-based monitoring. More specifically, we use passively collected proxy logs from a global enterprise to observe differences in the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users on different continents. We also show how this technique can measure properties of the underlying infrastructures of different Web content providers. While some of these properties have been observed using active measurements, we are the first to show that many of these properties (such as location of servers) can be obtained using passive measurements of actual user activity. Passive crowd-based monitoring has the advantages that it does not add any overhead on Web infrastructure, it does not require any specific software on the clients, but still captures the performance and infrastructure observed by actual Web usage.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363979","","Gold;Google;Monitoring;Quality of service;Servers;Throughput;YouTube","Internet;quality of service","QoS;Web content providers;World Wide Web infrastructure;active measurements;passive crowd-based monitoring;passive measurements;proxy logs;quality of service","","0","","24","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For wired or wireless ad-hoc networks, there exist several automated systems for maintaining their functional integrity.

The modified measurements with the new added ones form a set of measurements that will be used throughout the testing process. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work done for testing IDS in MANET. Simulators are the most common tools used for testing the IDS.

In this paper, we introduce three coefficients, which not only classify the behaviors of flood attacks, but also measure the system performance under those flood attacks: a) attack-density that patterns the characters of flood attack, b) system workload which represents the system capability in handling flood attack and c) the scalability to classify the impact level of the flood attack at victim site.

However, this distributed approach introduces new challenges such as self-organization and efficient communication techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for developing, simulating, and deploying a distributed intrusion detection system that consists of several collaborating agents. The framework provides a programming interface and comprises all essential communication and synchronization methods that enables self-organized collaboration in a completely distributed manner. In two experiments we demonstrate the performance and capabilities of our implementation by simulating a large-scale worm outbreak and a one-to-many attack. Furthermore, we present two applications of our framework to show how collaboration of agents can be used to detect one-to-many attacks and how detection performance benefits from cooperation of agents.","","978-1-4244-3782-5","978-4-9904-2590-6","10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045947","","Application software;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer simulation;Data acquisition;Data analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems","security of data;software agents;synchronisation","collaborative intrusion detection systems;computer network security;conventional centralized intrusion detection systems;distributed intrusion detection;large-scale simulation;programming interface;self-organized collaboration;synchronization methods","","1","","33","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, CAMs are inefficient in matching a numeric range with existing encoding methods. Two-hot, binary and Gray encodings exhibit a depth scalability problem where the CAM depth required increases with the maximum number M in the range. One-hot and Johnson encodings exhibit poor CAM width scalability O(M). We present a unique hybrid encoding scheme mixing the features of two-hot and Johnson codes to solve both scalability problems. For an arbitrary range, it uses only three CAM entries in depth regardless of M, and has a width scaling of O(radicM ).

Computing these metrics using a sample of the trace could potentially save precious time. In this paper, we examine several sampling methods to discover their effects on measurement of the privacy-utility tradeoff when anonymizing network traces. We tested the relative accuracy of several packet and flow-sampling methods on existing privacy and utility metrics. We concluded that, for our test trace, no single sampling method we examined allowed us to accurately measure the tradeoff, and that some sampling methods can produce grossly inaccurate estimates of those values.

The advantages regarding ease of use include reducing the number of low-level system administration tasks, simplifying the system administrator's interface, handling exceptions which would otherwise have resulted in system alerts, and the learning, by the system, of actions taken by the administrator. However, human intervention must still be factored in, and care must be taken in the design of autonomic systems not to make the system administrator's task more difficult. This paper examines the ease-of-use ramifications of autonomic computing in the context of relational databases in general, and of the IBM® DB2® Universal Database™ Version 8.1 autonomic computing system in particular.","0018-8670","","","10.1147/sj.424.0568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5386823","","","","","","0","","","","","2003","","IBM","IBM Journals & Magazines"

It has got so much of importance because of the high optimization of IT resources as a service to the consumers on demand with high availability, flexibility, reliability and scalability. Cloud computing basically converts the desktop computing into service level computing using remote servers or huge datacenter. The cloud computing has lended many user friendly features in terms of various services available through internet but the harsh reality about cloud computing is that they are prone to security threat attacks. One of the major concerning security threats is called Distributed Denial of service attack (DDOS). DDOS attack destroys the ability of the system to provide service by overwhelming the bandwidth of network device and saturating the computation resources of service provider. This paper describes experimental analysis of impact of flooding DDOS attack in cloud environment through simulation in cloudsim. In this experiment we will be defining Infrastructure as service (IaaS) in cloudsim and this IaaS will be deployed in Eucalyptus cloud suite. Simulation of attacks will be carried out on the few VM instances defined in cloudsim and computational parameters of VM are observed for VM with normal operation and VM under attack.","","978-1-4799-3835-3","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033841","Cloudcomputing;Cloudsim;DDOS;Eucalyptus;IaaS","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computer crime;Educational institutions;Floods;Industries;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security;resource allocation;virtual machines","DDOS attack simulation analysis;Eucalyptus cloud suite;IT resources optimization;VM instances;cloud computing;cloud environment;cloudsim;datacenter;desktop computing;distributed denial of service attack;infrastructure as a service;network device bandwidth;remote servers;security threat attacks;service level computing;user friendly features","","0","","22","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If replicas execute identical software, then they share the same vulnerabilities and the whole system can be easily compromised if a single flaw is found. One solution to this problem is to introduce diversity by using different server implementations, but this increases the chances of incompatibility between replicas. This paper studies various kinds incompatibilities and presents a new methodology to evaluate the compliance of diverse server replicas. The methodology collects network traces to identify syntax and semantic violations, and to assist in their resolution. A tool called DiveInto was developed based on the methodology and was applied to three replication scenarios. The experiments demonstrate that DiveInto is capable of discovering various sorts of violations, including problems related with nondeterministic execution.","1060-9857","978-1-4577-1349-1","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076771","diversity;intrusion tolerance;service replication","Correlation;Generators;Protocols;Semantics;Servers;Syntactics;Testing","network servers;security of data;software tools","DiveInto tool;diverse server replica;intrusion tolerant service;intrusion-tolerant system;network trace;nondeterministic execution;replicated system;semantic violation identification;syntax violation identification","","1","","31","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On account of some exclusive features, cloud computing system always differs from the traditional computer system; not only the capabilities but also the vulnerabilities and threats. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a significant component of computer system security and compliance practices that protects computer systems from various types of malicious activities and attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems have been evolved over decades and various types of systems are currently available to identify and eradicate attacks based on different system conditions and different aptitudes. The main purpose of this paper is to review the state-of-art Intrusion Detection Systems available for cloud computing paradigm, which adhere to features of cloud computing architecture. Scalability, elasticity, reliability, performance, security and distributed nature of the Intrusion Detection Systems will be reviewed in order to identify suitable approaches for cloud computing.","","","","10.1109/CCST.2013.6922049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6922049","Cloud Security;Computer System Security;Host based IDS;Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion detection system for cloud computing;Network based IDS","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Computers;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers","cloud computing;security of data","IDS;cloud computing;computer system capability;computer system scalability;computer system usability;intrusion detection systems;malicious activities;malicious attacks","","0","","38","","","8-11 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the hackers are Big Bosses and are very sharp enough to crack the security of the organization. Therefore before they made security breach, let us hunt down them and make the alert for organization, so that they can save their confidential data. For the above mentioned purpose, Intrusion detection system came into existence. But the current systems are not capable enough to detect all the attacks coming towards them. In order to fix the problem of detecting novel attacks and reducing number of false alarm, here in this paper, we have proposed a hybrid model for intrusion detection system, which have enhanced quality of detecting the unknown attack via anomaly based detection and also have module which will try to reduce the number of false alarm generated by the system.","","978-93-80544-10-6","","10.1109/IndiaCom.2014.6828072","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6828072","Intrusion;attack;availability;confidentiality;detection;information;integrity;mitigate","Databases;Decoding;Engines;Hybrid power systems;Intrusion detection;Organizations","security of data","anomaly based detection;confidential data;false alarm reduction;intrusion detection system;one-stop model;organization security;security breach","","0","","25","","","5-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NERC CIP 002-009 requires bulk electric providers to secure critical cyber assets electronically and physically. Transmission and distribution substations contain cyber critical assets including remote terminal units (RTU), intelligent electronic devices (IED) such as relays, phasor measurement units (PMU) and phasor data concentrators (PDC). Substation critical cyber assets are isolated in electronic security perimeters using firewalls. In this paper a retrofit data logger solution for serial communication based MODBUS and DNP3 network appliances is offered. The retrofit data logger allows existing control systems to be updated to log network transactions in support of substation based network intrusion detection. Substation based intrusion detection supports a defense in depth approach to cyber security in which multiple overlapping layers of security are used to protect critical cyber assets. The data logger is an embedded bump-in-the-wire retrofit device which captures, time stamps, cryptographically signs, encrypts, and store network traffic. Network traffic is forwarded to the existing network. Additionally, the data logger architecture supports use of signature based and statistics based intrusion detection algorithms at the network appliance edge.","","978-1-4244-8947-3","","10.1109/PECON.2010.5697717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5697717","Data Logging;Intrusion Detection;Process Control System Cyber Security;SCADA Cyber Security","","SCADA systems;data loggers;security of data;substations","SCADA;distribution substation;intrusion detection system;network traffic;phasor measurement unit;remote terminal unit;retrofit network transaction data logger;serial communication;substation","","5","","9","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
