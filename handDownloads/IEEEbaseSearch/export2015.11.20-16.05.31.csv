In our work, the strength of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and K-means clustering algorithm, both with linear time complexity, are combined to create fast outlier detection. While still maintaining high detection rate and low false alarm rate, our method can easily be paralleled for processing a large data set. The result is then applied with a predefined threshold in order to create efficient intrusion detection. We validated our method against the KDD'99 dataset. With appropriate value of threshold and value of K in KSE test, the results showed the detection rate up to 80% with false alarms less than 10%. While scaling linearly, the accuracy of our method is also improved from those of pure KSE-test-based methods.","","","","10.1109/JCSSE.2015.7219775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219775","Anomaly detection;Clustering;Intrusion detection;Log analysis;Outlier Detection","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computers;Intrusion detection;Time complexity","computational complexity;pattern clustering;security of data;unsupervised learning","K-means clustering algorithm;KSE-test algorithm;Kolmogorov-Smirnov test algorithm;linear time complexity;predefined threshold;scalable outlier detection method;scalable unsupervised intrusion detection method","","0","","20","","","22-24 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first present a distributed algorithm that ensures both coverage of the deployment area and network connectivity by providing multiple cover sets to manage Field of View redundancies. The availability of multiple cover sets leads to a simple but efficient disambigation algorithm.

In this paper, we introduce a new method to the traffic monitoring and anomaly analysis of large networks, namely Structural Equivalence Grouping (SEG). Based on the intrinsic nature of the computer network traffic, SEG condenses the graph by more than 20 times while preserving the critical connectivity information. Computationally, SEG has a linear time complexity and supports undirected, directed and weighted traffic graphs up to a million nodes.

In this paper, we study how intrusions can be detected at the block storage level and in SAN environments. We propose novel approaches for storage-based intrusion detection and discuss how features of state-of-the-art block storage systems can be used for intrusion detection and recovery of compromised data. In particular we present two prototype systems. First we present a real time intrusion detection system (IDS), which has been integrated within a storage management and virtualization system. In this system incoming requests for storage blocks are examined for signs of intrusions in real time. We then discuss how intrusion detection schemes can be deployed as an appliance loosely coupled with a SAN storage system. The major advantage of this approach is that it does not require any modification and enhancement to the storage system software. In this approach, we use the space and time efficient point-in-time copy operation provided by SAN storage devices. We also present performance results showing that the impact of ID on the overall storage system performance is negligible.

In this paper, multiple detection engines with multi-layered intrusion detection mechanisms are proposed. The principle is to coordinate the results from each single-engine intrusion alert system, by seamlessly integrating with the multiple layered distributed service-oriented structure. An improved hidden Markov model (HMM) is created for the detection engine which is capable of the immunology-based self/nonself discrimination. The classifications of normal and abnormal behaviour of system calls are further examined by an advanced fuzzy-based inference process called HPSOWM. Considering a real benchmark dataset from the public domain, our experimental results show that the proposed scheme can greatly shorten the training time of HMM and reduce the false positive rate significantly. The proposed HPSOWM especially works for the efficient classification of unknown behaviors and malicious attacks.","","978-1-4673-0768-0","","10.1109/IB2Com.2011.6217920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217920","","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Engines;Hidden Markov models;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Training","computer network security;fuzzy reasoning;hidden Markov models;particle swarm optimisation;service-oriented architecture;wavelet transforms","HMM;HPSOWM;advanced fuzzy-based inference process;computer networks;false positive rate;hidden Markov model;hybrid particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation approach;immunology-based self-nonself discrimination;large-scale distributed complex network;multilayered intrusion detection mechanisms;multiple detection engines;multiple layered distributed service-oriented structure;nature inspired anomaly detection system;single detection engine based system;single-engine intrusion alert system","","0","","25","","","21-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these needs are traditionally provided through methods of channel encryption and signing, such mechanisms are often difficult or impossible to implement in the ad-hoc, decentralized environments seen in sensor networks, collaborative intrusion detection systems, or other similar peer-to-peer networks. Using the concepts from one-way hashing and language-derived relevance theory, we propose five novel contributions relevant to ad-hoc communications and security: one-way cryptographic hashing as a mechanism for securely communicating in an environment where preexisting shared knowledge exists, hashed shared knowledge messages as a basis for secure formation of self-selecting subgroups and trust building, adding salt to the shared knowledge hashes to remove the static nature of common messages and defend against precomputed table attacks, integration of variable complexity hash functions to dynamically adjust hash complexity relative to message complexity, and a message integrity element based on the secrecy of the original shared knowledge within a hashed message. Although our proposed mechanisms are likely implemented without difficulty from a network and encryption standpoint, they do require significant integration and awareness within the applications relying on them. The method also assumes a static value from a large existing set of shared knowledge, which does not always exist.","","978-1-4577-0980-7","978-0-7695-4459-5","10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032224","hashing;secure communications;shared knowledge","Ad hoc networks;Complexity theory;Encryption;Knowledge engineering;Receivers","ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security","ad-hoc communication;ad-hoc environment;ad-hoc security;channel encryption;channel signing;collaborative intrusion detection system;complexity hash function;decentralized communication network;language-derived relevance theory;message complexity;message confidentiality;message integrity;message-based communication network;one-way cryptographic hashing mechanism;one-way hashing;peer-to-peer network;salted hash;secure communication;sensor network","","1","","29","","","18-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is being widely used in critical infrastructure for monitoring and controlling the activities. The collaborative environment and interconnectivity of SCADA system needs communications and transmission of sensed real time data like status of machines, breaks and leakages in the system across various devices in the industrial plant. Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture. This work also considers the constraints of the SCADA system thereby providing an elegant identification of malicious activities for the current SCADA system.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726619","Aggregation;ICS-Industrial control system;Log Management;SCADA;attack","Computer architecture;Jamming;Magnetic heads;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Sensors","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;industrial control;industrial plants;production engineering computing;security of data;system monitoring","Log analysis approach;SCADA systems;cluster based architecture;cooperative monitoring;critical infrastructure;cyber attacks;human machine interface;industrial automation;industrial plant;malicious activity detection;malicious activity identification;node level;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","1","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%.

While migrating from conventional data centers to cloud computing paradigm, administrators have to consider costs. Security is one of the biggest problems for all information technologies and also in cloud computing. Some mechanisms are used such as antivirus software, firewall, guard systems or intrusion detection/prevention systems to increase the system security. The main handicap of these mechanisms is extensive usage of hardware, especially CPU and memory. In this paper, we examine the hardware usage of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) with different network architectures. Although the virtualization is preferred by the most of the providers, we chose a virtualized environment as our test bed because of its easier implementation structure from other cloud technologies such as grid and blade architectures. We focused on a proxy NIDS architecture, which is a gateway-based approach (intrusion detection assignment carried out by an outer entity, so why we called it proxy) and has less hardware requirements than other positioning options. It is aimed to show an effective location to IDSs in a virtualized environment. As a result, both providers and customers can easily decide where to locate their defense mechanism.","","978-1-4673-5612-1","","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557203","cloud computing;intrusion detection;proxy NIDS;security","Databases;Hardware;Instruction sets;Linux;Logic gates;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtualisation","NIDS architecture;antivirus software;blade architecture;cloud computing paradigm;cloud technologies;conventional data centers;defense mechanism;firewall;gateway-based approach;grid architecture;guard systems;hardware usage;information technologies;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;network architectures;proxy network intrusion detection system;system security;virtualization;virtualized environment","","4","","27","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike the common belief that IDS should be executed as often as possible to cope with insider attacks to prolong the system lifetime, we discover that IDS should be executed at an optimal rate to maximize the mean time to failure of the system. Further, the optimal rate at which IDS is executed depends on the operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behaviors, and IDS techniques used. We develop mathematical models based on Stochastic Petri nets to identify the optimal rate for IDS execution to maximize the mean time to failure of the system, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational conditions, and attacker behaviors.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2010.2040534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5409536","Intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;mean time to security failure;mission-oriented group communication systems;mobile ad hoc networks","","Petri nets;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system techniques;mathematical models;mission execution;mission-oriented mobile group systems reliability;mobile ad hoc networks;stochastic Petri nets","","10","","31","","2010-02-08","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This work presented in this paper proposes a new temporal data mining analysis technique of intrusion detection systems based on naïve Bayes networks. The presented system considered the time dimension and built many different classifier models to obtain an accurate analysis of intruders. The obtained results give more focusing and deep understanding of the intruders' behavior during the different time periods and illustrate the shrinking and expansions of intruders' classes over the time slices (the migrations of intruders from one segment to another), The temporal analysis of intruders can help in taking an appropriate decision against specific type of attacks (decisions must be suitable with the intruder behaviour).

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","1","","34","","2013-04-04","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, by exploiting the location history traversed by a mobile user, two domain-independent online anomaly detection schemes are designed, namely the Lempel-Ziv (LZ)-based and Markov-based detection schemes. The authors focus on the identification of a group of especially harmful internal attackers-masqueraders. For both schemes, cell IDs traversed by each mobile user are extracted as the feature value. Specifically, the mobility pattern of each user is characterized by a high-order Markov model. The LZ-based detection scheme from the well-developed data compression techniques is derived. Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users' behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users' behaviors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they are two of the most important components of mobile users' profiles. To utilize users' calling activities, we formulate the intrusion detection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and call destination are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users' calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model integrating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users' movement patterns. A user's movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users' current movement activities. We simulate users' various behaviors and provide simulation results.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2007.901875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4356991","Bayes decision rule;Bayesian decision rule;instance based learning;instance-based learning (IBL);intrusion detection;wireless network","","belief networks;cellular radio;mobile radio;radio access networks;safety systems;security of data","Bayesian decision rule;Gaussian kernel;Parzen window;cellular mobile systems;class conditional probability density function;fraudulent usage;intrusion detection system;mobile telecommunication services;wireless networks","","6","","27","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on","20070820","2007","","","304","313","Wireless sensor network applications require both energy-efficiency and low latency for reporting urgent but rare events. Various wakeup scheduling schemes have been proposed to save energy by employing duty cycles and to reduce end-to-end delay by synchronizing nodes' wakeup times and shortening setup latencies. Most sensor applications incur a predominant ""convergecast"" traffic pattern in which several close-by sensor nodes simultaneously send reports to the base station, which generates ""spatially-correlated contention."" This contention, specific to sensor networks, can significantly prolong delay, degrade throughput, and impair energy-efficiency. However, most wakeup scheduling and MAC protocols proposed for sensor networks did not address this contention and can be adversely affected. We propose a distributed topology control technique to schedule nodes' wakeup time slots, and design a MAC protocol to benefit from this topology control for improving energy-efficiency and delay, and efficiently handling spatially-correlated contention. Through analysis and simulations, we show that our topology control and MAC can either reduce the end- to-end delay by roughly half or extend the network lifetime by three times, when compared against the nearest competing approach, and achieves twice the throughput under spatially-correlated contention.","","1-4244-1268-4","1-4244-1268-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292842","","Base stations;Degradation;Delay;Distributed control;Energy efficiency;Media Access Protocol;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;wireless sensor networks","MAC protocol;distributed topology control;end- to-end delay;sleep-based topology control;wakeup scheduling;wireless sensor networks","","7","","28","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the efficacies of intrusion aggregations to succinctly process audit logs that are gaining wider acceptability in computer security are flawed because the methods frequently require high level of expertise to validate each alert and the methods only focus on interesting events. Thus, deceptive attacks that are intentionally launched to be uninteresting events frequently elude detections. Consequently, aggregated alerts are not seriously considered for litigation and incident handling exercises. Therefore, this paper presents extensive investigations of these problems.

The arrival of advanced wireless communication device leads to demand in the spectrum and the need to improve utilization of vacant spectrum. In the past decade the spectrum sensing and allocation has been the main focus of research than security in cognitive radio. A selfish cognitive radio node is a serious security issue which occupies a part or full resources (pre-occupation problem) in the multiple channel, and forbids other legitimate cognitive nodes from consuming the resources. This self-centered cognitive radio can critically degrade the performance of the network; so a skillful resource allocation strategy should adopted in order to avoid these selfish attacks in the network. The conventional resource allocation approaches in cognitive network are fully dependent. In this scheme, a coalition game theory used to avoid these selfish attacks with multiple PU's and multiple SU's. The proposed approaches consist of multiple PU's and SU's gathered on a set, in which PU allows the other SU's to make use of its resources in contract or agreement on a timely basis. The PU makes decision to select the optimal SU based on their channel status and the SU act as a relay to PU and help the PU in their transmission of data. This scheme adopts efficient resource allocation in a multichannel cooperative manner due to emerging of many cooperative communication devices. This proposed system follows the core concept and also support shapley value to equally distribute the payoff throughout the users in the network. By this resource allocation approach, the selfish attacks can be prevented in the system and thereby increase the resource utilization efficiency in the network","","978-1-78561-030-1","","10.1049/ic.2013.0363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119750","CRAHN;Shapley value;coalitional game theory;cognitive radio;core;selfish attacks","","ad hoc networks;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;signal detection;telecommunication security","CR;Shapley value;advanced wireless communication device;coalition game theory based resource allocation strategy;cognitive radio ad-hoc networks;cooperative communication devices;intelligent radio;multiple PU;multiple SU;resource utilization efficiency;self-centered cognitive radio;selfish attack avoidance;selfish cognitive radio node;spectrum holes;spectrum sensing","","0","","","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load ""hot-spot"", which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS. Simulation results show that our scheme can achieve significant improvements in load balancing without sacrificing detection accuracy.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-2065-0","978-1-4244-2066-7","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575116","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Load management;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;groupware;invasive software;resource allocation","Internet;collaborative intrusion detection system;coordinated attacks;coordinated defense;detection accuracy;load balancing;load hot-spot;network security;source address;stealthy attacks;suspicious activity pattern;suspicious incoming traffic;workload distribution;worm outbreak;worm spread sources","","2","","14","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the characteristics of multi-source information, complicated data structure in the network security research, this paper puts forward a multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, which is based on improved Analytic Hierarchy Process and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (AHP_FCE), for network security situational assessment. In this method, the hierarchical network index system which consists of three layers, namely, index layer, criterion layer and target layer from bottom to top, is established. The data of the index layer processed by the fuzzy mathematics is obtained from the massive snort alarm information and vulnerability information. The evaluation index weights each layer are calculated by the improved AHP. Comprehensive evaluation is started from the index layer, and by using the evaluation index weights, the factors of security situational are obtained in the criterion layer; by calculating layer by layer upwards, the hosts' security situational values are obtained in the target layer. Finally, the network security situational value is obtained using the hosts' weights. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated using DARPA 2000 data sets.","","978-1-4673-6341-9","","10.1109/ICACI.2013.6748501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748501","","Buffer overflows;Data models;Feature extraction;Ice;Security","computer network security;fuzzy systems","analytic hierarchy process;fuzzy mathematics;massive snort alarm information;multilevel fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model;network security;situational assessment model;vulnerability information","","0","","15","","","19-21 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"We are all treated equal, aren't we? — Flow-level performance as a function of flow size","Mehmood, M.A.; Feldmann, A.; Uhlig, S.; Willinger, W.","KICS, UET, Lahore, Pakistan","Networking Conference, 2014 IFIP","20140717","2014","","","1","9","Recent Internet studies have reported on continued traffic growth, changes in applications usage, and a proliferation in the adoption of high-speed access links. Any adverse impact that these observed trends may have on Internet traffic flows can result in sub par performance, which in turn results in unsatisfactory user experience. To study such adverse impacts, we examine in this paper the flow-level performance of popular applications across a range of size-based flow-classes and applications. We use out-of-sequence packets, retransmissions, throughput, and RTTs as key flow performance metrics. Leveraging data sets collected from two complementary network environments, we compare these metrics for popular applications and for the up/downstream directions. We show that irrespective of the direction, flows are severely impacted by the specifics of the network, e.g., DSL or CDN and application behavior. We also find that, in general, this impact differs markedly across the different flow-classes. In particular, contrary to popular belief, the small flows from all applications, which make up the majority of flows, experience significant retransmissions, while the very large flows, although small in number, experience very limited retransmissions. In terms of application-related performance, we observe that especially when compared to HTTP, apart from large flows, P2P flows suffer from continuously high retransmissions and low throughput. As for the root cause of these retransmissions, we identify the access part of the network as the main culprit and not the network core.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2014.6857100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857100","","DSL;Internet;Measurement;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Throughput","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","CDN;DSL;Internet traffic flows;P2P flows;RTT;application behavior;application-related performance;flow-level performance;high-speed access links;key flow performance metrics;out-of-sequence packets;retransmissions;size-based flow-classes;throughput","","0","","45","","","2-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection. Experimental results show that, even traditional methods fail in some situations, our simple method works well in all cases.","","978-1-4673-1889-1","","10.1109/NAS.2012.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310873","anomaly detection;data mining;grammar-based compression","Compression algorithms;Entropy;Grammar;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Statistical analysis;Training","Markov processes;information theory;security of data;telecommunication security","Markovian method;Markovian model;anomaly detection algorithm;anomaly detection method;bug detection;compression algorithm;data structure;grammar compression;information quantity;information theoretic anomaly detection framework;information theoretic measures;information theory;intrusion detection;lossless compression;network security","","0","","26","","","28-30 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large number of messages are exchanged for key establishment at startup and every time a node join or leave the group to refresh keys. These operations incur huge computation and communication cost that reduces the network life time. To minimize energy consumption and improve network lifetime, this paper presents a lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme (XKFS), which allows refreshing the key without inter node message transmission. A single message containing a magic word is transmitted by the group head to its member nodes and keys are refreshed using XOR and left shift operations. XKFS only requires a light weight message from a more powerful head node and thus eliminates the inter node communication cost. The performance of the XKFS is validated through simulations. Simulation results demonstrate the performance supremacy of XKFS over contemporary schemes in terms of minimizing key freshness operations and energy consumption.","","978-1-4799-8827-3","","10.1109/ITNG.2015.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113467","Energy efficiency;Key freshness;Key management;Secure group communication;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;electronic messaging;private key cryptography;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","XKFS;energy consumption minimization;huge communication cost;huge computation cost;left shift operations;lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme;magic word;message exchange;message transmission;resource constrained WSN;secret key establishment;wireless sensor network life time","","0","","17","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trust is platform-independent and flexible to be seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous domains and interoperate with different security solutions in distributed environments. Establishing trust in a service workflow leads to the willingness of services to participate. Coordinating service workflows without trust consideration may pose higher risks, possibly results in poor performance, additional vulnerabilities, or failures. Although trust in service workflows and relevant contexts has been studied for a past decade, the standard development is still immature. Nowadays, trust approaches to service workflows comprise a large area of research where one can hardly classify into a comprehensive survey.

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064","","Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security","estimation theory;telecommunication security","detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show how to use a tool and some file system knowledge to enable the virtual disk to maintain a sector-to-file mapping table (called file-aware block level storage) as well as how to detect the changes to file content on-line. Based on these features, normal file-level intrusion detection (ID) rules can be converted to sector-level ones in order to integrate ID functions to the virtual storage.

"Cross Layer Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection System","Satam, Pratik","","Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems Workshops (SASOW), 2015 IEEE International Conference on","20151029","2015","","","157","161","Since the start of the 21st century, computer networks have been through an exponential growth in terms of the network capacity, the number of the users and the type of tasks that are performed over the network. With the resent boom of mobile devices (e.g., Tablet computers, smart phones, smart devices, and wearable computing), the number of network users is bound to increase exponentially. But, most of the communications protocols, that span over the 7 layers of the OSI model, were designed in the late 1980's or 90's. Although most of these protocols have had subsequent updates over time, most of these protocols still remain largely unsecure and open to attacks. Hence it is critically important to secure these protocols across the 7 layers of the OSI model. As a part of my PhD research, I am working on a cross layer anomaly behavior detection system for various protocols. This system will be comprised of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for each of the protocols that are present in each layer. The behavior analysis of each protocol will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase (training), the features that accurately characterize the normal operations of the protocol are identified using data mining and statistical techniques and then use them to build a runtime model of protocol normal operations. In addition, some known attacks against the studied protocol are also studied to develop a partial attack model for the protocol. The anomaly behavior analysis modules of each layer are then fused to generate a highly accurate detection system with low false alarms. In the second phase, the cross-layer anomaly based IDS is used to detect attacks against any communication protocols. We have already developed anomaly behavior modules for TCP, UDP, IP, DNS and Wi-Fi protocols. Our experimental results show that our approach can detect attacks accurately and with very low false alarms.","","","","10.1109/SASOW.2015.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7306574","Cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;DNS;Wi-Fi;data mining;machine learning","Conferences;Cross layer design;Databases;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Protocols","","","","","","","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a formal methodology for fingerprinting experiments using which we can model a broad spectrum of fingerprinting problems and design-efficient algorithms. We present a formal behavioral model that specifies a protocol principal by its states and transitions, then identify a complete taxonomy of fingerprint matching and discovery problems is identified based on 1) whether the fingerprinting experiment is active or passive and 2) the information available about the specifications and implementations. Algorithms to solve the problems are discussed. In particular, for fingerprint matching algorithm, we propose an efficient PEFSM online separation algorithm for active experiment and concurrent passive testing for passive experiments. For fingerprint discovery problem, there are two cases: if the protocol specification is available as a nondeterministic PEFSM, we apply across verification and back-tracing technique for active and passive discovery, respectively; if no specification is available, we take the machine learning approach and discover the fingerprint by active testing.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5686874","Formal methods;network level security and protection;network management;protocol verification.","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Data models;Fingerprint recognition;Protocols;Taxonomy;Testing","computer network security;protocols;telecommunication network management","PEFSM online separation algorithm;back-tracing technique;fingerprint discovery problem;fingerprint matching algorithm;formal methodology;machine learning approach;network protocol fingerprinting;network security","","1","","34","","2011-01-13","Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, because of the ubiquitous and pervasive computing paradigm that the WSNs foster and because of the resource constrained characteristic, security & privacy issues therein assume critical investigation. Amongst many potential aspects of investigation, one has been the design of a secure routing protocol in which a value sensed to be delivered to an appropriate receiver securely and efficiently with least amount of energy consumption. We observe that LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a popular clustering based protocol used in WSNs. However, the same lacks any security support. Amongst numerous improvements of LEACH suggested to incorporate security & privacy, we observe that none, to the best of our knowledge offers end-to-end privacy using the homomorphic encryption schemes. We propose here an improvement of LEACH viz. E-LEACH (end-to-end secure LEACH) which uses homomorphic encryption to provide secure data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks.

Because of its portability, extensibility, capabilities, and low-cost, CLIPS has received widespread acceptance. As a production system CLIPS's performance rapidly decreases as the number of working memory elements increases. To address this problem, this paper is aimed at speeding up CLIPS in the case of dealing with large amount of facts and changeable facts. In this paper two measures are adopted to improve CLIP's performance, firstly RETE algorithm which is used as the rule condition-testing algorithm in CLIPS are replaced with TREAT algorithm. Secondly some practical techniques are employed when implementing TREAT algorithm such as recording partial matches, hashing the alpha node, adding rule group. Experimental results show that the two measures can effectively improve CLIPSpsilas performance.","","978-0-7695-3745-0","","10.1109/HIS.2009.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254293","","Artificial intelligence;Databases;Engines;Expert systems;Hybrid intelligent systems;Inference algorithms;Optimization;Performance evaluation;Production systems;Testing","expert systems","CLIPS;RETE algorithm;TREAT algorithm;expert system tool;memory elements;object based expert systems;performance optimization;production system;rule condition-testing","","0","","6","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increases in both the work per network packet and packet rate make it increasingly difficult for general-purpose processor based firewalls to maintain line rate. In a bid to address these evolving requirements we have prototyped a hybrid firewall, using a simple firewall running on a network processor to accelerate a Linux* Netfilter Firewall executing on a general purpose processor. The simple firewall on the network processor provides high rate packet processing for all the packets while the general-purpose processor delivers high rate, full featured firewall processing for those packets that need it. This paper describes the hybrid firewall prototype with a focus on the software created to accelerate Netfilter with a network processor resident firewall. Measurements show our hybrid firewall able to maintain close to 2 Gb/sec line rate for all packet sizes, a significant improvement over the original firewall. We also include the hard won lessons learned while implementing the hybrid firewall.","","978-1-59593-082-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675271","hybrid firewall;netfilter;network firewall;network processor;prototype;throughput","Acceleration;Computer networks;Computer security;Information filtering;Information filters;Linux;Local area networks;Permission;Protection;Prototypes","Linux;authorisation;microprocessor chips","Linux Netfilter firewall;general-purpose processor;network firewalls;network processor acceleration","","1","3","15","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In cloud digital log forensics, work on the forensic reconstruction of evidence on VM hosts system is required, but with the heterogeneous complexity involved with an enterprise's private cloud not to mention public cloud distributed environments, a possible Web Services-centric approach may be required for such log supported investigations. A data cloud log forensics service oriented architecture (SOA) audit framework for this type of forensic examination needs to allow for the reconstruction of transactions spanning multiple VM hosts, platforms and applications. This paper explores the requirements of a cloud log forensics SOA framework for performing effective digital investigation examinations in these abstract web services environments.

The result of such progress leads to an exponential growth in the ability to generate and access to the information. Therefore, there is a need to have both appropriate and specific data. To achieve this goal, data fusion approaches are applied to analyze large scale of heterogeneous data in complex systems. The existing data fusion systems rely generally on human experts but they lack of training dataset for the fusion techniques. Thus, useful autonomous approach should be applied to fuse data automatically and accurately. In this paper, a decision fusion approach based on clustering technique is proposed. This technique enables the generation of composite attack scenarios by selecting events generated by analyzers while considering their efficiency to detect attacks using defined efficiency criteria. The general system architecture is presented to allocate the data fusion component within the network. Then, the core functioning and the characteristics of the data fusion component are presented.","","978-1-4577-0383-6","978-0-7695-4388-8","10.1109/CIT.2011.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6036822","Data fusion;analyzer;clustering;decision fusion;intrusion detection","Analytical models;Clustering algorithms;Data models;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Servers","decision making;information systems;pattern clustering;security of data;sensor fusion","clustering data fusion method;complex systems;decision fusion approach;information systems;intrusion detection system;training dataset","","0","","12","","","Aug. 31 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An examination of current software-engineering approaches to self-organizing MAS identified a lack of requirement engineering approaches, established in general- purpose engineering methodologies. As self-organizing dynamics are typically utilized to enforce continuous MAS adjustment we discuss how expectations on MAS adaptivity can be expressed and validated, considering both the intended system configurations as well as the system dynamics that steer system (re-)configuration. We argue that self-organizing MAS development typically intends recurring pattern of system dynamics and exemplify their specification and validation, transferring requirements engineering practices to self-organizing MAS development.","","0-7695-2906-2","","10.1109/SASO.2007.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4274917","","Adaptive systems;Application software;Best practices;Computer science;Design engineering;Laboratories;Multiagent systems;Multimedia systems;Organizing;Robustness","multi-agent systems;self-adjusting systems;software engineering;stability","adaptive system behaviors;interacting autonomous agents;pro-active agents;robust system;self organizing multi-agent systems;software engineering","","3","","22","","","9-11 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the literature, only a few efforts proposed a method to detect evasion attacks at high speed without reassembly. The aim of this article is to introduce an efficient system for anti-evasion that can be implemented in real devices. It is based on counting bloom filters and exploits their capabilities to quickly update the string set and deal with partial signatures. In this way, the detection of attacks and almost all of the traffic processing is performed in the fast data path, thus improving the scalability of intrusion detection systems.","0890-8044","","","10.1109/MNET.2009.4804321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804321","","Costs;Counting circuits;Databases;Matched filters;Out of order;Pattern matching;Payloads;Wire","IP networks;digital signatures;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP fragmentation;TCP;anti-evasion;attack detection;counting bloom filter;deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;network security;partial signature;pattern matching;string set;traffic processing;wire speed","","6","2","12","","","January-February 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Denial-of-service attacks have been successful in denying legitimate traffic access to its required resources because existing routing protocols treat the attacking traffic equally as any normal traffic. This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic. We demonstrate through several examples, how our approach can dynamically detect attacks, quantify their impact, and how to reduce the impacts and recover from them.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514527","Abnormality distance (AD);network attack;proactive defense;quality-of-protection (QoP)","Computer crime;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","DiffServ networks;Internet;authorisation;fault diagnosis;monitoring;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AD metric;Internet infrastructure;QoP;QoS protocol;abnormality distance;automatic technique;denial-of-service attack;differentiated service;network fault;network traffic flow;online monitoring;proactive defense network;quality-of-protection;quality-of-service;routing protocol;self-protection mechanism","","8","1","59","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
