Due to these advancements more and more services are available for malicious exploitation. New vulnerabilities are found from common programs and even on vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network of an entire company. There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator. Then their performance has been analyzed using 10 classification algorithms. Finally the top ten combinations of feature selection have been evaluated among 1585 unique combinations. Combination of Symmetric and Gain Ratio while considering top 15 attributes has highest performance.","","978-1-4799-7682-9","","10.1109/PDGC.2014.7030720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030720","Boolean AND operator;Data Mining;Feature Selection Techniques;Garret's Ranking Technique;Intrusion Detection System;NSL-KDD Dataset;WEKA","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training;Vegetation","Boolean functions;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","Boolean AND operator;IDS;classification algorithms;combinational feature selection approach;malicious network traffic detection;network intrusion detection system;ranking based feature selection techniques","","0","","26","","","11-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several localization approaches have been proposed but most of them omit to consider that WSNs could be deployed in adversarial settings, where hostile nodes under the control of an attacker coexist with faithful ones. Verifiable multilateration (VM) was proposed to cope with this problem by leveraging on a set of trusted landmark nodes that act as verifiers. Although VM is able to recognize reliable localization measures, it allows for regions of undecided positions that can amount to the 40 percent of the monitored area. We studied the properties of VM as a noncooperative two-player game where the first player employs a number of verifiers to do VM computations and the second player controls a malicious node. The verifiers aim at securely localizing malicious nodes, while malicious nodes strive to masquerade as unknown and to pretend false positions. Thanks to game theory, the potentialities of VM are analyzed with the aim of improving the defender's strategy. We found that the best placement for verifiers is an equilateral triangle with edge equal to the power range R, and maximum deception in the undecided region is approximately 0.27R. Moreover, we characterizedâin terms of the probability of choosing an unknown node to examine furtherâthe strategies of the players.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560057","Game theory;localization games;security;wireless sensor networks","Electronic mail;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;Robustness;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;security of data;wireless sensor networks","VM;game theory;malicious node;node localization;noncooperative two-player game;probability;security games;trusted landmark nodes;verifiable multilateration;wireless sensor networks","","0","","42","","2013-07-16","Jan.-Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This specification also includes the description of an architecture that explains how the policy decision point (PDP) retrieves the needed attributes values when it evaluates the policy to take its authorization decision. In this paper, we show this approach for getting the attributes values is a bottleneck to the performance of the authorization decision-making-process for attributes whose process for retrieving the value is long and the changing of its value doesn't impact the policy frequently.

It is therefore desirable to automate as much as possible the firewall configuration process. Accordingly, this work presents a new more active and scalable fire walling architecture based on dynamic and adaptive policy management facilities, thus enabling the automatic generation of new rules and policies, to ensure a timely response in detecting unusual traffic activity and identify unknown potential attacks (0day). The proposed scheme, structured in a multi-stage modular fashion, can be easily applied in a distributed security environment, and does not depend on specific security solutions or hardware/software packages.","","978-1-4244-8448-5","978-0-7695-4236-2","10.1109/BWCCA.2010.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633666","Adaptive Policy Management;Firewall Management and Design;Multi-Firewall Systems;Network Protection","Fires;IP networks;Object oriented modeling;Optimization;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Security","computer network management;computer network security","enhanced firewall scheme;firewall policies management;firewall security;security threats","","1","","10","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, a classification method is introduced to perform this discrimination based on self organizing network (SOM) classifier. Also, rather than proving well-known abilities of SOM on classification, our main concern in this work was investigating effects of principal component analysis on quality of feature vectors. In order to signify the power of success, KDD Cup 1999 dataset is used. KDD Cup dataset is a common benchmark for evaluation of intrusion detection techniques. The dataset consists of several components and here, it is used `10% corrected' test dataset. Since the feature vectors obtained from the dataset have prominent impact of success on the method, the usage of PCA and a method of choosing reliable components are introduced. At the end it is mentioned that the success of decision by the proposed method has been improved. In order to clarify this improvement, a detailed comparison of changing number of principal components on the success of decision mechanism is given.","","978-0-7695-3736-8","","10.1109/ICNC.2009.652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363888","DoS;PCA;SOM","Application software;Computer applications;Computer networks;Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Self organizing feature maps","authorisation;computer network security;principal component analysis;self-organising feature maps;vectors","KDD Cup dataset;classification method;feature vector;intrusion detection technique;network anomaly detection;principal component analysis;self organizing network classifier;self-organizing maps","","0","1","7","","","14-16 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new approach of building micro-firewalls on network hosts to enable distributed intrusion detection with dynamic policy change, as the threat pattern changes. This distributed security can effectively counteract attacks from intruders or insiders. Three policy-update mechanisms are evaluated for achieving dynamic security. Mobile agents are shown most scalable and robust for policy update, but prone to attacks by other agents or hosts. The CORBA has the best speed performance with lower overhead The Java-based RMI demonstrates the highest security based on the sandbox model. The optimal choice depends on the tradeoffs among operating speed, Intranet scalability, host robustness, and the security level demanded by specific network applications","","0-7695-1432-4","","10.1109/NCA.2001.962517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=962517","","Buildings;Computer architecture;Computer security;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Java;Mobile agents;Protection;Robustness;Scalability","authorisation;computer networks;security of data;software agents","CORBA;Intranet scalability;Mobile agents;RMI;clusters of computers;distributed security;distributed security architecture;dynamic policy change;dynamic security;exposed Intranets;host robustness;intrusion detection;micro-firewalls;operating speed;policy-update mechanisms;sandbox model;security level","","8","75","22","","","2001","08 Oct 2001-10 Oct 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, modern security systems that are applied in today's highly dynamic ICT networks, including malware scanners and intrusion detection systems, apply a kind of black-list approach, where they consider only actions and behavior that match to well-known attack patterns and signatures of malware traces. We argue that for the smart grid a more restrictive approach, that cannot be circumvented by customized malware, will increase the security level tremendously. Therefore, in this paper we present a smart white-list approach. Our anomaly detection technique keeps track of system events, their dependencies and occurrences, and thus learns the normal system behavior over time and reports all actions that differ from the created system model. The application of such a system is promising in a smart grid environment which mostly implements well-specified processes, resulting in rather predictable and static behavior. We demonstrate the application of the system in a small-scale pilot case of a real utility provider.","","","","10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816388","anomaly detection;event correlation;ict security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Malware;Privacy;SCADA systems;Smart grids","invasive software;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","Internet;access points;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection technique;attack patterns;black-list approach;electricity grid;intrusion detection systems;malware scanners;malware trace signatures;security level;security systems;smart grid ICT networks;smart white-list approach;system event tracking;utility provider","","2","","10","","","19-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we evaluate a proposed technique to measure the relative similarity or level of maliciousness between different categories of malicious network streams captured by honeynets. This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets.

Basically, Internet was built with the focus on its functionality and not with the focus on the security tasks. This has led to discovering embedded weaknesses in Internet architecture, which can be misused by attackers with malicious purposes. This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","5","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result.

One important specification of such systems is high availability. Recent attacks to ICS illustrate that almost any cyber attack can be orchestrated on these systems. Current security techniques, tools, and methods cannot prevent these cyber attacks. Attacks may finally lead to malfunctioning or even disabling the ICS for a long time. The consequences are financial loss and in some cases, catastrophic events affecting our lives. Two solutions can improve the availability: increasing the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) or decreasing the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Current approaches which try to improve the security of ICS use the first solution. Nevertheless, decreasing the MTTR is more effective thus a recovery scheme for ICS is proposed here. Using the proposed scheme, the ICS is recovered from a compromised state and is put into a stable state. Preliminary experiments show that this scheme can significantly decrease the MTTR and improve the ICS availability.","","978-1-4673-6489-8","","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620079","Industrial Control System;Recovery;Security;System availability","Availability;Control systems;Educational institutions;Industrial control;Security;Servers;Workstations","industrial control;reliability;system recovery","ICS availability;MTTF;MTTR;cyber attack;industrial control systems;mean time to failure;mean time to recovery;recovery scheme","","0","","17","","","28-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current literature for CBAS primarily focuses on the accuracy of the system in order to reduce false alarms. However, these attempts do not consider various issues that might affect practicality in real world applications and continuous authentication scenarios. One of the main issues is that the presented CBAS are based on several samples of training data either of both intruder and valid users or only the valid users' profile. This means that historical profiles for either the legitimate users or possible attackers should be available or collected before prediction time. However, in some cases it is impractical to gain the biometric data of the user in advance (before detection time). Another issue is the variability of the behaviour of the user between the registered profile obtained during enrollment, and the profile from the testing phase. The aim of this paper is to identify the limitations in current CBAS in order to make them more practical for real world applications. Also, the paper discusses a new application for CBAS not requiring any training data either from intruders or from valid users.","","978-1-4244-8335-8","978-0-7695-4214-0","10.1109/HPCC.2010.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581430","Authentication;Continuous Biometric;Impostor;Intruder;Security","","authorisation;behavioural sciences;biometrics (access control);computer crime","continuous biometric authentication;user behavioural characteristics;user profile","","1","","22","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To alleviate these issues, in this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting cyber-physical anomalies in NCIs using the concept of Cyber-physical data fusion. By employing Dempster-Shafer's “Theory of Evidence” we combine knowledge from the cyber and physical dimension of NCIs in order to achieve an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) capable to detect even small disturbances that are not detected by traditional approaches.

In network intrusions, there may be multiple computing nodes that are attacked by intruders. The evidences of intrusions have to be gathered from all such attacked nodes. An intruder may move between multiple nodes in the network to conceal the origin of attack, or misuse some compromised hosts to launch the attack on other nodes. To detect such intrusion activities spread over the whole network, we present a new intrusion detection system (IDS) called distributed intrusion detection using mobile agents (DIDMA). DIDMA uses a set of software entities called mobile agents that can move from one node to another node within a network, and perform the task of aggregation and correlation of the intrusion related data that it receives from another set of software entities called the static agents. Mobile agents reduce network bandwidth usage by moving data analysis computation to the location of the intrusion data, support heterogeneous plat-forms, and offer a lot of flexibility in creating a distributed IDS. DIDMA utilizes the above-mentioned beneficial features offered by mobile agent technology and addresses some of the issues with centralized IDS models. The detailed architecture and implementation of a prototype of DIDMA are described. It has been tested using some well-known attacks and performances have been corn-pared with centralized IDS models.","","0-7695-2294-7","","10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434895","Intrusion detection;and distributed systems;distributed attacks;mobile agents;network security","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Data analysis;Distributed computing;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Prototypes;Software performance","Internet;computer crime;mobile agents;telecommunication security","DIDMA;Internet;computer networks;distributed attack;distributed intrusion detection system;mobile agents;network intrusion;network security;software entities","","12","1","18","","","23-25 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How do you know if you are providing appropriate resources or not? In this paper we analyze which Security aspects can be measured and how. Several sets of parameters are proposed to be considered, in order to analyze the Security resources of an Organization: Effectiveness (incidents and the success of his rejection); Efficiency (money, people, work hours); Performance (equipment breakdowns attendance times, officers absenteeism, etc.); Evolution of the threats addressed (incidents and attempts); Maturity of the resources (projects planned, implemented, on operation, audited). The existence of a methodology for measuring Security is essential in the implementation of a risk management system focused on continuous improvement. Measuring Security is a key to propose organizational goals and generate benchmarking among different branches or at different moments.

It uses a bi-path routing algorithm to decrease the computational overhead as well as energy dissipation in the nodes. A key pre-distribution scheme is proposed such that nodes in the route share keys while those that are not in the route do not share keys with nodes that are in the route. Simulations have been done for both small and large areas, low and high density, on-route and non-route connectivity scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol not only provides security but also maximizes sensor network lifetime and achieves a high probability of connectivity, particularly when the network is large.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296048","Sensor Networks;routing;security","Base stations;Clustering algorithms;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;pattern clustering;probability;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","SSBCR;WSN;computational overhead;connectivity probability;high-density connectivity scenarios;key predistribution scheme;key sharing;large-area connectivity scenarios;low-density connectivity scenarios;node energy dissipation;nonroute connectivity scenarios;on-route connectivity scenarios;secured sector-based bipath clustering and routing protocol;small-area connectivity scenarios;wireless sensor network lifetime maximization","","1","","20","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naïve Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Management of these processors and other system resources to achieve high forwarding rates is a key challenge. In particular, the allocation of processing workloads and the placement of data structures in memory have an enormous impact on system performance. Our work proposes a runtime system that manages these system resources. Much related work has proposed the use of cache memory hierarchies in packet processors.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources. Our results are important for the development of secure access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access of communication networks from malicious users.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2398834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066967","Particle filters;intrusion detections;networked multi-robot systems;target tracking","Base stations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Robot kinematics;Trajectory;Wireless communication","RSSI;mobile robots;optimisation;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio transceivers;radionavigation","Cramer-Rao lower bounds;centralized coordinated motion algorithm;distributed protocol;gradient vectors;heuristic approach;mobile robots;optimized trajectory;particle filters;position estimation;rapid wireless tracking verification;received signal strength measurements;suboptimal approach","","0","","","","2015-03-24","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The performance of an intrusion detection system is dependent on two metrics: throughput and the total number of patterns that can fit on a device. In this paper, we consider the FPGA implementation details of the bit-split string-matching architecture. The bit-split algorithm allows large hardware state machines to be converted into a form with much higher memory efficiency. We extend the architecture to satisfy the requirements of the IDS state-of-the-art. We show that the architecture can be effectively optimized for FPGA implementation. We have optimized the pattern memory system parameters and developed new interface hardware for communicating with an external controller. The overall performance (bandwidth * number of patterns) is competitive with other memory-based string matching architectures implemented in FPGA.","","1-4244-0054-6","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639434","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Control systems;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Software performance;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","bit-split string-matching architecture;field-programmable gate array;hardware state machine;interface hardware;intrusion detection system;network security;pattern memory system parameter;reconfigurable hardware","","11","1","20","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Bayesian method has been used in the past on weather forecasting and has been expanded so that it can be used to provide enhanced network security by trying to predict user actions. For this a system can determine if a user is acting unpredictably or has changed their normal working pattern.

In practice, TRAs can be executed in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks using the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function. This attack is easy to perform yet hard to prevent. We propose a distributed discouragement scheme based on the threat of TRA detection and punishment. The scheme does not rely on station identities or a trusted third party, nor does it require tampering with the MAC protocol. We analyze an arising non-cooperative TRA game and find that under certain realistic assumptions it only incentivizes TRAs if they are harmless to other stations; otherwise the selfish stations are induced to learn that TRAs are counterproductive.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2321577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810022","Ad hoc networks;EDCA;IEEE 802.11;QoS;game theory;selfish behavior;traffic remapping attack","Ad hoc networks;Games;IEEE 802.11 Standards;IP networks;Quality of service;Throughput;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;game theory;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;wireless channels","EDCA;IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network;TRA detection;TRA punishment;class-based approach;distributed discouragement scheme;enhanced distributed channel access;false intrinsic traffic class designation;higher traffic priority class;local ad hoc network;noncooperative TRA game;quality of service;traffic remapping attack","","0","","38","","2014-05-02","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","","978-1-4799-7324-8","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","0","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose new NFA-Split architecture, which reduces the amount of consumed FPGA resources in order to match larger set of regular expressions at multi-gigabit speed. The proposed reduction uses model of nondeterministic and deterministic automaton for effective mapping of regular expressions to FPGA. A new algorithm is designed to split the nondeterministic automaton transition table in order to map a part of the table into memory. The algorithm can place more than 49% of transition table to memory, which reduces the amount of look-up tables by more than 43% and flip-flops by more than 38% for all selected sets of regular expressions. Moreover, a sparse transition table is mapped to memory with overlapped rows, which enables to store the table in a highly compact form.","","978-1-4244-6612-2","","10.1109/DDECS.2010.5491816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491816","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Field programmable gate arrays;Flip-flops;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;deterministic automata;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching","FPGA;NFA-Split architecture;deterministic automaton;fast regular expression matching;flip flops;intrusion detection systems;look-up tables;malicious attacks;network attacks;nondeterministic automaton transition table;pattern matching;sparse transition table;viruses","","2","","21","","","14-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423","","Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization","computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic","asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate","","0","","21","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The automation system usually contains a rather accurate time source, which could be used to derive the time base for all system components, including the above-mentioned security mechanisms. A number of standard protocols exist for time synchronization. It will be shown that these protocols do not fulfill the necessary security requirements.

One positive example to thousands of negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning treats the extremely small instances as noise. The standard approach for this difficulty is balancing training data by resampling them. However, this results in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing majority instances by partitioning them into clusters. This greatly reduces the ambiguity between minority instances and instances in each cluster. For moderately high imbalance ratio and low in-class complexity, our technique gives better prediction accuracy than undersampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio like splice site prediction problem, we demonstrate that this technique serves as a good filter with almost perfect recall that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed and yield significant improvements over previous predictor. We also show that the technique works for sub cellular localization and post-translational modification site prediction problems.","","0-7695-2457-5","","10.1109/ICHIS.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587765","","Application software;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Genomics;Machine learning;Proteins;Supervised learning;Testing;Training data;Unsupervised learning","biology computing;genetics;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","data imbalance;functional genomics;machine learning;post-translational modification site prediction;subcellular localization;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","","2","","21","","","6-9 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Stateful Mechanism for the Tree-Rule Firewall","Chomsiri, T.; Xiangjian He; Nanda, P.; Zhiyuan Tan","Sch. of Comput. & Commun., Univ. of Technol., Sydney, NSW, Australia","Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom), 2014 IEEE 13th International Conference on","20150119","2014","","","122","129","In this paper, we propose a novel connection tracking mechanism for Tree-rule firewall which essentially organizes firewall rules in a designated Tree structure. A new firewall model based on the proposed connection tracking mechanism is then developed and extended from the basic model of Net filter's Conn Track module, which has been used by many early generation commercial and open source firewalls including IPTABLES, the most popular firewall. To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed. Finally, we implement this model on Linux Cent OS 6.3 and evaluate its speed. The experimental results show that our model performs more efficiently in comparison with the Net filter/IPTABLES.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011242","Connection Tracking;Firewall;Network Security;Stateful firewall;Tree-rule firewall","Computational modeling;Filtering;Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Memory management;Ports (Computers)","Linux;firewalls","IPTABLES;Linux Cent OS 6.3;Netfilter ConnTrack module;Netfilter model;connection tracking mechanism;designated tree structure;firewall rules;generation commercial;hashing bits;memory space;open source firewalls;stateful mechanism;tree-rule firewall model","","0","","24","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the paper, we present an improved proxy signature scheme based on bionic evolution. In the scheme, the original private key is generated with bionic evolution algorithm by a successive optimizing process. The optimizing selection algorithm renders effective protection for the private key and the signature system, avoids the insecure randomness in secret parameter selection, and thus prevents generalized signature forgery and coalition attack of original signer and proxy signers. The algorithms of the scheme take great advantage of the superiority of ECC (Elliptic Curves Cryptosystem), such as high efficiency, short key length and etc. The scheme can achieve the same security with less storing space, smaller communication band-width and less overheads of the system and thus proves to be applicable to such circumstances as with restricted computation ability and integrated space, circumstances with limited bandwidth yet requiring for high-speed operation.","","978-1-4244-5339-9","","10.1109/FITME.2009.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381003","bionic evolution;elliptic curves;private key optimization;proxy signature;system efficiency","Application software;Bandwidth;Conference management;Educational institutions;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Information technology;Polynomials;Public key cryptography;Stability","artificial intelligence;evolutionary computation;private key cryptography;random processes","adaptive artificial intelligence technique;bionic evolution algorithm;bionic optimization;coalition attack;communication bandwidth;computation ability;elliptic curves cryptosystem;generalized signature forgery;insecure randomness;natural evolution process;optimizing selection algorithm;original signer;private key;proxy signature schemes;proxy signers;secret parameter selection;signature system","","0","","28","","","13-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection and prevention systems use different methodologies such as signature based, anomaly based, stateful protocol analysis, and a hybrid system that combines some or all of the other systems to detect and respond to security threats. The growth of systems that use a combination of methods creates some confusion when trying to choose a methodology and system to deploy.

The key idea is to take advantage of different classification abilities of neural network and the C4.5 algorithm for different attacks. What is more, the model could also be updated by the C4.5 rules mined from the dataset after the event (intrusion). We employ data from the third international knowledge discovery and data mining tools competition (KDDcup '99) to train and test feasibility of our proposed model. From our experimental results with different network data, our model achieves more than 85 percent detection rate on average, and less than 19.7 percent false alarm rate for five typical types of attacks. Through the analysis after-the-event module, the average detection rate of 93.28 percent and false positive rate of 0.2 percent can respectively be obtained.","","0-7803-8131-9","","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259925","","Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;Data mining;Electronic mail;Information security;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Neural networks;Space technology;Testing","backpropagation;data mining;decision trees;neural nets;security of data;telecommunication security","C4.5 algorithm;back propagation;decision tree;hybrid neural network;intrusion detection technology;misuse detection;network security","","6","1","11","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main goal of this paper is to reduce the huge volume of management tasks inherent to this type of network services, as well as facilitating the design of DIDS whose managing complexity could be restricted within well-defined margins. This paper also addresses the construction of a physical sensor prototype.

We then identify primitive elements in these rules in order to translate the rules into their (equivalent) logical forms and to establish connections between them. Additional rules from background knowledge are also introduced to make the correlations among rules more explicit. Finally, we measure the degree of inconsistency in formulae of such a rule set (using the Scoring function, Shapley inconsistency values and Blame measure for prioritized knowledge) and compare the in formativeness of these measures. We conclude that such measures are useful for the network intrusion domain assuming that incorporating domain knowledge for correlation of rules is feasible.","1529-4188","978-1-4577-0982-1","","10.1109/DEXA.2011.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059840","Network intrusion detection;inconsistency measures","Atomic measurements;Correlation;Databases;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching","game theory;pattern matching;security of data","Blame prioritized knowledge measure;Shapley inconsistency values;domain knowledge;inconsistency handling;inconsistency measurement;network intrusion detection rule set inconsistency;regular expression pattern matching;scoring function","","0","","10","","","Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
