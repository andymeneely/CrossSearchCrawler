Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131","IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow","Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN","","3","","16","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inefficiency is often attributed to high overhead and this is caused by several reasons. Among them are continuous detection and the use of full feature set to look for intrusive patterns in the network packet. The purpose of this paper are; to address the issue of continuous detection by introducing traffic monitoring mechanism and a lengthy detection process by selectively choose significant features to represent a network connection. In traffic monitoring, a new recognition paradigm is proposed in which it minimizes unnecessary recognition. Therefore, the purpose of traffic monitoring is two-folds; to reduce amount of data to be recognized and to avoid unnecessary recognition. Empirical results show 30 to 40 percent reduction of normal connections is achieved in DARPA KDDCup 1999 datasets. Finally we assembled Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System and Linear Genetic Programming to form an ensemble classifiers.

Fuelled by recent advances in networking, communications, computation, software, and hardware technologies, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is considered as the next breakthrough technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. However, realising a network of physical objects accessed through the Internet brings a potential threat in the shadow of the numerous benefits. The threat is “security”. Given that Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) leverage the potential of IoT quite efficiently, this paper faces the challenge of security attention on a particular, yet broad, context of IP-enabled WSNs. In particular, it proposes a novel threat visualisation tool for such networks, called VisIoT. VisIoT is a human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system that is capable of monitoring and promptly detecting several devastating forms of security attacks, including wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. Based on a rigorous, radial visualisation design, VisIoT may expose adversaries conducting one or multiple concurrent attacks against IP-enabled WSNs. The system's visual and anomaly detection efficacy in exposing complex security threats is demonstrated through a number of simulated attack scenarios.","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247576","","Data visualization;Engines;Monitoring;Routing;Security;Visualization;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;data visualisation;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IP-enabled WSN;Internet of Things;IoT systems security;Sybil attacks;VisIoT;complex security threats;concurrent attacks;hardware technologies;human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system;physical objects;radial visualisation design;security attacks;simulated attack scenarios;software technologies;threat visualisation tool;visual detection efficacy;wireless sensor networks;wormhole attacks","","","","11","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we tried to propose a very simple and fast feature selection method to eliminate features with no helpful information on them. Result faster learning in process of redundant feature omission. We compared our proposed method with three most successful similarity based feature selection algorithm including Correlation Coefficient, Least Square Regression Error and Maximal Information Compression Index.

Firstly, the image energy model is established, the energy minimization constraint technology is used to make the average output energy of local image area be minimum, and the infrared image noise and clutter signal are suppressed. The directional gradient features of infrared target are extracted, and the potential small targets can be identified with its direction gradient in sequential frames. The multiple frames determination results are obtained, and the fusion result is used to detect the target. Simulation result shows that the algorithm does not need the prediction of background, and it can overcome the interference of cloud in high altitude sky with low SNR, the small target detection accuracy is improved greatly.

"A Distributed Hierarchical Policy Management System for Security Control over Tactical Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","Kirthika Parmeswaran; Coan, B.; Burns, Jim; Mouchtaris, P.; Lucas, Stephen W.","Telcordia Technologies","Military Communications Conference, 2007. MILCOM 2007. IEEE","20080222","2007","","","1","9","Tactical mobile ad hoc wireless networks can provide flexibility, agility, and mobility for dynamic network-centric warfare. They are designed to function without fixed infrastructure support. But, this design makes network security attacks hard to detect and control. For instance, an attacker could compromise one portion of the network by inducing a worm and then move to another portion of the network and replay the attack without being detected. In this paper, we describe a policy management system (PMS) that provides ubiquitous and consistent security policy control despite adverse conditions such as node mobility, node failures, network partitions, a compromise of the routing infrastructure, a high packet loss rate, and ongoing cyber attacks. We give performance results in a 47-node emulated network. Key challenges in tactical networks include a lossy environment with bit error rates as high as 0.001 and bandwidth as low as 500Kbits/s. TCP backs off in the face of packet loss and hence behaves poorly in such networks. Tactical network are also subject to cyber attacks that have the potential even to compromise the routing infrastructure. Our PMS architecture mitigates these issues by using a transport protocol that has two components, one oriented toward normal operation when the routing infrastructure is functioning and one oriented toward limited, but robust, operation even when the routing infrastructure has been compromised. In normal operation we use a reliable UDP protocol (RUDP) and in times of compromise we use a flooding protocol.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455069","","Bandwidth;Bit error rate;Computer security;Control systems;Floods;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Transport protocols;Wireless networks","","","","2","","13","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first formalize implicit trust relations of the AODV protocol. Then, we show that, given these relations, a node is able to reason on the actions performed by its neighbors and so deduce information about their knowledge.

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn.

In this paper the performance of a Machine Learning algorithm called Decision Tree (J48) is evaluated and compared with two other Machine Learning algorithms namely Neural Network and Support Vector Machines which has been conducted by A. Osareh [1] for detecting intrusion. The algorithms were tested based on accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate and accuracy of four categories of attacks. From the experiments conducted, it was found that the Decision tree (J48) algorithm outperformed the other two algorithms.","","978-1-4244-7579-7","978-1-4244-7578-0","10.1109/ICNIT.2010.5508526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508526","Decision Tree;KDD 99;Machine Learning;Neural Network;Support Vector Machines","Decision trees;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Protection;Support vector machines;Testing","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","decision tree algorithm;intrusion detection system;machine learning algorithms performance;network intrusion detection;network security technology;neural network;support vector machines","","1","","13","","","11-12 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we presented a novel approach to have a high detection rate and very low false positives and false negatives in the classification of network traffic using jaccords coefficient (JC) similarity.

Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes. Moreover, it achieves close to the linear speedup by improving the intrusion detection and false alarm rates.","","978-1-4799-0453-2","978-1-4799-0452-5","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557670","","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Particle swarm optimization;Testing;Vectors","computer network security;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering","MapReduce intrusion detection system;anomaly fragments discover;commodity hardware;computer networks;false alarm rates;initial cluster centroids;large data sets;particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm;premature convergence;sensitivity problem","","2","","20","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method is based on a goal-oriented framework for generating and resolving obstacles to goal satisfaction. The extended framework addresses malicious obstacles (called anti-goals) set up by attackers to threaten security goals. Threat trees are built systematically through anti-goal refinement until leaf nodes are derived that are either software vulnerabilities observable by the attacker or anti-requirements implementable by this attacker. New security requirements are then obtained as countermeasures by application of threat resolution operators to the specification of the anti-requirements and vulnerabilities revealed by the analysis. The paper also introduces formal epistemic specification constructs and patterns that may be used to support a formal derivation and analysis process.

In preparation for a course on intrusion detection systems (IDS), the instructor creates pre-configured virtual machines and network trace files for studentspsila use. These virtual machines are then installed by the students on their personal computers at home and used to conduct lab exercises. The virtual lab approach is different from the centralized remote laboratory because students run the lab on their own computers and do not depend on the remote servers. Additionally, the virtual environments allow rapid changes to be made to the lab exercises or environments thus allowing instruction with up-to-date technologies. Furthermore, the burden of maintaining centralized physical labs has been lifted from the institutionpsilas shoulders.

The basic idea behind IMS is convergence; providing a single interface to different traditional or modern networking architectures allowing better working environment for the end users. IMS is still not commercially adopted and used but research is in progress to explore it. IMS is an IP based overlay next generation network architecture. It inherent number of security threats of session initiation protocol (SIP), TCP, UDP etc as it uses SIP and IP protocols. Some of them can degrade the performance of IMS seriously and may cause DoS or DDoS attacks. The paper presents a new approach keeping a vision of secure IMS based on intrusion detection system (IDS) using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) as classifier. The KNN classifier can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate. It can distinguish between the normal behavior of the system or abnormal. In this paper, we have focused on the key element of IMS core known as proxy call session control function (PCSCF). Network based anomaly detection mechanism is proposed using KNN as anomaly detector. Experiments are performed on OpenIMS core and the result shows that IMS is vulnerable to different types of attacks such as UDP flooding, IP spoofing that can cause DoS.

If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a ""unsafe zone"" to isolate user's SQL queries from a ""safe zone"" of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones. Both our analytical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our isolation techniques against data corruption attacks to the databases.

The distributed nature of the network makes centralized intrusion detection difficult, while resource constraints of the nodes and the characteristics of the wireless medium often render decentralized, node-based approaches impractical. We demonstrate that an active-probing-based network intrusion detection system (AP-NIDS) is practical for WMNs. The key contribution of this paper is to optimize the active probing process: we introduce a general Bayesian model and design a probe selection algorithm that reduces the number of probes while maximizing the insights gathered by the AP-NIDS. We validate our model by means of testbed experimentation. We integrate it to our open source AP-NIDS DogoIDS and run it in an indoor wireless mesh testbed utilizing the IEEE 802.11s protocol. For the example of a selective packet dropping attack, we develop the detection states for our Bayes model, and show its feasibility. We demonstrate that our approach does not need to execute the complete set of probes, yet we obtain good detection rates.","","978-1-4799-3778-3","","10.1109/LCN.2014.6925790","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6925790","Bayes inference;Intrusion Detection;Security;Wireless Multihop Networks","Bayes methods;Equations;Intrusion detection;Probes;Spread spectrum communication;Testing;Wireless communication","Bayes methods;indoor communication;security of data;telecommunication standards;wireless mesh networks","AP-NIDS DogoIDS;Bayesian inference;Bayesian model;IEEE 802.11s;WMN;active-probing-based network intrusion detection system;indoor wireless mesh testbed;probe selection algorithm;testbed experimentation;wireless multihop networks","","0","","18","","","8-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So they can 't satisfy the IDS evaluation requirement in highspeed network environment. After analyzing the requirement of IDSs evaluation and the characteristics of network traffic, this paper proposes a differential equation model of active flow rate.

Because two shortages existed in classical association rule mining problem, namely every item set is treated equivalently and a uniform minimum support and minimum confidence is used as weighing standard, many rules and uninteresting rules will be generated that causes low effectiveness of intrusion detection. Based on new association rule mining model proposed by Li etc. (2002) that can solve the two shortages at the same time, a new intrusion detection system was proposed.

Our goal is to develop methodologies by which sites receiving such probes can infer-using purely local observation-information about the probing activity: What scanning strategies does the probing employ? Is this an attack that specifically targets the site, or is the site only incidentally probed as part of a larger, indiscriminant attack? Our analysis draws upon extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including properties, such as trend, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. In addition, we design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) as inferred from the limited local view of a honeynet.

In this paper, we present NetSecu, a platform based on Java and Click Router, which can dynamically enable, disable and configure security elements such as firewall, IPS and AV. Furthermore, a collaborate module is implemented to integrate individual NetSecu platform into a Secure Overlay Network, providing collaborative traffic control against DDoS attack. Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node. A Central Management Site acts as the root node for large scale deployment. The policy is distributed from higher level to lower level NetSecu nodes, while security events are aggregated from lower level to higher level. Performance evaluation shows that our NetSecu system can achieve line rate with and without security function. Finally we deploy the NetSecu platform in multiple sites, where our design is fully demonstrated and tested.","","978-1-61284-312-4","","10.1109/CMC.2011.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5931125","Java;click router;collaborative security;network security;overlay network","Collaboration;Hardware;IP networks;Java;Linux;Probes;Security","Java;computer network security;groupware","DDoS attack;Java;NetSecu;central management site;click router;collaborative network security platform;collaborative traffic control;in-network security;malicious attacks;network security appliances;overlay network security","","4","","10","","","18-20 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Biological information processing systems have various interesting characteristics from an engineering viewpoint. Among them, the immune system plays an important role in maintaining its own system against dynamically changing environments. Based on this fact, we have investigated a new decentralized consensus-making system for the behavior of autonomous mobile robots, inspired by the immune idiotypic network hypothesis in immunology. The developmental encoding scheme is used to translate a given genotype into a complete agent, which then acts in a physically-realistic virtual environment. Evolution is accomplished using a genetic algorithm, in which the genotypes are treated as genetic regula- tory networks. The dynamics of the regulatory network direct the growth of the agent, and lead to the construction of both the morphology and neural control of the agent. We demonstrate that such a model can be used to evolve agents to perform non-trivial tasks, such as directed locomotion and block pushing in a noisy environment.","","0-7803-9487-9","","10.1109/CEC.2006.1688334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688334","","Biological information theory;Encoding;Evolution (biology);Genetic algorithms;Immune system;Information processing;Maintenance engineering;Mobile robots;Morphology;Virtual environment","genetic algorithms;mobile robots","autonomous mobile robots;bio-inspired agent system;decentralized consensus-making system;developmental encoding scheme;dynamic environments;evolutionary agent systems;evolutionary metaphor;genetic algorithm;genetic regulatory networks;genotypes;immune idiotypic network hypothesis;immune system;immunology;neural control","","1","","12","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These unique characteristics makes it ideal for mission critical applications including Personal Area Networking (PAN), military use, Crisis-management applications such as battle field relief and remote explorations. Due to the de-centralized infrastructure, MANET becomes vulnerable to both passive and active attacks. To address such security challenges, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to detect the malicious attackers before they can accomplish any significant damages to the network. The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report. A new key exchange mechanism called Instant Key Generation Mechanism (IKGM) is introduced here to eliminate the predistributed keys requirement. Here the key encryption is done at every node to increase the performances against contemporary approaches.

In this paper, we use a centroid-based technique for network intrusion detection in which the centroid is constructed on the basis of diversity. Diversity of a point is the sum of the distances from a point to all other points in a cluster. The point having minimum diversity is chosen as a centroid. The performance of diversity-based centroid shows significant improvement in the classification of intrusions.

The security industry makes efforts to prevent spreading botnets and compromising an Individual Cyberspace (IC)[1] of users in such way. However, botnets continue existing despite numerous takedowns initiated by antivirus companies, Microsoft, FBI, Europol and others. In this paper we investigate existed methods of traffic detection represented mostly by IDS system and discover new indicators that can be utilized for improving botnet traffic detection. To do this we analyse the most prevalent backdoors communication protocols that stay behind of the popular botnets. As a result, we extracted new data that might be used in detection routines of IDS (Intrusion Detection System).

In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools.

In recent years considerable efforts have been made to design secure and robust routing protocol, and many security schemes have been proposed to tackle these security issues. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of security threats in MANET. In particular, we examine all routing threats that can target the operation of routing protocol, whether they belong to selfish behaviors or malicious attacks, as well as countermeasures against such attacks.

However, these techniques only consider the relationship between system calls (or system audit events). We first refine the definition of maximal patterns given in (Wespi et al., 2000) and provide a pattern extraction algorithm to identify such maximal patterns. We then add one additional dimension to the problem domain by also taking into consideration the overlap relationship between patterns. We argue that an execution path of an application is usually not an arbitrary combination of various patterns; but rather, they overlap each other in some specific order. Such overlap relationship characterizes the normal behavior of the application. Finally, a novel pattern matching module is proposed to detect intrusions based on both intra-pattern and inter-pattern anomalies. We test this idea using the data sets obtained from the University of New Mexico. The experimental results indicate that our scheme detects significantly more anomalies than the scheme presented in (Wespi et al., 2000) while maintaining a very low false alarm rate.","","0-7695-1754-4","","10.1109/ICDM.2002.1184017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184017","","Application software;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Testing;Windows","Unix;data mining;pattern matching;security of data;very large databases","UNIX;data mining;data sets;experimental results;false alarm rate;inter-pattern anomalies;intra-pattern anomalies;intrusion detection;maximal patterns;pattern extraction algorithm;pattern matching module;system calls","","6","","10","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

UnC may be used in parallel with the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem to provide an additional validation step for certificates offered by the PKI model. Leveraging the properties of the Internet infrastructure combined with cooperation from other hosts that act as notaries, UnC attests to the stability of certificates in time and space. By uniting notaries, UnC overwhelms and outnumbers attackers, and it uses this unity to conquer attack plots. Unlike existing proposals aimed to incorporate accountability into the Internet, UnC does not require external certificate hierarchies or certificate authorities to manage digital certificates. UnC can also be integrated in the Secure DNS (DNSSEC) protocols as well as the Secure BGP (S-BGP) protocol to eliminate the need for external key structures while protecting bindings between the entities and their IP addresses, and the integrity of the routing tables between Autonomous Systems. This paper describes the UnC architecture in detail, including the actions of each different kind of participant. It describes how UnC deals with well-known attack models, which are readily available on the Internet.The major contribution of this work is to open up a new door for the research community to exploit the predominance of good nodes over malicious ones in order to enhance the security of the PKI ecosystem and the Internet.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750195","Internet architecture;PKI infrastructure;geographic clusters;notary nodes;security;self-certifying addresses","Artificial neural networks;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Public key;Publishing","Internet;public key cryptography","DNSSEC protocols;Internet unite-and-conquer architecture;PKI model;S-BGP protocol;UnC architecture;public key infrastructure ecosystem;secure BGP protocol;secure DNS protocols;self-certifying mechanism","","0","","41","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Efficient NIDS can be developed by defining a proper rule set for classifying network audit data into normal or attack patterns. Generally, each dataset is characterized by a large set of features, but not all features will be relevant or fully contribute identifying an attack. Since different attacks need different subsets to have better detection accuracy, this paper describes an improved feature selection algorithm to identify most appropriate subset of features for a certain attack. The proposed method is based on MAHALANOBIS Distance feature ranking and an improved exhaustive search to choose a better combination of features. We evaluate the approach on the KDD CUP 1999 datasets using SVM classifier and KNN classifier. The results show that classification is done with high classification rate and low misclassification rate with the reduced feature subsets.","","978-1-4673-6452-2","","10.1109/SNS-PCS.2013.6553837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553837","Feature Selection;KNN;MAHALANOBIS Distance;SVM;classification;intrusion detection","Feature extraction;Industries;Kernel;Optimized production technology;Support vector machines;Virtual private networks","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication security","K-nearest neighbor;KDD CUP 1999 datasets;KNN classifier;MAHALANOBIS distance feature ranking;NIDS;SVM classifier;detection accuracy;exhaustive search;feature selection algorithm;network audit data;network intrusion detection system;network security;support vector machines","","0","","14","","","18-19 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Detecting attacks that exploit application-logic errors through application-level auditing","Jingyu Zhou; Vigna, Giovanni","Dept. of Comput. Sci., California Univ., Santa Barbara, CA, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2004. 20th Annual","20050117","2004","","","168","178","Host security is achieved by securing both the operating system kernel and the privileged applications that run on top of it. Application-level bugs are more frequent than kernel-level bugs, and, therefore, applications are often the means to compromise the security of a system. Detecting these attacks can be difficult, especially in the case of attacks that exploit application-logic errors. These attacks seldom exhibit characterizing patterns as in the case of buffer overflows and format string attacks. In addition, the data used by intrusion detection systems is either too low-level, as in the case of system calls, or incomplete, as in the case of syslog entries. This paper presents a technique to enforce nonbypassable, application-level auditing that does not require the recompilation of legacy systems. The technique is implemented as a kernel-level component, a privileged daemon, and an offline language tool. The technique uses binary rewriting to instrument applications so that meaningful and complete audit information can be extracted. This information is then matched against application-specific signatures to detect attacks that exploit application-logic errors. The technique has been successfully applied to detect attacks against widely-deployed applications, including the Apache Web server and the OpenSSH server.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377227","","Application software;Buffer overflow;Computer bugs;Computer errors;Computer science;Computer security;Data mining;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","Internet;digital signatures;operating system kernels;program debugging;security of data;software maintenance","Apache Web server;OpenSSH server;application-level auditing;application-level bugs;application-logic errors;application-specific signatures;binary rewriting;buffer overflows;host security;intrusion detection systems;legacy systems;offline language tool;operating system kernel;syslog entries;system calls","","1","2","38","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Over the past few years, mobile devices have become the most popular form of communication around the world. However, bundled together with the good and advanced capabilities of the mobile technology, mobile devices can also be used to perform various activities that may be of malicious intent or criminal in nature. This makes mobile devices a valuable source of digital evidence. For this reason, the technological evolution of mobile devices has raised the need to develop standardised investigation process models and procedures within the field of digital forensics. This need further supports the fact that forensic examiners and investigators face challenges when performing data acquisition in a forensically sound manner from mobile devices. This paper, therefore, aims at testing the harmonised digital forensic investigation process through a case study of a mobile forensic investigation. More specifically, an experiment was conducted that aims at testing the performance of the harmonised digital forensic investigation process (HDFIP) as stipulated in the ISO/IEC 27043 draft international standard through the extraction of potential digital evidence from mobile devices.","","978-1-4799-3383-9","","10.1109/ISSA.2014.6950491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950491","Harmonised Digital Forensic Investigation Process (HDFIP);ISO/IEC 27043;mobile device;mobile forensics","ISO standards;Performance evaluation","digital forensics;mobile computing","ISO/IEC 27043 draft international standard;data acquisition;harmonised digital forensic investigation;mobile device;mobile forensics;mobile technology","","0","","32","","","13-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its generic and interoperable structure based on the modern Web technologies, the protocol can be applied to risk assessment and evaluation of a multitude type of systems. The protocol consists of a secure communication architecture associated with each asset a security profile, and software services and agents that communicate over the Internet and other open networks. The secure communication architecture uses a secure exchange protocol incorporating the fast elliptic curve cryptography.

For applications using resource-restricted RFID tags and mobile hand-held readers, however, various risks could threaten their abilities to provide essential services to users. High mobility of the RFID system components and the open nature make an RFID system vulnerable to various attacks. Currently, although some techniques exist that might help improve survivability; there is still no complete proposal on survivability of an RFID system despite its growing popularity and importance in many applications. In this paper, we study survivability issues related to RFID systems and survey existing techniques whose usability and adaptability toward survivability would be beneficial.

MANETs are used in various fields like military, industry and emergency recovery. So it is important to have a firsthand knowledge about MANETs. But there is a certain drawback in MANETs, that it becomes prone to malicious attacks very fast. To avoid such attacks a good intrusion detection and prevention system is needed.

This paper presents an anomaly detection system for web-based applications. The anomaly detection system monitors the attribute value pairs of successful HTTP requests received by webserver applications and automatically creates parameter profiles.

This paper shows that this lack of state information requires an additional metric (The exchange timeout window) for detection of WLAN Denial of Service Probe Flood attacks. Variability in this metric has a significant influence on the ability of a detection system to reliably detect the presence of attacks. A parameter selection method is proposed which is shown to provide reliability and repeatability in attack detection in WLANs.

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.).

Recent studies show that current computer architecture advances and CPU performance improvement has limited impact on network protocol processing performance. Some researchers find that on real SMT processor like Intel Xeon processor with hyper-threadings, the sharing resources (like cache) contention between threads can hurt the performance of network processing applications like servers or IDS. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relation between each phase cache behavior and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads.","","1-4244-0800-8","1-4244-0801-6","10.1109/ICCT.2006.341710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4146365","","Application software;Automata;Computer architecture;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Phase measurement;Protocols;Surface-mount technology;Yarn","multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;processor scheduling","SMT;on cache contention;parallel protocol processing","","1","","10","","","27-30 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The difficulty to define the filtering rules lies where normal and anomaly packets have to be distinguished in incoming packets. The purpose of our research is to explore the early detective method for anomaly accesses based on statistic analysis. In this paper, we defined the chi-square method, and then analyze the all amount of incoming packets to our College focusing on the source IP address using chi-square method. As the results, we were able to extract the following features. Firstly, the number of packets was the more suitable scale of the window in the chi-square method than the time scale. Secondly, the setting of the window size with 500 packets and 2 bins made the detection of the DoS attacks within 10 minutes for DNS packets possible. Finally, we verified that the DoS attacks from the same source IP address was detected using the chi-square method.","","978-1-4244-3569-2","978-0-7695-3575-3","10.1109/CISIS.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066799","Anomaly access;Chi-square method;DNS;DoS attacks","Competitive intelligence;Computer crime;Educational institutions;Filtering;Information security;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Software systems;Testing;Web server","IP networks;authorisation;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP packet;access filtering mechanism;chi-square method;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;statistic analysis","","1","","7","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a mathematical model of the system to study these pitfalls and propose a robust security framework for the smart grid. Our framework adopts the Kalman filter to estimate the variables of a wide range of state processes in the model. The estimates from the Kalman filter and the system readings are then fed into the χ<sup>2</sup>-detector or the proposed Euclidean detector. The χ<sup>2</sup>-detector is a proven effective exploratory method used with the Kalman filter for the measurement of the relationship between dependent variables and a series of predictor variables. The χ<sup>2</sup>-detector can detect system faults/attacks, such as DoS attack, short-term, and long-term random attacks. However, the studies show that the χ<sup>2</sup>-detector is unable to detect the statistically derived false data-injection attack. To overcome this limitation, we prove that the Euclidean detector can effectively detect such a sophisticated injection attack.","2325-5870","","","10.1109/TCNS.2014.2357531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6897944","Cyber physical system;Kalman filter smart grid;false data injection attack;security","Detectors;Kalman filters;Mathematical model;Security;Smart grids","Kalman filters;computer network security;fault diagnosis;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","χ2-detector;DoS attack;Euclidean detector;Kalman filter;communication infrastructure;denial-of-service attack;dependent variables;false data-injection attack;predictor variables;random attack;robust security framework;smart-grid systems security;state processes","","1","","24","","2014-09-12","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"The impacts of internal threats towards Routing Protocol for Low power and lossy network performance","Le, A.; Loo, J.; Yuan Luo; Lasebae, A.","Sch. of Eng. & Inf.

Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the vulnerability and the performance of RPL under these internal security threats.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755045","","Accuracy;Communication system security;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;cryptography;personal area networks;routing protocols;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN standard;DIS attack;Internet;control overhead;cryptography keys;delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;internal security threats;local repair attack;lossy network performance;low power network;neighbour attack;rank attack;routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","0","","7","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This introduces increased potential for innovation in networking from performance-enhanced to energy-efficient designs. In SDN, the application connects with the network via the SDN controller. A specific concern relating to this communication channel is whether an application can be trusted or not. For example, what information about the network state is gathered by the application? Is this information necessary for the application to execute or is it gathered for malicious intent? In this paper we present an approach to secure the northbound interface by introducing a permissions system that ensures that controller operations are available to trusted applications only. Implementation of this permissions system with our Operation Checkpoint adds negligible overhead and illustrates successful defense against unauthorized control function access attempts.","","978-1-4799-6203-7","","10.1109/ICNP.2014.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980437","","Communication networks;Java;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Switches","authorisation;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security","OperationCheckpoint;SDN application control;communication channel;energy-efficient design;performance-enhanced design;permissions system;software defined networking;unauthorized control function access attempts","","0","","15","","","21-24 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently the demand in tight control of the enterprise network to defense the misuse and security issues become more and more urgent. Based on the TCG TNC standard, an application level network access control mechanism is proposed and implemented. With TNC client/server model in hand, a client is designed to enhance TNC client with the function of host flow controller (HFC), and intercepts each application network access request(ANAR) and transfer it to PDP server to authorize the access request. When a sensor (i.e. intrusion detection system) detects any malicious traffic, host flow controller and network flow controller can identify the application that origins this traffic by querying Metadata Access Point (MAP) server and block this application's network access. A prototype system is implemented to demonstrate the design and can be used to defense the anomaly network behaviors. The prototype system demonstrates that the hosts, switches, firewalls and IDS can work together to detect, diagnose and protect enterprise network from the malicious applications attack initiated inside or outside of an enterprise network, quarantine unhealthy hosts and make the enterprise network more reliable and trustworthy.","","978-1-4244-5850-9","","10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541863","Access Control;Application Level Access Control;Network Security;Trusted Network Connect","Access control;Communication system traffic control;Control systems;Hybrid fiber coaxial cables;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Prototypes;Sensor systems and applications;Switches;Traffic control","","","","0","12","16","","","25-27 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This new approach proposes to prevent fraud before initial use of a new card, even users without any real transaction data. This approach shows potential, nevertheless, there are some problems needed solving. A main issue is how to predict accurately with only few data, since it collects quasi-real transaction data via an online questionnaire system and thus respondents are commonly unwilling to spend too much time to reply questionnaires. This study employs both support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to investigate the time-varying fraud problem. The performance of ANN is compared with that from SVM. Results show that SVM and ANN are comparable in training but ANN can have highest training accuracy. However, ANN seems to overfit training data and thus has worse performance of predicting the future data when data number is small","","0-7803-9422-4","","10.1109/ICNNB.2005.1614747","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1614747","","Artificial neural networks;Computer science;Consumer behavior;Credit cards;Engineering management;Logistics;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Technology management;Training data","credit transactions;fraud;neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","artificial neural networks;credit card fraud prevention;online questionnaire system;personalized approach;quasi-real transaction data;support vector machines;time-varying fraud problem","","4","","27","","","13-15 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile Networks have been implemented in order to serve these needs. Unfortunately there are many users who want to use the benefits that technology gives to them for malicious and/or illegal actions. In this paper we present and analyze a hypothetical (but realistic) cyber crime investigation scenario. According to this, a user who has wireless internet access using a mobile phone through a University's network facilities, visits sites with pornographic content. A fact that complicates the analysis of the scenario is that the user employs anti-forensics techniques (e.g. data encryption). In this paper we show how to apply to the investigation of this scenario (as well as similar ones) a number of widely available open source forensics analysis tools overcoming the anti-forensics efforts of malicious users. Our goal is to demonstrate their applicability to cyber-crime forensics and their capability to operate in a complementary, to each other, way so that their deployment sheds light to different aspects of the case at hand.","","978-1-4673-2497-7","","10.1109/ASONAM.2012.165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425641","anti-forensics;computer forensics tools;malicious activities;malware attacks on mobile phones","Computers;Educational institutions;Encryption;Forensics;Malware;Mobile handsets","Internet;computer crime;cryptography;digital forensics;educational institutions;mobile computing;mobile radio;public domain software;smart phones;telecommunication security","antiforensics technique;cyber-crime forensics;data encryption;illegal action;malicious action;malicious user;mobile network;mobile phone user malicious activities;open source forensics analysis tool;open source tool;pornographic content;smart mobile phone;university network facility;wireless internet access","","1","","10","","","26-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
