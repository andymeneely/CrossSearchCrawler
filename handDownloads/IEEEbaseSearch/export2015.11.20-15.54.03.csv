Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.","","978-1-4244-9879-6","978-0-7695-4330-7","10.1109/POLICY.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791","","Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software","fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces","fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy","","1","","23","","","6-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That's why, among others, network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), firewall or other network devices monitor such software to prevent unexpected behaviors. However, their functionalities are limited by design, because they can only handle a configuration of predefined monolithic protocol layerings. In this paper we present Luth, a midpoint inspection device that relies on the composition and parallelization of predefined midpoint inspectors (MI). We present the main functionalities offered by its configuration language and interpreter. Finally, we benchmark a prototype implemented in OCaml.

It is vital for a system administrator or network manager to be able to analyze the vast amount of log data in order to detect suspicious behaviors or patterns, possibly due to malicious users/applications or faulty devices. While an intrusion detection system (IDS) log can provide a large number of warnings, exactly which alarms are true while the others are false, and more importantly what are the underlying causes are still difficult to know. To bridge the gap between network log and anomaly discovery, we design and implement a visualization tool that combines multiple commodity visualizations with minimum learning curve. While each individual view is well understood, the effects of such views in analyzing network anomalies are not well studied. Since each visualization technique has advantages as well as limitations in addressing a particular task, we show that these views, when combined and linked together, may provide an effective and lightweight network anomaly analysis tool. The web-based open platform may simplify network administration as well as promote collaborative analysis among researchers.","","","","10.1109/PacificVis.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787176","Network Anomaly Visualization","Data visualization;Image color analysis;Joining processes;Market research;Security;Servers;Visualization","Internet;computer network management;computer network security;data analysis;data visualisation","IDS log;Web-based open platform;anomaly detection;collaborative analysis;faulty devices;interactive visualization;intrusion detection system log;large-scale networks;log data analysis;malicious applications;malicious users;minimum learning curve;multiple commodity visualizations;network anomaly analysis tool;network management;suspicious behavior detection;suspicious pattern detection","","1","","14","","","4-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experimental results show that our IDPS can distinguish normal network activities from main attack types (Probe and Denial of Service) with high accuracy of detection rate in a few seconds and automatically prevent the victim's computer network from the attacks.

"Unveiling flat traffic on the Internet: An SSH attack case study","Jonker, M.; Hofstede, R.; Sperotto, A.; Pras, A.","Centre for Telematics & Inf. Technol. (CTIT), Univ. of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands","Integrated Network Management (IM), 2015 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on","20150702","2015","","","270","278","Many types of brute-force attacks are known to exhibit a characteristic `flat' behavior at the network-level, meaning that connections belonging to an attack feature a similar number of packets and bytes, and duration. Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the physical layer, they can be protected by lock-and-key, and at the data link, they can be protected within VLANS (virtual LANs). With the network and transport layers, networks can be secured by firewalls, which monitor source and destination network addresses, and source and destination ports, respectively. At the session level, user names and passwords are be used. Unfortunately, all these methods can be prone to methods which can overcome the protection used. This paper expands the research previously undertaken on a misuse system based on the intelligent agent software technology. The system monitors user actions in real-time and take appropriate actions if necessary. Along with this our system uses a short-term prediction to predict the user behaviour and advises the system administrator accordingly, before the actual actions take place.

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

Based on the domain knowledge of network data (network packets) the SOM/FCM combination presents quantitative and qualitative matching correspondences which in turn reduce the number of suspicious neurons i.e. reduce the number of false alerts.

This fundamental premise, which we term w<sup>3</sup>, provides a vehicle for comparing between seemingly disparate events. We propose a concise and scalable representation of these three attributes, that leads to a flexible visualization tool that is also clear and intuitive to use. Within our system, alerts can be grouped and viewed hierarchically with respect to both their type, i.e., the what, and to their where attributes. Further understanding is gained by displaying the temporal distribution of alerts to reveal complex attack trends. Finally, we propose a set of visual metaphor extensions that augment the proposed paradigm and enhance users' situational awareness. These metaphors direct the attention of users to many-to-one correlations within the current display helping them detect abnormal network activity.","","0-7803-9290-6","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495939","","Complex networks;Data visualization;Decision making;Displays;Humans;Intrusion detection;Moon;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicles","computer networks;data visualisation;security of data","abnormal network activity detection;alert temporal distribution;attack trend;attribute representation;data visualization;disparate logs;many-to-one correlation;network alert visual correlation;network intrusion detection;user situational awareness;visual metaphor","","11","","19","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such techniques are not constructed based on the understanding of EEG and brain functions, neither inspired by the understanding of emotional dynamics. Hence, the features are difficult to be interpreted and yield low classification performance. In this study, a new feature extraction technique using Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is proposed. The features are extracted from the weights of data-driven self-organizing feature map that are adjusted during training to optimize the error obtained from the desired output and the calculated output. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is then employed to perform classification on fear, happiness, sadness and calm emotions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of classifying emotions from EEG signals captured on 12 children aged between 4 to 6 years old ranging from 84.18% to 89.29%. In addition, classification performance for features derived from other techniques such as Power Spectrum Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are also presented as a standard benchmark for comparison purpose. It is observed that the proposed approach is able to yield accuracy of 33.77% to 55% as compared to the respective comparison features. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach has potential for comparative emotion recognition accuracy when coupled with MLP.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836608","CMAC;EEG;emotion classification;feature extraction;latent features","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Training","cerebellar model arithmetic computers;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;feature extraction;multilayer perceptrons;self-organising feature maps;signal classification","CMAC;EEG signals;KDE;MFCC;MLP classifier;Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;PSD;calm emotion;cerebellar model articulation controller;classification performance;computational cerebellar model;data-driven self-organizing feature map;emotion classification;emotion recognition accuracy;fear emotion;feature extraction;happiness emotion;kernel density estimation;multilayer perceptron classifier;power spectrum density;sadness emotion","","0","","28","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The standard approach for implementing a wireless sniffer is to setup a device in the so-called Promiscuous mode. In this mode, devices are able to acquire all traffic that passes through them, independently from its destination. On a wireless network, this means that it is possible to monitor all the activities inside the device's cover range. Unfortunately, the Promiscuous mode limits the use of the device by prohibiting the association with wireless networks, or in general, sending data. This limitation restricts uses of sniffers on specific scenarios. This paper shows how to remove such limitation by presenting our Laurin Project. Laurin is a wireless sniffer that provides sniffer's capabilities without limiting the device's use. This solution opens the doors to the development of new desktop-oriented applications that take advantage of network monitoring capabilities.","2156-9711","978-1-4244-9230-5","978-1-4244-9228-2","10.1109/WD.2010.5657729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657729","IEEE 802.11;Promiscuous mode;RFMON;mac80211;sniffer","Ad hoc networks;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","monitoring;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless networks;IEEE 802.11 wireless sniffers;MAC level;Promiscuous mode;desktop-oriented applications;information acquisition;network traffic monitoring;non-invasive node detection","","0","","23","","","20-22 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","265","271","A common method of identifying attacks with anomaly network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is to detect significant deviations in network traffic compared to normal conditions. Such changes may include unexpected high traffic volume, caused by, for example, a denial of service (DoS) attack. However, recent research on traffic engineering has demonstrated that modern data network traffic exhibits high burstiness at a wide range of observation window sizes, i.e., self-similarity (V. Paxon et al., 1995, W.E. Leland et al., 1994), The self-similar traffic may challenge the traditional anomaly NIDS by making it unable to distinguish attacks from traffic bursts. In this paper, we investigate the employment of low pass filters in the anomaly NIDS to smooth the burstiness in network traffic measurements and thus reduce the false alarms. We studied the use of the MWA filter and the Savitzky-Golay filter. By analyzing the resulting network traffic measurements, we found out that the MWA filter significantly changed, while the Savitzky-Golay filter only moderately altered, the statistical properties of the network traffic measurements. To investigate the effectiveness of a low pass filter on anomaly NIDS, we applied the low pass filter to our anomaly NIDS, namely, the MIB anomaly intrusion detection (MAID) system. By employing these filters in MAID, we observed that the Savitzky-Golay filter outperforms the MWA filter. The results of the performance evaluation process also demonstrated that the low pass filter can significantly enhance the detection capacity of MAID, by reducing its false alarm rate.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437826","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437826","","Area measurement;Computer crime;Employment;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters;Read only memory;Telecommunication traffic;Time measurement;Volume measurement","computer networks;low-pass filters;performance evaluation;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","MWA filter;Savitzky-Golay filter;anomaly network intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;low pass filters;management information base;network traffic;self-similar traffic;traffic engineering","","0","","8","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A particularly severe security attack, called the wormhole attack, has been introduced in the context of ad-hoc networks. During the attack, a malicious node captures packets from one location in the network, and tunnels them to another malicious node at a distant point, which replays them locally. In this paper we survey and classify the solutions that have been proposed in the literature for this attack and propose a decentralized scheme for intrusion detection based on the theory of diffusion of innovations.

This paper discusses the issues involving large-scale log processing that helps analyze log records. In this paper we propose to analyze intersections of log files that come from different applications and firewalls installed on one computer, and intersections resulting from log files coming from different computers.

A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node. In this research we have simulated different types of attacks and also provided pseudo code for different attacks like route invasion, eavesdrop, sinkhole. Then the performance of these attacks against the proposed algorithm has been calculated and result is displayed.","","978-0-9893-1933-1","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918258","Adhoc networks;Denial of service;Intrusion;Multitier;Trust;commitment","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","DSR algorithm;application layer data;application tier;data transfer;intrusion detection systems;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;muiltier intrusion detection system;routing policy;routing tier;security attack;trust tier;trusted connection;trusted multitier method","","0","","15","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As attacks on computer systems are becoming increasingly numerous and sophisticated, there is a growing need for intrusion detection and response systems to dynamically adapt to better detect and respond to attacks. The Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System (AHA! IDS) provides detection adaptation by adjusting the amount of system resources devoted to the task of detecting intrusive activities. This is accomplished by dynamically invoking new combinations of lower level detection agents in response to changing circumstances and by adjusting the confidence associated with these lower-level agents. The Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System (AAIRS) provides response adaptation by weighting those responses that have been successful in the past over those techniques that have not been as successful. As a result, the more successful responses are used more often than the less successful techniques. It also adapts responses based on the system's belief that intrusion detection reports are valid.

SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on","20070820","2007","","","678","684","While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software- defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices. We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, (1) impacts system performance, (2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, (3) addresses ""bad mouthing"" and (4) resists collusion.","","1-4244-1268-4","1-4244-1268-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292881","","Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Resists;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML","XML;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;XML based policy engine;bad mouthing;centralized trust authority;misbehaving nodes;physical layer information;reputation vector;reputation-enabled intrusion detection system;software programmable devices;wireless networks","","3","","22","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","15","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This improved Apriori algorithm is considered to make the data mining process faster. Reactive policies are adopted for the detected intrusions. These policies are created based on the severity of an intrusion and an appropriate response is generated for the users who performed intrusive activity. This approach enhances the database security by generating more selective and more sensitive rules, and by providing faster decision, faster performance.","","978-1-4673-2981-1","","10.1109/CICN.2012.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375208","Anomaly detection;Apriori Algorithm;Database;Intrusion Detection System;Misuse detection","Association rules;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;Monitoring;Training","authorisation;data mining;database management systems;transaction processing","apriori algorithm;association analysis;association rule mining;data mining process;database security;hybrid reactive database intrusion detection system;information system infrastructure;intrusion severity;intrusive activity;reactive policies;selective rules;sensitive information;sensitive rules;unauthorized transaction;user activity parameters;user behaviour","","0","","19","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model abstracts the alert topic and represents it as the local alert case by analyzing the alert of campus network culture in depth. The model not only discovers new alert topic of local network domain, but also cooperatively schedules the information of alert case knowledge base (ACKB) between different alert monitor nodes. CATDM discovers new alert topic of each monitor node and optimizes the local ACKB periodically. Through cooperatively scheduling the information of ACKB between different alert monitor nodes, the model enables some alert monitor nodes to obtain the ability of detecting new alert topic and strengthens the detection ability of burst alert topic. To validate the performance of CATDM, we present two comparison experiments on the data corpus about Â¿campus network cultureÂ¿. The experiment results validate the feasibility and practicality of CATDM, and demonstrate that CATDM can effectively improve the detecting ability of burst alert topics of local network domain in distributed environment.","","978-0-7695-3929-4","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380353","alert case knowledge base;alert topic detection;alert topic discovery;cooperative scheduling","Abstracts;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Computer science;Data mining;Distributed computing;Event detection;Internet;Monitoring;Web sites","distributed processing;knowledge based systems;scheduling;security of data","alert case knowledge base;campus network culture;cooperative alert topic detection model;cooperative scheduling;distributed environment;local network domain;topic detection and tracking technologies","","5","","17","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The designed layout is verified and analyzed by micromagnetic simulations.

IEEE","20100304","2009","","","1","6","Local monitoring has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for mitigating security attacks in multi-hop ad-hoc networks. In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality. We show through analysis and simulation that the basic local monitoring (BLM) fails to efficiently mitigate stealthy power control attacks while MPC successfully mitigates them.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425559","","Communication system traffic control;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power control;Protocols;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;power control;protocols;security of data;wireless channels","MPC;basic local monitoring;malicious behavior;mitigating security attacks;mitigating stealthy power control attacks;multihop ad-hoc networks;partial neighborhood communication;protocol;stealthy packet dropping;wireless ad hoc networks","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider the scenario where a well informed intruder divides his attack over multiple packets in order to increase his chances of successfully intruding a target domain. Each fragment of the attack is transmitted through a different path using multi-path routing, where each path is selected with a different probability. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work done for the case where the attack is split over multiple packets using game theory.

Cloud computing presents the abstract layer to user for storing their confidential data hiding their architectural details. Due to this whenever the malicious activity happens in cloud, it becomes very difficult to trace.

In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network.","","0-7803-9477-1","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532065","","Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Data analysis;Data security;Data visualization;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","information visualization;intrusion detection analysis;packet-level analysis;time-based network traffic visualizer;visual network traffic analysis","","11","","27","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

System architecture is composed by two interconnected layers of intelligent agents. The first layer is concerned by intrusion detection. On each host of a distributed computers system, an intelligent agent using Bayesian network is charged by detecting intrusion eventuality. The second layer is based upon one intelligent agent which is charged by intrusion forecasting task based on Bayesian network prediction. Agents of these two layers communicate using messages. When new intrusion is detected on the first layer, the agent responsible of this host informs the forecasting agent placed in the second layer. This latter computes conditional probabilities of intrusion appearance on each host of the distributed system, and informs the administrator of the concerned host about possible ultimate intrusion","","0-7803-9521-2","","10.1109/ICTTA.2006.1684901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1684901","","Authorization;Bayesian methods;Centralized control;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Multiagent systems;Protection","belief networks;distributed processing;multi-agent systems;security of data","Bayesian network prediction;distributed computer system;distributed intrusion detection system;forecasting agent;forecasting multiagent system;intelligent agent;intrusion eventuality detection;intrusion forecasting task;system architecture","","3","","26","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a given server or network is under a DoS condition, its capability to distinguish good from bogus requests gets severely reduced and the service is refused to some, if not all, legitimate users. In such situation, the most obvious fact for the victim is the DoS condition itself and nothing else. Because of that, the options of the victim server or network are confined to traffic filtering/shaping or, ultimately, to forensic mechanisms. In this paper, a security mechanism based on simple notifications to a special port is proposed, and explained in detail by enumerating different application cases. The mechanism is going to prove itself especially useful for attenuating the impact of reflected DoS attacks and for the detection of malicious software on remote zombie machines, unconsciously contributing to non spoofed distributed attacks.","","978-0-7695-3189-2","978-0-7695-3189-2","10.1109/ICIMP.2008.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561328","Denial-of-Service;Distributed Denial-of-Service;DoS;Mitigation;Operating System;Security Mechanism;Zombie Identification;port","Application software;Computer crime;Computer networks;Filtering;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protocols;Reflection;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software","bogus requests;denial of service attacks;fake messages;forensic mechanisms;malicious software detection;nonspoofed distributed attacks;security mechanism;server resources;traffic filtering;victim server;zombie identification port","","0","","15","","","June 29 2008-July 5 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaboration among IDSs allows users to benefit from the collective knowledge and information from their collaborators and achieve more accurate intrusion detection. However, most existing collaborative intrusion detection networks rely on the exchange of intrusion data which raises privacy concerns. To overcome this problem, we propose SMURFEN: a Rule Sharing intrusion detection network, which provides a platform for IDS users to effectively share their customized detection knowledge in an IDS community. An automatic rule propagation mechanism is proposed based on a decentralized two-level optimization problem formulation. We evaluate our rule sharing system through simulations and compare our results to existing knowledge sharing methods such as random gossiping and fixed neighbors sharing schemes.","","978-1-4577-1588-4","978-3-901882-44-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104003","","Collaboration;Computers;Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Receivers;Software","Internet;computer network security;groupware;telecommunication traffic","IDS community;SMURFEN;automatic rule propagation mechanism;computer activities;decentralized two-level optimization problem formulation;knowledge sharing methods;neighbors sharing schemes;network traffic monitoring;random gossiping;rule sharing collaborative intrusion detection system;system framework","","1","","21","","","24-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since people and organizations now rely on distributed systems in accessing and processing critical services and mission, the availability of information and continuity of services are becoming more important. Therefore the importance of implementing systems that continue to function in the presence of security breaches cannot be overemphasized. One of the solutions to provide the availability and continuity of information system applications is introducing an intrusion tolerance system. Security mechanism and adaptation mechanism can ensure intrusion tolerance by protecting the application from accidental or malicious changes to the system and by adapting the application to the changing conditions. In this paper we propose an intrusion tolerance model that improves the developmental structure while assuring security level.

The attacker, in fact, has his own unique interests for the resources he gains access to by masquerading a legitimate user. For this reason, to learn the user specific interests will help in identifying the masqueraders. This is a new attempt. Based on the outstanding characteristics of cloud model on processing transformation between a qualitative concept and a set of quantitative numerical values, we apply cloud model to analyzing the correlation between user behaviors and user interests.

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Stealthy tracing attackers research light trace (STARLlTE) is a customization and significant extension to BBN's source path isolation engine (SPlE.) The goal of STARLlTE was to construct a prototype to integrate single packet traceback with stepping stone detection. The resulting prototype traces a packet to an ingress router, and then discovers if the flow of that packet is related to a flow in another connection. A successful correlation can then be continued until an ultimate source is located","0742-1303","0-7695-2421-4","","10.1109/LCN.2005.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1550963","","Computer networks;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Search engines","IP networks;telecommunication security","ingress router;multi-stage network attack traceback;packet traceback techniques;source path isolation engine;stealthy tracing attackers research light trace","","5","2","18","","","17-17 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For that, we designed a security mobile agent system for distributed intrusion detection and implemented a prototype. In this paper, we firstly analyze the shortcomings of current IDSs and discuss the state of the art for applying MA technology in IDS. Then we present our MA-IDS architecture and detail methods of local intrusion detection and distributed intrusion detection.

In this paper, we analyze the possibility of using data stream mining for enhancing the security of AMI through an intrusion detection system (IDS), which is a second line of defense after the primary security methods of encryption, authentication, authorization, etc. We propose a realistic and reliable IDS architecture for the whole AMI system, which consists of individual IDSs for three different levels of AMI's components: smart meter, data concentrator, and AMI headend. We also explore the performances of various existing state-of-the-art data stream mining algorithms on a publicly available IDS data set, namely, the KDD Cup 1999 data set. Then, we conduct a feasibility analysis of using these existing data stream mining algorithms, which exhibit varying levels of accuracies, memory requirements, and running times, for the distinct IDSs at AMI's three different components. Our analysis identifies different candidate algorithms for the different AMI components' IDSs, respectively.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2294120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6720175","Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI);data stream mining;intrusion detection system (IDS);smart grid (SG)","Computer architecture;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Smart grids","authorisation;cryptography;data mining;smart meters;smart power grids","KDD Cup 1999 data set;advanced metering infrastructure;authentication;authorization;data concentrator;data stream mining;encryption;intrusion detection system;primary security;security enhancement;smart grid;smart meter","","0","","38","","2014-01-23","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

International Conference on","20091002","2006","","","1","6","As online services increasingly play vital roles in modern society, the possibilities and opportunities offered are limitless, unfortunately, so too are the risks and chances of malicious intrusions. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has been widely used as an important component in protecting online service towards Web attacks and evasions. Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called zero administrative server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a virtual machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion. In this paper, we demonstrate ZAS by exposing it to several attacking tools as well as to show the effects it takes on the network performance in terms of TCP throughput and application-to-application round trip time.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276470","Checksum;Intrusion Detection System;Virtual Machine;WWW Server","File servers;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection;Testing;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server;World Wide Web","Web services;security of data;virtual machines","VM based autonomous Web server;Web attacks;intrusion detection systems;malicious attacks;network performance testing;online services;virtual machine;zero administrative server","","0","","16","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The capacity of such networks remains a fundamental obstacle toward the adaptation of sensor network systems for advanced applications that require higher data rates and throughput. In this paper, we explore potential benefits of integrating directional antennas into wireless sensor networks. While the usage of directional antennas has been investigated in the past for ad hoc networks, their usage in sensor networks bring both opportunities as well as challenges. In this paper, Sectored-Antenna Medium Access Control (SAMAC), an integrated cross-layer protocol that provides the communication mechanisms for sensor network to fully utilize sectored antennas, is introduced. Simulation studies show that SAMAC delivers high energy efficiency and predictable delay performance with graceful degradation in performance with increased load.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5439005","CSMA/CA.;Sensor networks;TDMA;cross-layer protocols;directional antennas;scheduling;sectored antennas","","access protocols;directive antennas;wireless sensor networks","SAMAC;directional antennas;integrated cross-layer communication protocol;sectored-antenna medium access control;wireless sensor network system","","7","","24","","2010-03-25","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The actions of sensor nodes are either pre-scheduled inside chips or triggered to respond outside events in the predefined way. This relatively predictable working flow make it easy to build accurate node profiles and detect any violation of normal profiles. In this paper, traffic patterns observed are used to model node behavior in wireless sensor networks. Firstly, selected traffic related features are used to translate observed packets into different events. Following this, unique patterns based on the arriving order of different packet events are extracted to form the normal profile for each sensor node during the profile learning stage. Finally, real time anomaly detection can be achieved based on the profile matching.","","978-0-7695-2847-2","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221100","","Humans;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Runtime;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","anomaly node behavior detection;profile matching;traffic patterns;wireless sensor networks","","1","","14","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
