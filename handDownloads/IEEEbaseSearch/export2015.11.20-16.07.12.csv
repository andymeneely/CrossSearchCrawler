The sensors are assumed to continually provide OOTDS with events reflecting changes in the environment. OOTDS performs event analysis using a network of asynchronous blocks with increasing complexity. Front blocks convert sensor specific events to a unified form. A suggestion block provides hints for threat assessment based on a set of rules. The core threat detection block estimates probabilities of the suggested threats using Multi-Entities Bayesian Networks (MEBN) logic inference based on facts resulting from observed events and knowledge stored in an environment specific threat detection ontology (TDO). Threats with sufficiently high probability levels result in notifications sent to concerned users.The paper defines main OOTDS goals and presents its architecture followed by a short introduction to MEBN logic and an exemplary OOTDS application with a usage scenario.","","978-0-7695-3674-3","","10.1109/DepCoS-RELCOMEX.2009.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5261021","Bayesian networks;MEBN logic;domain monitoring;inference;threat detection","Bayesian methods;Event detection;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Logic;Monitoring;Ontologies;Paper technology;Plasma materials processing;Sensor systems","belief networks;inference mechanisms;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data","asynchronous blocks;core threat detection block;environment monitoring;event analysis;high probability level;logic inference;multientities Bayesian networks;ontology oriented threat detection system;sensors;suggestion block;threat assessment;threat detection ontology","","1","","12","","","June 30 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in this work we consider intrusion detection systems that monitor behavior of sensor nodes and detect the malicious ones among them. Our work is exploratory in that we propose metrics for evaluation of these systems. There are evaluation metrics for intrusion detection systems for conventional wired and wireless networks. However, to our best knowledge there is no work that proposes evaluation metrics for intrusion detection systems for wireless sensor networks. We divide the proposed metrics into two groups. In the first group there are metrics for detection techniques without a response mechanism. In the second group there are metrics for detection techniques together with a response mechanism. The proposed metrics will help an administrator of a network to choose the best intrusion detection system from a set of systems or to optimize a configuration of a certain intrusion detection system for a given network with a particular topology, sensor nodes capabilities and anticipated types of attack.","","978-1-4244-6049-6","","10.1109/EC2ND.2009.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5494336","evaluation metrics;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor network","Base stations;Computer networks;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Jamming;Monitoring;Protection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","cryptographic techniques;intrusion detection system;sensor nodes capabilities;wireless sensor networks","","1","","15","","","9-10 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These benefits are incentives for users to cheat about their current location, in order to get unauthorized access to resources and services provided by location-sensitive applications. To deal with this issue, we propose CREPUSCOLO, a collusion resistant and privacy preserving location verification system. In CREPUSCOLO, we use “location-proofs” collected from co-located mobile devices, which can be endorsed by a “token” acquired from a trusted Token Provider. In fact, location-proofs endorsed by tokens provide the resiliency against collusion attacks, because this combination can prove that a certain mobile device was at a certain location at a specific time. CREPUSCOLO also protects the source location privacy by enforcing the usage of periodically changing pseudonyms. Extensive simulations show that CREPUSCOLO is effective in detecting collusion attacks even under very conservative hypothesis. For instance, with just 11 Token Providers spread over a 121 km<sup>2</sup> area characterized by a very low density of cooperating devices, 90% of collusion attacks are detected.","","","","10.1109/CRiSIS.2013.6766357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766357","","Authorization;Geology;Jamming;Protocols","authorisation;data privacy;formal verification;mobile computing","CREPUSCOLO;collusion attacks;collusion resistant privacy preserving location verification system;location based access control;location based social networks;location sensitive applications;mobile device;source location privacy;trusted token provider;unauthorized access","","0","","15","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We demonstrate that existing ad hoc routing protocols are vulnerable to passive attacks: in the feasible adversary model, (a) the location and motion patterns of mobile nodes can be traced, while (b) proactive and reactive/on-demand ad hoc routes across multiple mobile nodes can be visualized by the adversary.

Vulnerability management tools require patterns to find or monitor vulnerabilities. Such patterns have to be derived from vulnerability types. Existing analysis methods such as attack trees and FMEA result in such types, yet require much experience and provide little guidance during the analysis. Our main contribution is ATLIST, a new vulnerability analysis method with improved transferability. Especially in service-oriented architectures, which employ a mix of established web technologies and SOA-specific standards, previously observed vulnerability types and variations thereof can be found. Therefore, we focus on the detection of known vulnerability types by leveraging previous vulnerability research. A further contribution in this respect is the, to the best of our knowledge, most comprehensive compilation of vulnerability information sources to date. We present the method to search for vulnerability types in SOA-based business processes and services. Also, we show how patterns can be derived from these types, so that tools can be employed.

This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices, We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance, 2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses ""bad mouthing"" and 4) resists collusion.","","1-4244-1315-X","1-4244-1316-8","10.1109/SDRN.2007.4348973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4348973","","Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Standards development;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML","","","","0","","22","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems detect intrusions and prevent attackers from succeeding in their intrusion attempts. They usually rely on pattern matching and therefore, work efficiently on known-attacks. However, they do not work efficiently on unknown-attacks such as zero-day attacks and targeted attacks. This means, we should assume that our machines can be corrupted anytime. Therefore, we should consider what we can do under this assumption for a next generation security framework. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection methodology using the support of other machines. In our proposal, when an attacker tries to attack other machines from a corrupted machine that the attacker has already intruded, other machines notify it to the administrator of the corrupted machine. Then, the attacker may lose the corrupted machine. Therefore, the attacker restrains itself from imprudently attacking other machines.

These are mainly used for the command & control of spacecraft and the exploitation and dissemination of space-based services to end users. A new ESA activity, the European Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Initiative, requires a novel generation of mission data systems to be developed. These systems are based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and capable of supporting a large system-of-systems environment. At the same time, information security is an area of growing concern in the space business and among space agencies. Especially in the area of SOA-based environments, where interconnectivity of components is a core principle, an efficient and robust security concept needs to be put in place to ensure secure mission operations. In this paper, we describe an application security framework for SOA-based mission data systems. This framework increases significantly the robustness and security of web services and web applications through use of a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) and provision of tools & templates for SSA mission data system developers. We are confident that the application security framework will drastically improve the security and robustness of SOA-based mission data systems that will be used in the European SSA Initiative and other ESA projects, while at the same time keeping the related additional effort minimal.","","978-1-4577-0712-4","978-1-4577-0713-1","10.1109/SMC-IT.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007775","Information Security;Secure Software Development Lifecycle;Service-Oriented Architectures;Software Engineering;System-of-Systems","Computer architecture;Data systems;Europe;Programming;Risk management;Security;Service oriented architecture","Web services;command and control systems;safety-critical software;security of data;service-oriented architecture;space vehicles","European space situational awareness;SOA-based mission data systems;Web applications;Web services;application security framework;command & control;component interconnectivity;information security;secure software development lifecycle;service-oriented architecture;space agencies;space-based services;spacecraft;system-of-systems","","3","","12","","","2-4 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various approaches to intrusion detection are currently being used, but they are relatively ineffective. Recently applying artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining techniques to IDS are increasing. Artificial intelligence plays a driving role in security services. This paper proposes an Immune based adaptive intrusion detection system model (IAIDSM). Analyzing the training data obtaining from Internet, the self behavior set and nonself behavior set can be obtained by the partitional clustering algorithm, then it extracts Self and nonself pattern sets from these two behavior sets by association rules and sequential patterns mining. The self and nonself sets can update automatically and constantly online.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present an extension of the clustering approach using a genetic algorithm based upon a new kind of fitness heuristic. This heuristic ""intelligently"" guides the selection based upon feedback concerning the overlap among the clusters.

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes. In this paper, rapid malcode signatures are automatically generated based on their spreading behavior, specially aimed at automatically extracting and deploying signatures on the packet level, without the need for reassembly that could be used by signature-based firewalls network intrusion detection system.

Various techniques for passive testing on Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) exist such as by invariants and by interval determination, which are not very costy in terms of complexity but that also dont detect every errors. To improve the fault detection capabilities a backward checking method was proposed. It analyzes in a backward fashion the input/output trace from passive testing and its past. It effectively checks both the control and data portion of a protocol system and is able to detect every errors, but with a higher complexity. The purpose of the present paper is then to propose possible parallel algorithms and architectures to improve the backward passive testing approach by narrowing down its maximal time complexity and transforming it into the first real-time exhaustive passive testing approach.

While the commonly used kernel functions of SVM such as RBF kernel and Gauss kernel are non-orthogonal, whose detection capacity and speed are unsatisfactory for complex non-linear system in IDS. LS-SVM is an evolution of classical SVM. It looks for the solution by solving linear equations instead of a convex quadratic programming in classical SVM.

From a database point of view, such a connection is always established by the same user (i.e. the web application) and specific data on the end user is not available. As a consequence, users' specific transactions cannot be audited and fine-grained access control cannot be enforced at the database level. In this paper we propose a method and a system which provide the ability to track the end users in web databases. The new method can be applied to legacy web applications without requiring any changes in their existing infrastructure.

However, wireless communication faces several security threats. Consequently, several security efforts have been exerted to combat the wireless attacks, but unfortunately complete attack prevention is not realistically attainable. Thus, the emphasis on detecting intrusions through a second line of defense, in the form of Intrusion Detection System (IDS), is increasing. Selecting an effective and appropriate IDS system should take its functionality and performance evaluation into account. Unbiased and reliable evaluation necessarily depends on a well-engineered evaluation methodology. Dealing with this challenge, this paper proposed a holistic methodology for IDSs evaluation in wireless networks. Our methodology includes all necessary and sufficient tasks for IDSs evaluation.

Although it offers tremendous opportunities, there are some major challenges, such as security, that must be solved for efficient usage. Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex).","","978-1-4799-0194-4","","10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705192","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Cloud computing;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;data privacy;security of data;trusted computing","AdjointVM approach;capex;capital expenditure;circular chain intrusion detection;cloud computing;confidentiality;data centers;information security;protection architecture defenselessness;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees","","1","","17","","","19-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A BV is normally associated with a default interest group (e.g., power grid operator). When the BV accesses its default charging or communication point, it works in the home mode. The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy. We perform comprehensive analysis on the proposed scheme, including attack analysis, security analysis, and performance analysis. It is shown that AP3A can resist major attacks for security protection and privacy preservation, and can be an efficient authentication approach for V2G networks.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2212730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6336849","Authentication;privacy;security;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Authentication;Batteries;Electric vehicles;Privacy;Protocols;Vehicles","battery powered vehicles;power system protection;power system security;smart power grids","AP3A;V2G network;aggregated pseudostatus variation;aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication;attack analysis;battery vehicle charging status;communication resource;multiple BV power status;performance analysis;secure identification;security protection analysis;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid network","","7","","31","","2012-10-22","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Network and information security is of increasing concern as intruders utilize more advanced technologies, and attacks are occurring much more frequently. A simple intrusion can cause an enterprise financial disaster, a threat to national safety, or loss of human life. Network-based and computer-based intrusion detection systems (IDS's) started appearing some twenty years ago. Now, there are various synchronous and asynchronous tools for external and internal network and host intrusion detection and mitigation using models ranging from signature scanning and pattern matching, to statistical anomaly detection. Although modern tools are much more advanced, they still have many limitations, shortcomings, and open issues. Most tend to be focused on matching known patterns as opposed to discovery of new anomalies through, for example, inductive reasoning about potential anomaly signals.

The proposed concept is based on a distributed network intrusion detection system (D-NIDS) integrated as a pump-in-the-stack process, based on a simplified open source network stack (light weight IP-lwIP). The small process-footprint (multi or single threaded) makes this solution suitable for all platforms and operating systems. Thus, embedded systems as well as high performance PCs or workstations may run this service without operating expense. The proposed solution differs from other solutions by a simple installation process-since no interactions are existing between the host- and the NIDS-stack- and the ability to run applications on top of the IDS (e.g. alluring-systems or sandbox systems). But the main idea is to take advantage of a mechanism known as ""state-transition intrusion detection"" and the integration of this mechanism into the network stack. The usage of state-transition based signatures can reduce large database entries and allows the reuse of already existing network stacks. Due to small database entries, this approach is highly scalable and can be a proper solution for small devices, PDAs, and embedded systems.","","953-184-052-0","","10.1109/CONTEL.2003.176969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215879","","Communications technology;Databases;Embedded system;Information processing;Intrusion detection;Lakes;Operating systems;Personal communication networks;Personal digital assistants;Workstations","IP networks;embedded systems;network operating systems;safety systems","IP networks;PDA;database entries;embedded systems;high performance PC;installation process;network segment;open source network stack;operating systems;pump-in-the-stack process;stack-based distributed network intrusion detection system;state-transition driven signatures","","1","","","","","11-13 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards. Our experimental evaluation shows that Scap can capture all streams for traffic rates two times higher than other stream reassembly libraries. Finally, we present the implementation and performance evaluation of four popular network traffic monitoring applications built on top of Scap.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901242","Traffic monitoring;overload control;packet capture;packet filtering;performance;stream reassembly","Instruction sets;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Packet loss;Protocols","parallel processing;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Scap;Stream capture library;TCP segmentation;TCP stream reassembly;connection-oriented analysis;data movement operations;high-speed network;intrusion detection;multicore architectures;network monitoring;parallel processing;stream-oriented network traffic capture;stream-oriented traffic processing;traffic classification","","0","","54","","2014-09-17","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues: (1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies.","","","","10.1109/WETICE.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927063","Indistinguability;Nonmalleability;Secure Scheduling;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Context;Generators;Scheduling;Security;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;quality of service;scheduling;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","communication costs nodes;network lifetime;protocols;quality of service;resource constraints;resource preservation requirement;secure communication infrastructure;secure nodes scheduling algorithm;security framework;wireless sensor networks","","0","","14","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778","Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management","finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data","Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton","","0","","25","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. Thus, real-world constraints such as network congestion, limited node energy levels, or non-cooperation of nodes might severely impact the performance and the robustness of existing planar graph routing variants. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We investigate basic schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network, and derive algorithms for routing and forwarding along these curves. We analytically prove that our scheme is loop free and allows for guaranteed delivery in arbitrary planar connected graphs. We implement curve-based routing and show its feasibility by means of a simulation study. As a proof-of-concept scenario, we investigate the case of non-cooperating nodes. Our results show that curve-based routing is able to sustain the delivery of packets where traditional schemes fail.","","978-1-4673-1238-7","978-1-4673-1237-0","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263689","Algorithms;delivery guarantees;localized routing;network protocols;wireless multihop networks","Clocks;Joining processes;Routing;Spread spectrum communication;Trajectory;Wireless networks","radio networks;telecommunication network routing","curve-based planar graph routing;face routing extension;guaranteed delivery;limited node energy levels;localized geographic routing schemes;multihop wireless networks;network congestion;noncooperating nodes;proof-of-concept scenario;real-world constraints","","2","","17","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper contributes with the proposal of an on-the-fly statistical technique that can detect and distinguish faulty data from malicious data in a distributed sensor network. Detecting faults and attacks is essential to ensure the correct semantic of the network, while distinguishing faults from attacks is necessary to initiate a correct recovery action. The approach uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the error/attack-free dynamics of the environment and the dynamics of error/attack data. It then performs a structural analysis of these HMMs to determine the type of error/attack affecting sensor observations. The methodology is demonstrated with real data traces collected over one month of observation from motes deployed on the Great Duck Island","","0-7695-2607-1","","10.1109/DSN.2006.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1633536","","Biosensors;Chemical and biological sensors;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Fault detection;Hidden Markov models;Intelligent networks;Performance analysis;Proposals;Speech recognition","hidden Markov models;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","HMM;distributed sensor network attacks;error detection;error-attack data;fault detection;hidden Markov models;on-the-fly statistical technique","","6","1","14","","","25-28 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework collects network packets and host events continuously in real-time and parses them to a queue of dynamic windows, then it generates connection vectors accordingly.

Security is one of the major issues which reduces the growth of Cloud computing and complications with data privacy and data protection continue to plague the market. In this paper, we propose a solution for Hybrid Cloud security, focusing on a Virtual Intrusion Detection System (V-IDS).

However, malicious nodes in a wireless and mobile ad hoc environment can jeopardize the security of the network if the issues of secure data exchange are not properly handled. Encryption cannot fully protect the data communicated between nodes, as routing information may expose the identities of the communicating nodes and put their relationships at risk. In this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous routing protocol that uses a mobile agent paradigm for wireless and mobile ad hoc networks. In our protocol, only trustworthy nodes are allowed to participate in communications and the misbehavior of malicious nodes is thus prevented effectively. We describe our protocol and provide its performance evaluation based on simulation experiments implemented in an ns-2 simulator.

Further, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban scenarios, like smart cities. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system, called INTI (Intrusion detection of SiNkhole attacks on 6LoWPAN for InterneT of ThIngs), to identify sinkhole attacks on the routing services in IoT. Moreover, INTI aims to mitigate adverse effects found in IDS that disturb its performance, like false positive and negative, as well as the high resource cost. The system combines watchdog, reputation and trust strategies for detection of attackers by analyzing the behavior of devices. Results show the INTI performance and its effectiveness in terms of attack detection rate, number of false positives and false negatives.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140344","","Base stations;Internet of things;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;security of data","6LoWPAN;INTI;Internet of Things;IoT networks;intrusion detection system;secure routing;sinkhole attacks","","0","","16","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing models assume that the distributions for transitions between states are exponential. However, this assumption does not hold in many real cases. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-Markov survivability evaluation model, which allows the transitions between states to follow nonexponential distributions. Novel quantitative measures are also proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient system in surviving intrusions. Model validation, which is possibly the most important step in the life cycle of model development, is largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, a real intrusion tolerant database system ITDB is implemented to validate the proposed state-space models. Empirical experiments show that the semi-Markov model predicts the system behaviors with high accuracy. Furthermore, in this paper we evaluate the impact of intrinsic system deficiencies and attack behaviors on the survivability of intrusion tolerant database systems.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438108","Database Security;Intrusion Tolerance;Modeling and Evaluation;Semi-Markov Process;Survivability","Availability;Benchmark testing;Data security;Database systems;Degradation;Educational institutions;Humans;Information security;Predictive models","Markov processes;database management systems;reliability theory;security of data;state-space methods","ITDB;intrinsic system deficiencies;intrusion tolerant database systems;nonexponential distributions;novel quantitative measures;resilient system;semi Markov survivability evaluation model;state-space models;system behaviors","","2","","19","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This architecture is based on hierarchy, which consists of a root node, several branch nodes and leaf nodes.

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV. This implies that we have achieved added security with less additional cost to the system.","","978-1-4577-0110-8","","10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983282","Performance;SAODV;routing attacks on AODV","Ad hoc networks;IP networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocols;MANET;SAODV routing protocols;asymmetric key cryptography;exchanged control messages;network routing attacks;secure routing;temporal time stamping;vulnerability assessment","","1","","18","","","20-22 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of security mechanisms have been proposed for sensor networks to provide data confidentiality: 1) advanced encryption system; 2) KATAN; 3) LED; and 4) TWINE. However, these schemes have drawbacks, including security vulnerabilities, need for hardware-based implementation, and higher computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight block cipher based on chaotic map and genetic operations. The proposed cryptographic scheme employs elliptic curve points to verify the communicating nodes and as one of the chaotic map parameters to generate the pseudorandom bit sequence. This sequence is used in XOR, mutation, and crossover operations in order to encrypt the data blocks. The experimental results based on Mica2 sensor mote show that the proposed encryption scheme is nine times faster than the LED protocol and two times faster than the TWINE protocol. We have also performed a number of statistical tests and cryptanalytic attacks to evaluate the security strength of the algorithm and found the cipher provably secure.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2380816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985604","Chaotic map;Crossover;Data Encryption;Elliptic curve;Mutation;Pseudorandom bit sequence generator;Wireless Sensor Network;Wireless sensor network;chaotic map;crossover;data encryption;elliptic curve;mutation;pseudorandom bit sequence generator","Ciphers;Elliptic curves;Encryption;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","chaotic communication;computational complexity;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;random sequences;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","KATAN;LED protocol;Mica2 sensor mote;TWINE protocol;XOR;chaotic map parameters;computational complexity;cryptanalytic attacks;cryptographic scheme;data blocks;elliptic curve points;encryption scheme;encryption system;environmental management;genetic operations;industry control;lightweight block cipher;pseudorandom bit sequence;security mechanisms;security strength;statistical tests;strategic surveillance;structural health monitoring;wireless sensor networks","","1","","31","","2014-12-18","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is very important for IDS to function properly for the efficient functioning of a MANET. In this paper, we try to build an IDS based on a co-operative scheme to detect intrusions in a mobile ad hoc network using basic game theory concepts. To identify the intrusion we deal with two layers - the application layer with underlying grid architecture and the network layer. We simulate a couple of intrusions in each of the two layers and look to resolve them using the coalition formation of the mobile nodes. These nodes obey the shapely value phenomena of the game theory concept and form coalitions to report intrusions in the network.","","978-1-4244-2962-2","978-1-4244-2963-9","10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760460","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile communication;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET;cluster based cooperative game theory;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;mobile ad-hoc grid","","0","","7","","","14-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, little research work has been done in actually implementing such a scheme based on statistical methods. In this paper, we present an efficient anomaly detection algorithm based on a statistical method originated from pattern recognition, which can effectively identify abnormal behavior such as mobility pattern of MANETs. In the proposed algorithm, the mobility pattern of a specific node is characterized by a multi-leaf tree structure, second-level nodes stands for the possible starting points and leaf nodes stand for the destination node of each possible path. Since our algorithm is using statistical method, a normal profile for each node is generated through extensive experiments, where the specific tree generated may have several starting points and ending with several destination points. For each path between any two nodes (parent and children), we can get the distribution of every different mobility pattern. By comparing the mobility patterns with the training data, we can distinguish abnormal nodes from normal behavior nodes in mobile Ad Hoc networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed detection algorithm can achieve good performance in terms of false alarm rate and detection rate for nodes with regular mobility patterns.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","1-4244-0357-X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150901","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Scalability;Security;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;pattern recognition;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics)","MANET;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility patterns;mobility profile;multi-leaf tree structure;pattern recognition","","2","","13","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is hard to find an exact mathematical model to describe this decision-making process because there are a lot of factors in the process and these factors interact each other. Fuzzy cognitive maps aim to mimic the reasoning process of the human. FCMs are able to capture and imitate the nature of human being in describing, representing and developing models. They are good at processing fuzzy and rough information and have adaptive, intelligent features. This paper presents a FCM-based decision support mechanism, which synthetically takes all of the related factors into account, offering objective parameters for setting up the intrusion response plan and choosing response measures. The mechanism is robust, adaptive and simple.","","0-7803-8403-2","","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382066","","Area measurement;Decision making;Delay;Fuzzy cognitive maps;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Robustness","cognitive systems;decision making;decision support systems;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy systems;security of data","automatic intrusion response system;decision making process;decision support mechanism;fuzzy cognitive maps;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response plan;mathematical model;reasoning process;rough information processing","","5","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second International Symposium on","20091023","2009","2","","34","38","High-speed packet content inspection and filtering devices rely on a fast multi-pattern matching algorithm which is used to detect predefined keywords or signatures in the packets. In TCP, a communication data stream is split into packets. Therefore, a target pattern may span multiple packets. Such fragmented pattern cannot be discovered by a per-packet scan. This is a serious problem in applications such as NIDS that require a complete scan. To avoid the problem, it is necessary to scan TCP streams. Stream-level parallelism is not a substantial solution because bandwidth depends on the number of active TCP streams. To scan each stream separately using one matching unit, the match states must be swapped appropriately. Another problem is, as parts of network infrastructure, the inspection units should support the function of QoS. In this paper, we proposed a multi-pattern matching automaton DSC-AC for high speed multi-stream packet scanning. We given out the construction of DSC-AC and optimized it with optimal and two binary searching tree and bit-map AC. Analysis and test showed that the optimized DSC-AC is capable of lightweight switching , enables a little state saving between streams and support the Diff-Serv Qos model. Furthermore, our method also enables easy implementation of multi-stream scanners with high throughput.","","978-0-7695-3643-9","","10.1109/ISECS.2009.144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5209819","Automaton;High-speed network;Multi-stream Content Detection;Pattern Matching","Automata;Bandwidth;Filtering algorithms;Information technology;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Testing;Throughput","DiffServ networks;pattern matching;quality of service;transport protocols","Diff-Serv;QoS;TCP;binary searching tree;bit-map AC;multipattern matching;multistream content detection;packet content inspection;packet scanning","","0","","12","","","22-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various approaches to Intrusion Detection are currently being used, but they are relatively in effective. Recently applying Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and data mining techniques to IDS are increasing. Artificial Intelligence plays a driving role in security services. An intrusion detection method based on neural network and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA) is presented in this paper. The novel structure model has higher accuracy and faster convergence speed. With the ability of strong self-learning and faster convergence, this intrusion detection method can detect various intrusion behaviors rapidly and effectively by learning the typical intrusion characteristic information. Utilizing the character that rough set can keep the discernability of original dataset after reduction, the reduces of the original dataset are calculated and used to train neural network, which increase the detection accuracy.

Each day the news media report yet another security breach-sometimes a localized single crime or prank at others, a denial-of-service attack affecting millions of people. As electronic commerce becomes increasingly pervasive, the subject can only become more critical. One of the more interesting techniques for enhancing information system security is detecting that an intrusion has taken place. Although intrusion-detection systems have been a part of the information security landscape for over 25 years, their proper role in the overall security picture is often misunderstood. They are not preventative security measures. Most often, they are used as active security mechanisms in conjunction with other (passive) information assurance processes like firewalls, smart cards, and virtual private networks. In practice, an intrusion-detection system (IDS) attempts to detect attacks or attack preparations by monitoring either the traffic on a computer network or the application or operating system activities within a computer. Once such behavior is detected, the IDS may alert a security administrator or it may invoke an automated response (such as closing down external communication paths or initiating a mechanism to trace the source of an attack). If an IDS detects attack behavior soon enough, it might be able to invoke a response to thwart the attack.","0018-9235","","","10.1109/6.887597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887597","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Electronic commerce;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Smart cards;Virtual private networks","information systems;security of data","active security mechanisms;computer network traffic monitoring;denial-of-service attack;electronic commerce;information systems security;intrusion-detection systems;localized single crime;security breach","","12","4","","","","Dec 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"WinWizard: Expanding Xen with a LibVMI Intrusion Detection Tool","Lamps, J.; Palmer, I.; Sprabery, R.","Comput.

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection. WinWinzard has demonstrated to be successful in detecting these types of rootkits, while causing little additional overhead to other virtual machines being hosted on the same hy- ervisor.","","978-1-4799-5062-1","","10.1109/CLOUD.2014.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973823","Intrusion Detection Systems;Virtualized-based security;Xen","Instruction sets;Kernel;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;LibVMI intrusion detection tool;WinWizard;Xen;cloud infrastructures;intrusion detection system;memory introspection;virtual machine introspection","","0","","26","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry, UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal-processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is ""near continuous wave (CW)"" performance in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The response from two parallel receive cables is fed to a full synchronous detection receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second.","","0-7803-8506-3","","10.1109/CCST.2004.1405387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405387","","Coaxial cables;Communication industry;Correlators;Field programmable gate arrays;Monitoring;Radar signal processing;Sampling methods;Spread spectrum radar;Target tracking;Ultra wideband radar","alarm systems;coaxial cables;radar signal processing;safety systems;spread spectrum radar;target tracking;ultra wideband radar","100 to 200 m;11.6 m;CCTV assessment;CW leaky cable sensors;FPGA;GUIDAR technology;Golay codes;Homeland Security;amplitude response;burial depth;cable length;cable spacing;calibrated threshold;chip rate;commercial requirements;communications industry;complementary orthogonal codes;composite coded pulse response;field programmable gate array;governmental requirements;guided radar;in-phase response;industrial requirements;leaky coaxial cable technology;leaky coaxial cables;medium homogeneity;military operations;multiple range bin accumulators;multiple range bins;multiple simultaneous targets;near continuous wave;nuisance alarms;orthogonal complementary codes;parallel receive cables;pinpoint location;prisons;quadrature-phase response;radar signal processing;residential requirements;sensor sensitivity;signal-processing techniques;spread spectrum technology;synchronous detection receiver;synchronous sampling;target capture;thumbtack correlation functions;ultra high-speed digital correlator;ultra wide band radar;ultra-high speed correlation;video motion sensors","","2","","6","","","11-14 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
