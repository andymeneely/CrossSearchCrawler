Proceedings of 16th International Conference on","20070924","2007","","","652","657","Worms are a significant threat to network systems, both through resource consumption and malicious activity. This paper examines the spread of a class of hitlist-based worms that attempt to propagate by searching for address book files on the host system and using the host's mail program to spread to the addresses found. This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected. This paper provides a complete description of a method to allow for better containment of this class of worms. The results of the proposed method are examined and compared to a previous method of capturing this type of worm.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-1251-8","978-1-4244-1251-8","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317891","honeytokens;polymorphic worms;worm capture;worm containment","Books;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer worms;Cryptography;Payloads;Postal services;Software standards;Software systems;Telecommunication traffic","electronic mail;invasive software;telecommunication security","e-mail address;honeytokens;polymorphic signatures;resource consumption;worm capture;worn containment","","0","","28","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the recent trend of high-speed networks, a large volume of data should be analyzed and processed with high-speed infrastructure. To promote the performance of network intrusion detection system and reduce the processing time of the traffic, present studies on network intrusion detection system for high-speed network focus on parallel techniques as an alternative. In this paper, a kind of parallelism is proposed to improve the performance of signature based intrusion detection system. The experimental results show that by the use of two signature based network intrusion detection systems running Snort in parallel with a portion of packets and a subset of rules, and distributing the traffic between them, the processing time of the traffic will be reduced.

As the majority of such systems, the proposal consists of two phases: a training phase and a detection phase. During the training phase a statistical model of the legitimate network usage is created through Bloom Filters and N-grams techniques. Subsequently, the results obtained by analyzing a dataset of attacks are compared with such model. This will allow a set of rules to be developed which will be able to determine whether the packets payloads contain malware. In the detection phase, the traffic to analyze is compared with the model created in the training phase and the results obtained when applying rules. The performed experiments showed really satisfactory results, with 100% malware detection and just 0.15% false positives.","1548-0992","","","10.1109/TLA.2015.7069114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069114","Anomaly;Bloom Filter;IDS;Intrusion Detection System;Malware;N-Gram;NIDS;Network Intrusion Detection System;Payload;Preprocessor;Snort","Computer science;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Malware;Payloads;Silicon compounds;Training","invasive software;statistical analysis","N-grams technique;Snort preprocessor component;anomaly-based network intrusion detection system;bloom filter;detection phase;malware detection;network traffic;statistical model;training phase","","0","","","","","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A tradeoff model for a system's dynamic performance and its security is presented. This model can be used to allocate system resources to provide sufficient protection and to satisfy the D-NCS's real-time dynamic performance requirements simultaneously. Then, the paper proposes a paradigm of the performance-security tradeoff optimization based on the coevolutionary genetic algorithm (CGA) for D-NCS. A Simulink-based test-bed is implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of this paradigm.

The techniques that are being investigated includes neural networks and fuzzy logic with network profiling, that uses simple data mining techniques to process the network data. The proposed system is a hybrid system that combines anomaly, misuse and host based detection. Simple Fuzzy rules, allow us to construct if-then rules that reflect common ways of describing security attacks.

DiMAPI extends the notion of the network flow with the scope attribute, which enables flow creation and manipulation over a set of local and remote monitoring sensors. Experiments with a number of applications on top of DiMAPI show that it has reasonable performance, while the response latency is very close to the actual round trip time between the monitoring application and the monitoring sensors.

Hence, there is a need to take proper attention to overcome the vulnerabilities in the web pages. SQLI (SQL Injection) is a commonly occurring vulnerability where the intruder tries to access the back end (database) using SQL Query. Lot of research work has been done so far in order to prevent SQLI but still the problem remains as a challenge. Since, most of the technique will try to fix the problem in one perspective but in the other end there will be a huge flaw too. Hence, we require a proper system to detect the SQLI completely. Here, we are presenting a system which detects all type of SQLI vulnerabilities after elaborately reviewing the existing methods. Experimental result shows that our proposed system detects all type of SQLI vulnerability when compared with the existing techniques.","","978-1-4799-8466-4","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229717","SQL Query and intruders;SQLI;Vulnerabilities;Web attacks","Accuracy;Business;Databases;Encoding;Integrated circuits;Monitoring;Security","Internet;SQL;Web sites;security of data;string matching","Internet;LCS method;SQL injection vulnerability detection;SQL query;SQLI vulnerability detection system;Web page vulnerabilities;business information sharing;personal information sharing;string matching","","0","","16","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, intrusion detection system based on NetFlow can solve these problems. NetFlow provides IP flow information in the network. Network administrators can use the NetFlow flow records for a variety of purposes, including network management, network planning, network security and so on. In the field of network security, IP flow information provided by NetFlow is used to analyze anomaly traffic. NetFlow based anomaly traffic analysis is an appropriate supplement to current signature-based NIDS. In this paper, we propose a NetFlow based intrusion detection system, which can detect several types of network attack from inside or outside based on the NetFlow data exported from the router or other network probes.

Not only does it shatter the confidence of customers towards e-commerce, but also causes electronic service providers tremendous economic loss. In order to safeguard the interests of customers, both academia and industrial practitioners have proposed various anti-phishing measures and online security policies. In this paper, we investigate the banking industry, which is one of the frequent targets of phishing, of two prominent international financial hubs - Hong Kong and Singapore. Our goal is to assess how well banks are prepared against phishing by analyzing security information available on their official Web sites. The result shows that among the four types of phishing attacks, banks in both places are well prepared to handle bogus Web sites but are inadequately prepared to handle phishing emails. In terms of method of presentation of security information, banks in both regions generally preferred FAQs and demonstrations. Despite some similarities, it is found that some regional factors like government advocacy played a significant role in adoption of the security measures. Through this research, we hope to give insights to both industry practitioners and academic researchers about preparedness of banks against phishing.","","978-1-4244-1529-8","978-1-4244-1529-8","10.1109/IEEM.2007.4419521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4419521","Anti-phishing;banks;fraudulent Web sites;fraudulent emails;identity theft;phishing","Application software;Banking;Computer crime;Electronic commerce;Electronic mail;Gain control;Government;Information analysis;Information security;Skin","Web sites;banking;electronic commerce;security of data","Hong Kong banks;Singapore banks;anti-phishing preparedness;e-commerce industry;electronic service;handle phishing emails;official Web sites;online security policies;security information","","2","","15","","","2-4 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network.

Often called “intrusion location capability”, this capability also presents inherent features such as; more accuracy in camera pre-set positioning, temporary disabling of sub-zone and individual sensitivity level per sub-zone. However, even though the market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact on the overall system cost. The paper shows how synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length. In other word, for a typical zone length of 100 meters, the zone is subdivided in to up to ten equally spaced sub-zones of 10 meters each, giving an intrusion crossing point resolution of 10 meters. Synergistic radar technology can be applied to buried, surface, wall and roof applications.

The proposed QSV method is based on quick sampling of the input stream against fixed-length pattern prefixes, and on-demand verification of variable-length pattern suffixes. Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure. The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases. Our design was evaluated using the ClamAV virus database having 82,888 strings with a total size that exceeds 8 Mbyte. In terms of byte count, 99.3 percent of the pattern set is handled by the QSV method and 0.7 percent of the pattern set is handled by P-AC. A pattern with distinct 16-byte prefix only occupies up to three lookup table entries in QSV. The overall memory cost of our system is about 1.4 Mbyte, i.e., 1.4 bit per character of the ClamAV pattern set. The proposed method is memory-based, hence, updates to the pattern set can be accommodated by modifying the contents of the lookup tables without reconfiguring the hardware circuits.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669261","String searching;antivirus system;embedded system.;system security","Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Engines;Hardware;Memory management;Pattern matching;Table lookup","computer viruses;formal verification;pipeline processing;sampling methods;search engines;string matching;table lookup","QSV method;antivirus system;fixed length pattern prefixe;lookup tables;on-demand verification;pipelined Aho-Corasick architecture;quick sampling;search engine;string searching;variable length pattern suffixes;virus scanning","","2","","27","","2010-12-17","Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As rule-base IDS can gain good detecting performance, we build a genetic immune model, which is adaptive to rule-based IDS, to improve the IDS's detecting performance of new attacks. As one successful method, state transition (ST) analysis models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from initial state to a target compromised state. Using this model of recomposing the ST method to solve the low recognizing ratio problem is presented in this paper. In this model, ST method can be expressed in a double DNA chains pattern. One chain is the system state chain; the other is an action chain. The double twisting chains form a state-action sequence to represent the system state transitions. In order to still gain the recognizing performance of the regular ID systems, we use STAT rules to create the initial non-self (or expert) DNA library, and newly found attacking-rules can still be added to the library.

For reasons of ensuring privacy, we adopt the notion of l-Diversity in the course of collecting intrusion logs from organizations. Within our framework, an organization ensures the people in the center cannot discern the exact origin of any intrusion log among the other l-1 organizations. Also, it is not possible to precisely identify the classification type of an intrusion log from among other l-1 types. Within this framework, the intrusion log management center can analyze the anonymous data, since the proposed privacy preserving solution creates little information loss. If required, it sends an alarm to the appropriate organization within a reasonable time.

So optimization methods using dynamic traffic characteristics are exploited. Our contributions lie in three folds. Firstly, a novel best classification tree is formally defined aiming to minimize the visit cost of the traffic in the slot, based on which optimization methods are exploited. Secondly, Packet Feature Entropy is proposed to measure how efficiently a packet field can partition the traffic, and the popular 14 packet fields used in Snort are investigated in detail by 10Gbps backbone trace and Netflow data.

In this paper, we first propose an extension of an IDS based on information flow control. We address issues concerning programs execution and improve its expressiveness in terms of security policy. This extended model can be configured to reach a wide variety of different security goals. Particularly, it allows for information flow checking based on users and/or programs dependent policy rules. Furthermore, suspicious modification of binary programs can be detected to avoid malware execution. We also propose an algorithm for deriving an AppArmor MAC policy into an information flow policy, and thus get the advantage of having a ready to use policy offering good security.

Instead of managing all ongoing traffic on the network, D-SAT only monitors SYN count and ratio between SYN and other TCP packets at first time. And it detects SYN flooding and finds victims more accurately in its second stage. To make the detection mechanism robustly and easily, D-SAT uses CUSUM (cumulative sum) approach in SPC (statistical process control) (H. Wang et al., 2002) (D.C. Montgomery, 2001) (D.M. Hawkins et al., 1998). It makes the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and easier to implement. D-SAT also employed AFM (aggregation flow management) for finding victims quickly and accurately. The trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that D-SAT system is efficient and simple to implement and prove that it detects SYN flooding accurately and finds attack in a very short detection time.","","0-7695-2262-9","","10.1109/SAINT.2005.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386144","","Electronic mail;Floods;Network servers;Process control;Protection;Robust control;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;authorisation;statistical process control;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","D-SAT system;SYN flooding attack detection;TCP packets;aggregation flow management;cumulative sum;network traffic;statistical approach;statistical process control","","4","1","14","","","31 Jan.-4 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proprietary sensor field buses have quickly displaced dry contacts for PIDS installations; this has lead to ongoing compatibility issues with third party systems such as Security Management Systems (SMS), Physical Security Information Managers (PSIM), Video management systems and building management systems. Several approaches have been proposed to create a standard interface at the sensor level. However, these approaches compromise the ability to view data on a global level for the purpose of advanced diagnostics and performance improvement. A method for transacting data from the proprietary sensor bus to a third party system via an industry standardized interface would allow manufacturers to focus their development efforts on better sensor products.

Apart from reducing the processing overhead through minimization of the feature space, the autonomous identification of such sub-groups of features can readily enable IDS's to develop classifiers that are more apt at separating normal traffic from anomalous traffic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this techniques by generating feature sets from a collection of network traffic and applying them to the training and detection phases of a payload-based IDS. The results show that it is able to separate network attacks while maintaining low false positive rates.

We show that a simple approach based on cascading classification leads to the classification cost of 0.2079. Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples. We argue that cascading classification is a viable alternative in scenarios where less complex machine learning approaches are favorable, for example due to possible performance degradation in resource constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems or sensors.","2166-0662","978-1-4799-3857-5","","10.1109/ISMS.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280878","Exact Euclidean Locality Sensitive Hashing (E2LSH);KDD99 classifier learning contest;cascading classification;intrusion detection;k-nearest-neighbor classification","Accuracy;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Probes;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","cascading classification;clustering approach;machine learning;network intrusion detection","","","","","","","27-29 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the systems that perform deep packet inspection implement basic string matching algorithms to match packets against large but finite strings. However, there is growing interest in the use of regular expression-based pattern matching, since regular expressions offer superior expressive power. DFA is employed to implement regular expression matching. DFA representations of a regular expression sets in network applications require large amounts of memory, limiting their practical application.

In this work, we coin the term Internet worm tomography as inferring the characteristics of Internet worms from the observations of Darknet or network telescopes that monitor a routable but unused IP address space. Under the framework of Internet worm tomography, we attempt to infer Internet worm temporal behaviors, i.e., the host infection time and the worm infection sequence, and thus pinpoint patient zero or initially infected hosts. Specifically, we apply statistical estimation techniques and propose method of moments, maximum likelihood, and linear regression estimators. We show analytically and empirically that our proposed estimators can better infer worm temporal characteristics than a naive estimator that has been used in the previous work.

As underlying devices in SDN, SDN switches must maintain a large number of hardware counters. Implementation of these counters faces serious challenges for SDN switches, i.e., High memory consumption and inflexibility. Thus, we previously proposed Software Defined Hardware Counters (SDHC), which decouples definition and implementation of counters to overcome these challenges. However, like traditional hardware counters, SDHC only supports passive statistical mode (i.e., The values of the counters can be only read passively by the controller). Based on the passive mode, most of applications need to send request messages at some frequency to obtain statistics, which causes some critical problems for SDN: i) low statistical accuracy, ii) high network bandwidth consumption. Hyper Software Defined Hardware Counters (Hyper SDHC) is thus proposed by extending SDHC. Through introducing the timer-triggering and updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms, Hyper SDHC can naturally support active statistical mode, i.e., Counters actively report their values according to triggering condition. It can greatly enhance the statistical accuracy and reduce network bandwidth consumption between controller and switch. The demo of Hyper SDHC is implemented based on Net Magic platform. The demo will exhibit how Hyper SDHC works and how it supports a typical video quality monitor application.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037744","Software Defined Networking (SDN);active statistical mode;counters","Bandwidth;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Software;Switches","software defined networking;statistical analysis","Net Magic platform;SDHC;SDN switches;hyper software defined hardware counters;low statistical accuracy;network bandwidth consumption;software defined networking;timer-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms;updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms","","0","","8","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Critical challenges of these applications are the increasing level of inter-component dependencies and the customized growth, which make recurrent deployment of such applications, as the one required in private clouds, labor intensive and error prone. In this paper we investigate the type of issues faced when deploying a cloud computing management infrastructure and propose a solution to self-assist the deployment. We show how by leveraging virtual image technologies we can detect faulty installations and their signatures early in the deployment process.

This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations.

We further classify the wormhole scenarios into successful, unsuccessful, doubtful, interesting, and uninteresting.

This paper introduces a specification-based detection engine that is built upon the functionality and limitations of the 802.11 MAC protocol, expanding the detection range of such engines in MANETs. The proposed detection engine is deployed at each node and performs detection using a set of specifications, which describe the correct operation of the MAC protocol operating at the host node. The proposed engine introduces a number of significant advantages since it can effectively detect both known and unknown attacks in real time and with minimum overhead. Moreover, it is resilient to the dynamic topologies that are common in MANETs and its deployment requires no protocol modifications.","","978-1-4577-1721-5","978-1-4577-1720-8","10.1109/WONS.2012.6152225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152225","802.11 vulnerabilities;IDS;MANET security;data-link layer attacks;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc networks;security vulnerabilities;specification-based intrusion detection engine","Ad hoc networks;Engines;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Media Access Protocol;Mobile computing;Monitoring","access protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE802.11 MAC protocol security;MANET;anomaly-based detection;dynamic topology;host node;signature-based detection;specification-based intrusion detection engine","","0","","21","","","9-11 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the defense mechanisms against the network attacks is using a baseline profile established during normal operation to detect the traffic that deviates from the baseline profile. However, this approach works only if there is a stable base profile representing the legitimate network traffic. Although there has been some preliminary research, the details of profiling, such as the profile format, its size and the traffic stability by site or time, have not been widely available. In this study, we analyze actual traffic traces from two Internet traffic archives and verify the traffic stability by various aspects. The analysis shows that there are significant differences in the traffic patterns among different sites. In addition, there are some differences between different time of day or different days, even within a site, suggesting that different profiles are needed for different times.

T2 FL is an extension of Type-1 FL which proved to be successful in modeling and minimizing the effects of various kinds of dynamic uncertainties. In this paper, T2 FL provides a basis for robust anomaly detection and cyber security state awareness. In addition, the proposed algorithm was specifically developed to comply with the constrained computational requirements of low-cost embedded network security cyber sensors.

The increasing number of network security related incidents makes it necessary for organizations to actively protect their sensitive data with the installation of intrusion detection systems (IDS). Detecting intrusion in distributed network from outside network segment as well as from inside is a difficult problem. Intrusion detection system must analyze a large volume of data while not placing a significant added load on the monitoring systems and networks. The deficiency of centralized intrusion detection systems leads the idea of mobile agents. In an agent based IDS idea, there is no central station, therefore no central point of failure. Agents can detect and take predefined actions against malicious activity. The system shows a superior performance compared to central sniffing IDS techniques, and saves network resources compared to other distributed IDSs that activate too many sniffers causing bottlenecks in the network. This is one of the major motivations to use the distributed model based on mobile agent platform. This paper presents survey of distributed intrusion detection system based on mobile agents.

The simulation results show that SIDS is a promising methodology for this important problem.","","0-7695-2221-1","","10.1109/BROADNETS.2004.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1363856","DSR;MANET;fuzzy logic;intrusion detection;sinkhole","Ad hoc networks;Context modeling;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Logic;Military communication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing protocols;Vehicle dynamics","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DSR MANET;dynamic source routing protocol;fuzzy logic;routing protocol;sinkhole intrusion indicator;wireless mobile ad hoc network","","11","","13","","","25-29 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Detecting Spam Zombies by Monitoring Outgoing Messages","Duan, Z.; Peng Chen; Sanchez, F.; Yingfei Dong; Stephenson, M.; Barker, J.","Florida State Univ., Tallahassee, FL","INFOCOM 2009, IEEE","20090602","2009","","","1764","1772","Compromised machines are one of the key security threats on the Internet; they are often used to launch various security attacks such as DDoS, spamming, and identity theft. In this paper we address this issue by investigating effective solutions to automatically identify compromised machines in a network. Given that spamming provides a key economic incentive for attackers to recruit the large number of compromised machines, we focus on the subset of compromised machines that are involved in the spamming activities, commonly known as spam zombies. We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised. Moreover, only 7 internal IP addresses associated with compromised machines in the trace are missed by SPOT.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062096","","Aggregates;Condition monitoring;Error analysis;Internet;Power generation economics;Probability;Recruitment;Sequential analysis;Statistical analysis;Unsolicited electronic mail","IP networks;Internet;electronic messaging;probability;security of data;statistical testing;unsolicited e-mail","DDoS;IP addresses;Internet;SPOT;U.S. campus network;compromised machines;identity theft;outgoing messages monitoring;security attacks;security threats;sequential probability ratio test;spam zombie detection system;spam zombies detection;spamming activity;statistical tool","","0","3","13","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on intrinsic characteristics of bots, we propose a multi-module approach to correlate information from different host- and network-level aspects and design a multi-layered architecture to efficiently coordinate modules to perform heavy monitoring only when necessary. We have implemented our proposed system and evaluated on real-world benign and malicious programs running on several diverse real-life office and home machines for several days. The final results show that our system can detect all 15 real-world bots (e.g., Waledac, Storm) with low false positives (0.68%) and with minimal overhead. We believe EFFORT raises a higher bar and this host-network cooperated design represents a timely effort and a right direction in the malware battle.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195713","","Correlation;Engines;Feature extraction;Malware;Monitoring;Servers;Support vector machines","invasive software","EFFORT;bots intrinsic characteristics;efficient and effective bot malware detection;host-and network-level aspects;host-network cooperated detection framework;malicious programs;malware battle;module coordination;multilayered architecture design;multimodule approach;real-world benign programs","","2","","23","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further to this, based on the models, we propose an efficient SIP DoS attack defense scheme which is using priority queue and bandwidth control method.

The B-dIDS is composed of two key components: a big data processing engine and an analytics engine. The big data processing is done through HAMR, which is a next generation in-memory MapReduce engine. HAMR has reported high speedups over existing big data solutions across several analytics algorithms. The analytics engine comprises a novel ensemble algorithm, which extracts training data from clusters of the multiple IDS alarms. The clustering is utilized as a preprocessing step to re-label the datasets based on their high similarity to known potential attacks. The overall aim is to predict multi-pronged attacks that are spread across multiple subnets but can be missed if not evaluated in an integrated manner.","","","","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004484","Ensemble learning;big data;distributed Intrusion Detection System","Big data;Data mining;Engines;Heat-assisted magnetic recording;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Training","Big Data;data mining;security of data","B-dIDS;HAMR;MapReduce engine;analytics engine;big data processing engine;big-distributed intrusion detection system;multiple IDS alarms;multipronged attacks","","0","","12","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of their attractive applications, MANET poses high security problems compared to conventional wired and wireless networks due to its unique characteristics such as lack of central coordination, dynamic topology, temporary network life and wireless nature of communication. Attack prevention measures, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. Intrusion detection on MANET is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management and highly resource constrained nodes. Conventional intrusion detection system developed for wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET. It needs to be redesigned to suit the ad hoc technology. The proposed system introduces new architecture that uses machine learning approach to maximize the detection accuracy. Proposed IDS architecture uses the combination of Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make use of the excellent accuracy of SVM and better performance of RST.","","978-1-4799-3835-3","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033949","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning;Mobile ad hoc Networks;Rough Set Theory and Support Vector Machine;Security issues","Approximation methods;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Set theory;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","IDS architecture;MANET;RST;SVM;ad hoc technology;attack prevention measures;authentication techniques;centralized management;dynamic topology;encryption;highly resource constrained nodes;instant wireless networking;intrusion detection systems;machine learning;mobile ad hoc networking;mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security problems;support vector machine;temporary network life;wired networks;wireless devices","","0","","10","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such, an intrusion detection system (IDS) capable of detecting potential cross site scripting attacks is demonstrated. The IDS involves the capturing of potential client side executable content on a Web page and the hashing of that content. At a future point in time, the Web page is reprocessed for client side executable content and the content rehashed, with any differences in the hash values indicative of a potential XSS attack. It is believed that the described IDS technique would be particularly useful for Web forums and other user content driven site, since the IDS only considers content recognized as potentially executable and not normal text content, such as that which would be typically enclosed in paragraph or heading tags.","","978-1-4577-1342-2","","10.1109/LISAT.2012.6223107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6223107","Perl;XSS;information security;intrusion detection","Browsers;HTML;Intrusion detection;Vectors;Web pages","Perl;Web sites;security of data","Perl based IDS technique;Web page;Web sites;XSSmon;intrusion detection system;potential XSS attack detection;potential client side executable content;potential cross site scripting attack detection","","2","","5","","","4-4 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20070529","2007","","","1289","1297","Third generation (3G) wireless networks based on the CDMA2000 and UMTS standards are now increasingly being deployed throughout the world. Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735","","3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation","","18","1","28","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
