Such expressions can be handled in hardware using a bit-parallel (BP) architecture based on the Glushkov non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). However, many expressions contain constrained {min, max} repetitions which first need to be unrolled so that they can be handled by the standard BP system. Such unrolling often leads to an excessive memory requirement which makes handling of such regexes unfeasible. This study presents a solution, based on the standard BP architecture, which incorporates a counting mechanism that renders unrolling unnecessary. As a result, many regexes, which were previously unsuitable for the standard BP system, can now be efficiently handled. Unlike many other approaches, this architecture is dynamically reconfigurable thanks to its memory, rather than logic, based engine. This is important as NIDS rule sets are regularly updated. It can also handle repetition of both single and multi-symbol sub-expressions.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6673707","","","computer network security;digital signatures;finite automata;symbol manipulation","Glushkov nondeterministic flnite automata;NFA;NIDS;NIDS rule sets;attack signatures;bit-parallel architecture;constrained repetitions;deep packet inspection;hardware acceleration;multisymbol subexpressions;network intrusion detection systems;regular expression repetitions;standard BP system","","0","","","","","December 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Often, these factors drive the security designers to design a perimeter intrusion detection and assessment system (PIDAS) that includes: 1) larger than desired footprint, 2) one or more animal control fences to minimize the nuisance alarm rate (NAR), and 3) clear zones and an isolation zone to facilitate intrusion detection and assessment by keeping the fence lines clear of vegetation, trash, and other objects that could impede the security system's performance.

However in case people make protection profiles using both ""Guide for the Production of PPs and STs"" and the common criteria, they confront some problems when defining requirements for network-wide systems instead of a single system. Many requirements in the CC are described based on a single system's activities. We found that network-wide product's PPs are required of different approach, where some statements in the CC are modified or newly extended. We show that how the network-wide targets of evaluation (TOEs) are different from a single system TOE in terms of its protection scope.

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each application has demands on the connectivity infrastructure such as availability, reliability, and data payload capability. Furthermore, wireless medical device applications may share RF spectrum resources with a host of other non medical device applications. Although hospitals traditionally segregate data network traffic and patient care data network traffic, the increased costs for a hospital to utilize two separate network infrastructures has led some to consider whether or not wireless medical devices should be integrated onto IT-type 802.11 wireless networks. While there are arguable advantages to incorporating all devices onto a single network infrastructure, there are increased potential patient safety risks that must be addressed. In order to address the increased risks of incorporating wireless medical devices on hospital's 802.11 wireless networks, thorough evaluation and testing is essential.

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240","Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection","Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training","Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data","Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access","","0","","19","","","19-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Outbound traffic are allowed in organizations since users are allowed at least to download mails, visit external web servers. A vulnerable application requesting traffic from an externally hosted server is exploited and user accessing the traffic transfers their controls to attackers listening remotely. To detect this kind of behavior, this paper focuses on deploying high interaction honeypot system coupled with intrusion detection system on different operating system flavors which work as clients. Clients collect URLs by specifically crafted web links crawler. These URLs are then visited by application needed to visit these URLs. Finally, if these URLs are malicious and exploit the application software, an alert is triggered by signature based intrusion detection system deployed on the machine. Based on these alerts, URLs are stored in a black list of malicious URLs.

This is due to the open nature of this medium that leaves it vulnerable to multiple security threats. Anyone with a transceiver can launch jamming based DoS attacks on wireless transmissions, inject spurious messages, or jam legitimate ones. Jamming attacks usually occur at physical and MAC layers and involves different methods, techniques and technology. Therefore designing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to propose a new IDS framework that enables detection and classification of jamming in physical and MAC layers in wireless networks. To address this, problems that arise due to jamming at both layers are identified and investigated. Lists of parameters and variables are associated with jamming are identified and formulated to detect and classify attacks. Finally a novel IDS framework for detecting and classifying jamming attacks is proposed. This framework is found to be able to detect and classify jamming faster and more efficient.","","978-1-4673-1326-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418660","Wireless Network;classification;detection;jamming;security","Benchmark testing;Business process re-engineering;Communication system security;Jamming;Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;jamming;pattern classification;radio networks","IDS framework;MAC layers;attack classification;intrusion detection system;jamming attack classification;jamming based DoS attacks;jamming detection;multiple security threats;physical layers;wireless networks;wireless transmissions","","0","","26","","","27-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","978-1-4244-6533-0","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Programmable logic arrays;Prototypes;Resource management;Scalability;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","DFA;FPGA;NFA;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;field programmable gate array;hardware implementation;nondeterministic finite automaton;prototype design implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection","","2","","28","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","0","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This complex expansion increases the productivity of SCADA networks; however, it also increases security risks and threats. The state-of-the-art Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are not capable enough of detecting anomalies and intrusions that may be aimed to disrupt the SCADA operations. This paper proposes a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) based on a community collaboration between multiple agents of anomaly detectors to identify anomaly behaviors in SCADA networks. The proposed architecture for DIDS incorporates the SCADA network topology and connectivity constraints. In this paper, detailed architecture, components, and functions of DIDS are described and attack scenarios are developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","","978-1-4577-0807-7","978-1-4577-0808-4","10.1109/ISAP.2011.6082170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6082170","Anomaly Detection;Cyber Security;Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems;Multi-Agent Systems;Neural Networks;SCADA Networks","Artificial neural networks;Correlation;Engines;IP networks;Payloads;Protocols;Substations","SCADA systems;multi-agent systems;security of data","SCADA network topology;SCADA operation;anomaly detectors;community collaboration;cyber intrusion detection system;data acquisition system architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed networks;industrial operation control;multiagent collaboration;productivity;protocols;security risk;supervisory control","","3","","19","","","25-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rescue robots are able to benefit an emergency response procedure by searching for survivors, providing access to inaccessible areas and establishing an on-site communication network. This paper investigates how a cyber attack on a rescue robot can adversely affect its operation and impair an emergency response operation. The focus is on identifying physical indicators of an ongoing cyber attack, which can help to design more efficient detection and defense mechanisms. A number of experiments have been conducted on an Arduino based robot, under different cyber attack scenarios. The results show that the cyber attack's effects have physical features that can be used in order to improve the robot's robustness against this type of threat.","","","","10.1109/PerComW.2014.6815228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6815228","cyber security;emergency response;rescue robots","Computer crime;Conferences;Emergency services;Mobile robots;Vehicles;Wheels","emergency services;robots;security of data","Arduino based robot;cyber attacks;defense mechanisms;detection mechanisms;emergency response procedure;emergency situation;on-site communication network;rescue robot","","0","","21","","","24-28 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has become a great challenge to develop scalable solutions for next-generation packet classification that support higher throughput, larger rule sets and more packet header fields. For low-cost high performance embedded networking applications, the best solution could be doing packet classification by special designed hardware, which can effectively release the burden of system CPU. In order to improve the speed of packet classification, exhibit good memory performance and support quick rule update, a high-speed packet classification system based on FPGA is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of parallel processing, pipeline and hardware circuit, the throughput has been improved greatly; defining the size of the tree nodes to be binary tree, the memory usage can be more efficient. The binary tree structure is generated through pre-processing on computer, which does not influence the searching speed of FPGA. During the packet header division, the division field is dynamic and selected according to the rules.

However, lightweight models using Trust Monitoring System (TMS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are limited. This paper presents a secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using TMS at node level and IDS at Base Station (BS) side. Each node in the network assesses the behavior of its neighbors using trust ratings and performs the network activities such as cluster head selection, data aggregation, and reporting to the BS. Then, BS analyzes the received information using IDS and reports the information about the malicious activities back to nodes in the network. In this way, the proposed model identifies and isolates the malicious nodes from the data aggregation process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this model.","","978-1-4799-6760-5","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2015.7150633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150633","Data aggregation;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;malicious activity;security;trust monitoring system","Computational modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Nickel;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","head selection;intrusion detection systems;secure data aggregation;trust monitoring system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","16-18 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many different type of worms in the wild, mostly categorized based on how they find and infect their new victims (i.e. active, passive, etc.). In this paper, we investigate a new approach for detecting passive worms and malware in P2P networks based on the popularity of files in the network.

A reputation-based model for malicious node detection in WSNs is proposed in this paper.

Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation. Thus, our major contribution is to provide an efficient scheme to detect data tampering while minimizing the overhead","1072-4451","0-7695-2732-9","","10.1109/MICRO.2006.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041841","","Access control;Degradation;Hardware;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Program processors;Protection;Runtime","authorisation;optimising compilers;program control structures;system monitoring","anomaly detection;control flow monitoring;data protection;data tampering;dynamic access control;intrusion detection;memory protection;microarchitecture;optimization;program compiler;program semantics","","2","","27","","","9-13 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can accurately detect and confine malicious Javascript in PDF with minor performance overhead.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903571","Malcode bearing PDF;document instrumentation;malicious Javascript;malware detection and confinement","Context;Feature extraction;Instruments;Malware;Monitoring;Portable document format;Runtime","Java;document handling;feature extraction;invasive software;ubiquitous computing","Javascript execution;Javascript support;PDF;context monitoring code;context-aware approach;document format;document instrumentation;embedded malware;emerging threat vector;evasion attempt;malicious Javascript confinement;malicious Javascript detection;malicious document identification;online protection system;potential infection attempt detection;runtime feature;runtime monitoring;security analysis;sophisticated adversaries;static feature extraction","","0","","47","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Integrated vehicle electronics (vetronics) offer improved performance, efficiency and new capabilities at the sub system, system and system-of-systems level. However, this integration is associated with magnified risk and compromise from cyber attacks. Potential cyber attacks could be from an external source where a node is accessed by a malicious intruder using NEC, or internal to the vehicle such as a passive attack waiting to be triggered by an event. This paper provides an understanding of applying survivable systems principles of preventive and reactive mechanisms to the vehicle's integrated vetronics in order to mitigate internal and external threats. Requirements are derived and a novel top level architecture for vetronics survivability is presented.","","","","10.1049/cp.2011.0249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6136914","Requirements;Safety;Security;Survivability;Vetronics","","military vehicles;security of data","cyber attacks;electronics architectures;integrated vehicle electronics;integrated vetronics survivability;magnified risk;malicious intruder;military vehicles;network enabled capability;passive attack;system-of-systems level","","0","","","","","20-22 Sept. 2011","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

They can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and via Feature selection improving classification by searching for the subset of features which best classifies the training data to detect attacks on computer system. The quality of features directly affects the performance of classification. Many feature selection methods introduced to remove redundant and irrelevant features, because raw features may reduce accuracy or robustness of classification. In this paper we compared three methods for feature selection based on Decision trees (DT), Flexible Neural Tree (FNT) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results based on comparison of three methods on DARPA KDD99 benchmark dataset indicate that DT has almost better accuracy.","","978-1-4244-5244-6","978-0-7695-3896-9","10.1109/ICCIT.2009.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369962","Decision Tree;Flexible Neural Tree;Intrusion Detection System;Particle Swarm Optimization","Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Decision trees;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Robustness;Training data","decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;security of data","anomalous patterns;attack detection;computer system;decision trees;feature reduction;feature selection;flexible neural tree;intrusion detection system;machine learning;network security;particle swarm optimization;pattern classification","","4","","8","","","24-26 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a randomization method to defend against these DoS attacks from the system-design perspective. We inject a certain degree of randomization into the Radio Resource Management (RRM) and Mobility Management (MM) procedure, so the parameters which are important to the attacks would be difficult to measure and the values measured would be much higher. Our simulation shows that the amount of signaling messages on the attack is decreased by 90% and the adverse impact to performance is just less than 10%.

Nodes may lose power, crash, or simply move out of range of other nodes in the network. Identifying the root cause is complicated by a lack of fixed monitoring and analysis infrastructure. Past research has focused on monitoring using either ping, heartbeat, or gossip-based approaches, which can incur significant network wide overhead. This paper proposes a novel k-hop cluster based data dissemination scheme that can piggyback on routing messages for more efficient detection of failures including node disconnection. In this scheme, nodes forward their neighbour-hood observations to a per-cluster failure detector based on the observed spanning tree. Simulations show that detecting disconnected nodes using a cross-layer implementation of the data dissemination scheme is more efficient while an application layer implementation is faster. This effect is more pronounced in sparse networks.","","978-1-4577-1588-4","978-3-901882-44-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104019","MANET;cross-layer;data dissemination;failure detection;network efficiency","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Detectors;Heart beat;Mobile computing;Protocols;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;trees (mathematics)","MANET;cross-layer cluster-based data dissemination;failure detection;k-hop cluster;neighbour-hood observation;node disconnection;node failure;routing message;spanning tree;sparse network","","0","","16","","","24-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a flow based system to detect anomalous activity by using IP flow characteristics with chi-square detection mechanism. This system provides solution to identify anomalous activities like scan and flood attack by means of automatic behavior analysis of the network traffic and also give detailed information of attacker, victim, type and time of the attack which can be used for corresponding defense. Anomaly Detection capability of the proposed system is compared with SNORT Intrusion detection system and results prove the very high detection rate of the system over SNORT for different scan and flood attack. The proposed system detects different stealth scan and malformed packets scan. Since the probability of using stealth scan in real attack is very high, this system can identify the real attacks in the initial stage itself and preventive action can be taken.","","978-1-4244-4790-9","978-1-4244-4791-6","10.1109/IADCC.2010.5422996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422996","Anomaly detection;chi-square;flow;scan detection","Computer networks;Floods;High-speed networks;IP networks;Information analysis;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","security of data","IDS;IPS;SNORT intrusion detection system;automatic behavior analysis;chi-square technique;firewall;flow based anomaly detection system;intrusion detection;malicious traffic;network traffic;security mechanisms","","0","","22","","","19-20 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the suffering problem of these systems is that a large amount of non-critical alarms will be generated during the detection process which increase the analysis burden and lower the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems in real deployment. We argue that this bottleneck stems primarily from the lack of information related to the actual settings. To mitigate this limitation, we advocate that the way of combining intrusion detection signatures with contextual information is a promising and effective solution. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the construction of contextual signatures in intrusion detection systems by means of hash function to identify and filter out non-critical alarms. Moreover, we indicate that our scheme is compatible to different representations of intrusion detection signatures. In the evaluation, we realize our generic scheme to a specific implementation and explore its performance in experimental settings.","","978-1-4577-2008-6","","10.1109/CIS.2011.219","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6128270","contextual signature;hash function;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Concrete;Databases;Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection","cryptography;digital signatures","contextual signatures;hash function;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","25","","","3-4 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overall security view of the multi-sensor intrusion detection system can serve as an aid to appraise the trustworthiness in the system. This paper presents our research effort in that direction by describing a decision engine for an intelligent intrusion detection system (IIDS) that fuses information from different intrusion detection sensors using an artificial intelligence technique. The decision engine uses fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) and fuzzy rule-bases for causal knowledge acquisition and to support the causal knowledge reasoning process. In this paper, we report on the workings of the decision engine that has been successfully embedded into the IIDS architecture being built at the Center for Computer Security Research (CCSR), Mississippi State University.","","0-7695-2056-1","","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265658","","Artificial intelligence;Data security;Engines;Fuzzy cognitive maps;Information security;Intelligent sensors;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems","artificial intelligence;fuzzy reasoning;knowledge acquisition;security of data;sensor fusion","artificial intelligence;causal knowledge acquisition;causal knowledge reasoning;fuzzy cognitive maps;fuzzy rule-bases;intelligent intrusion detection system;intrusion sensor data fusion;multisensor intrusion detection system","","13","","29","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152μ seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this taxonomy, characteristics and classifications of EFT threats are described, which can be benefited by domain IDS directly or can be updated into some form of ontology (e.g. OWL).

In many situations, these algorithms give increased performance such as better detectability and/or reduced false alarm rates. To achieve these benefits, typically some system or signal model is given. This work focuses on the situation where the event signal is unknown and a false alarm criterion must be met. Specifically, the case where data from multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors are processed to detect intrusion into a room while satisfying a false alarm constraint is analyzed. The central challenge is the space of intrusion signals is unknown and we want to quantify analytically the probability of false alarm. It is shown that this quantification is possible by estimating the background noise statistics and computing the Mahalanobis distance in the frequency domain. Using the Mahalanobis distance as the decision metric, a threshold is computed to satisfy the false alarm constraint.","","","","10.1109/SAS.2015.7133634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133634","","Frequency-domain analysis;Gaussian distribution;Noise;Noise measurement;Principal component analysis;Sensor fusion;Time series analysis","frequency-domain analysis;infrared detectors;probability;safety systems;security of data;sensor fusion;signal detection;statistics","Mahalanobis distance;PIR sensor;background noise statistics;false alarm probability constraint;frequency domain analysis;intrusion detection;multiple passive infrared sensor;sensor fusion algorithm","","1","","14","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the incident investigation, Intelligence gathering is the first phase of such attacks. To evade detection, hacker may make use of botnet, a set of zombie machines, to gain the access of a target and the zombies send the collected results back to the hacker. Even though the zombies would be blocked by detection system, the hacker, using the access information obtained from the botnet, would login the target from another machine without being noticed by the detection system. Such information gathering tactic can evade detection and the hacker grants the initial access to the target. The proposed defense system analyzes multiple logs from the network and extracts the reconnaissance attack sequences related to targeted attacks. State-based model is adopted to model the steps of the above early phase attack performed by multiple scouts and an intruder and such attack events in a long time frame becomes significant in the state-aware model. The results show that the proposed system can identify the attacks at the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","978-1-4799-2652-7","","10.1109/WAINA.2014.134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844748","intrusion detection;pervasive computing;targeted attacks","Computer hacking;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Joints;Reconnaissance;Servers","authorisation;data privacy;invasive software;ubiquitous computing","botnet;cyber attack;information privacy;intelligence gathering;network infrastructure;state-based model;targeted attack prevention","","1","","18","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.","2151-4763","978-1-4244-4498-4","978-1-4244-4499-1","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977","","Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools","data handling;security of data","SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation","","1","","25","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns. Finally the experimental results show that this approach is feasible.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945304","alert correlation;attack scenario;causal knowledge;data mining","Correlation;Cyberspace;Data mining;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Markov processes;Sensors","Markov processes;data mining;matrix algebra;probability;security of data","APT detection;CEP;Markov property;advanced persistent threat detection;alert correlation analysis;attack scenarios;causal knowledge discovery;complex event processing;cyberspace security situation awareness;data mining;multistep attack processes;one step transition probability matrix;raw alert stream","","0","","21","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
