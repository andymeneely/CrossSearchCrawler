Proceedings. 22nd International Symposium on","20031020","2003","","","260","269","A large class of security attacks exploit software implementation vulnerabilities such as unchecked buffers. This paper proposes transparent runtime randomization (TRR), a generalized approach for protecting against a wide range of security attacks. TRR dynamically and randomly relocates a program's stack, heap, shared libraries, and parts of its runtime control data structures inside the application memory address space. Making a program's memory layout different each time it runs foils the attacker's assumptions about the memory layout of the vulnerable program and makes the determination of critical address values difficult if not impossible. TRR is implemented by changing the Linux dynamic program loader, hence it is transparent to applications. We demonstrate that TRR is effective in defeating real security attacks, including malloc-based heap overflow, integer overflow, and double-free attacks, for which effective prevention mechanisms are yet to emerge. Furthermore, TRR incurs less than 9% program startup overhead and no runtime overhead.","1060-9857","0-7695-1955-5","","10.1109/RELDIS.2003.1238076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238076","","Buffer overflow;Computer bugs;Computer crime;Data security;Information security;Invasive software;Linux;Operating systems;Protection;Runtime","Unix;safety-critical software","TRR;application memory address space;attack prevention;dynamic program loader;security attacks;software implementation vulnerabilities;transparent runtime randomization","","27","1","26","","","6-18 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we have revealed that the whole data mining process forms a part of strategic analysis phase of strategic management. We have mapped the data mining activities to the strategic analysis phase from both the conceptual as well as the practical perspectives. We have found that if data mining is used for conducting environmental analysis, much better results could be yielded by helping the managers to formulate target-oriented strategies more efficiently and effectively.

In this paper, we present a method based on semi-supervised learning to process the massive data in the high-speed network.

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200","Data leak;collection intersection;network security;privacy","Data models;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols;Security","Internet;computer network security;data privacy","DLD;Internet service provider;add-on service;data leak detection;privacy preserving detection;sensitive data exposure","","0","","56","","2015-02-10","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Resiliency is the ability to provide alternative communication paths should one path become disrupted due to failures or attacks; while security is the ability to contain and limit the impact of compromises. Interestingly, these two can present conflicting demands. We provide a first formulation of a new class of problems focusing on the engineering of attack-resistant networks. Our model considers both resiliency and security, and uses a notion of blocking probability as a rigorous measure for evaluating different network constructions. We propose several efficient approximation algorithms for computing blocking probability and provide bounds for their errors. Based on these algorithms, we introduce a family of heuristics to guide the construction of optimal attack-resistant networks with minimum blocking probabilities. We also present extensive results to evaluate and demonstrate the near-optimal performance of our heuristics and approximation algorithms.","1092-1648","0-7695-2161-4","","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348112","","Approximation algorithms;Computer crime;Filtering;Heuristic algorithms;Internet;Multiprocessor interconnection networks;Network servers;Resists;Routing protocols;Security","Internet;probability;telecommunication security","Internet;attack-resistant network;computing blocking probability;purpose-built network;security model","","5","","13","","","5-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In ADD, the secondary qualities are satisfied within the constraints of achieving the most important ones. In this paper, we detail the design of our system's machine learning (ML) component using ADD. Tactics and primitives to achieve system qualities (i.e. performance, security, availability, modifiability, and usability) are essayed in this paper. The ML component of our system is responsible for (1) determining the appropriate media and modalities based on user context, (2) finding the replacement to a failed/missing device or modality, and (3) providing the context suitability of newly-added media or modality. The ML component's knowledge acquisition is incremental; it keeps its previously-earned knowledge in its knowledge database (KD) and appends newly-acquired ones onto it. The ML component makes the system intelligent, adaptive and fault-tolerant.

The objective is to improve the competence of intrusion classification with a significantly reduced set of input features from the training data. In supervised learning, feature selection is the process of selecting the important input training features and removing the irrelevant input training features, with the objective of obtaining a feature subset that produces higher classification accuracy.

If the critical components are isolated in VMs,access control can be enforced or attestation can be made when the subject is accessing via VMs. In this way, VMs can improve the security level of critical components such as OS, kernel, data, and applications.

Such behaviour, known as packet dropping, results of nodespsila selfishness or maliciousness and has dramatic effects on networks performances. Most of proposed solutions to counter packet dropping are either based on trust management or multipath routing, but no solution combines both trust management and multipath routing. Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a security framework which adapts security to the application requirements; evaluates trustworthy relationship based on localized trust model and efficiently combines multipath routing into trust management. In this paper we study ASMA performance against the most classical and simple packet dropping attack: Black Hole attack. Aiming to evaluate ASMA in dense networks, we use a realistic scenario representing a subway environment which brings interesting features and may be a prolific context for MANET application development. Through simulations we compare the performances of DSR and ASMA associated to DSR in attacked pure MANETs. Simulation results illustrate that ASMA-DSR outperforms DSR under different attack configurations and is totally adapted for dense and large networks.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-2702-4","978-1-4244-2703-1","10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625667","","Authentication;Collaboration;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Performance analysis;Robustness;Routing protocols;Security;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunications","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","ASMA performances;adaptive secured multipath;black hole attack;dense networks;forward packets;localized trust model;mobile ad hoc networks;multihop transmissions;multipath routing;nodes collaboration;packet dropping;packet dropping attacks;route packets;trust management","","0","","11","","","6-9 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20090605","2009","","","540","545","Traditionally, network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS) monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activities. However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection. Our experiments show that the probability of a successful evasion is low, at about 0.98% in the worst case. We implement our approach in a prototype and present some preliminary results. Overall, the proposed approach is able to consistently detect intrusions and does not introduce any additional false positives.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066523","encrypted network;intrusion detection;malicious proxy;secret-sharing","Availability;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","cryptography;probability;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","NIDS;Shamir's secret-sharing scheme;VPN;encrypted network traffic;malicious activity detection;network-based intrusion detection system;probability;virtual private network","","1","","10","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a hierarchical, autonomous, and forecasting cloud based IDS (HAF-CIDS) that continuously monitors and analyzes system events and computes the risk level. The proposed system improves the detection accuracy through the integration with a forecasting engine that runs the Holt-Winters (HW) algorithm.

Currently, packet analysis is provided by many ISPs but it has a high impact in term of performance and energy consumption, this makes the choice of the optimal IDS strategy both quite complex and a key issue. To this aim, IDS strategies have been deeply investigated in term of performance, however, the assessment of the energy consumption is generally unexplored.

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm.

IEEE 34th Conference on","20091218","2009","","","899","906","Packet classification is one of the crucial components of application such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.","","978-1-4244-4488-5","978-1-4244-4487-8","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038","","Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats","","0","","23","","","20-23 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wireless and distributed nature of MANETs poses a great challenge to system security designers. Ad hoc networks are by nature very open to anyone. Their biggest advantage is also one of their biggest disadvantages: Anyone with the proper hardware and knowledge of the network topology and protocols can connect to the network. This allows potential attackers to infiltrate the network and carry out attacks on its participants with the purpose of stealing or altering information. A specific type of attack, the Wormhole attack does not require exploiting any nodes in the network and can interfere with the route establishment process. The entire routing system in MANET can even be brought down using the wormhole attack.

This paper proposes a scheme to classify a person's movement as intrusive or non-intrusive in a semantic way. The classification is aided with the help of sensor network. The sensor network is considered to be heterogeneous. It uses a PIR sensor for movement detection, an RFID sensor for identifying the person and an image sensor for verification. This system uses both wired and wireless networks for efficient data transfer. Data from either networks are synchronised using time and location information. The proposed Intruder Detection System identifies a person as an intruder, if there is any mismatch in the sensed information.","","978-1-61284-261-5","","10.1109/ICOAC.2010.5725357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5725357","Closed Circuit Television (CCTV);Intrusion Detection;Passive Infrared (PIR);Surveillance System;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)","Cameras;Databases;Radiofrequency identification;Semantics;Servers;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","closed circuit television;computer network security;image classification;image motion analysis;image sensors;image sequences;radiofrequency identification;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","CCTV;PIR sensor;RFID sensor;closed circuit television;data transfer;human intervention;image sensor;movement detection;passive infrared;semantic intruder detection system;surveillance system;wireless sensor network","","1","","9","","","14-16 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the security of guest virtual machines and of the applications and services they host can be improved by leveraging the additional architectural layer introduced by such a technology. This paper discusses security management for virtualized environments and provides several contributions. First, a novel architecture (Kvm-SMA) with the following features is detailed: it can protect guest integrity from both remote and local attacks such as root-kits, viruses, and worms; it is not circumventable and it is completely transparent to guest machines; it can asynchronously analyze guest data and monitor guest system behavior. Second, the proposed architecture has been implemented entirely on open source software and can be replicated to both Linux and Windows guests. Third the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture is shown. The former is proved showing the results of root-kit detection test, while the latter is supported by standard performance tests showing that the introduced overhead is small. Finally, a distinguishing feature of our monitoring system proposal is that it is immune to timing attacks: that is, an adversary cannot notice the monitoring system is active by analyzing the time required to perform system calls. We believe that security management of both single virtualized hosts and distributed virtualized systems can benefit from our proposal.","","978-1-4244-7547-6","","10.1109/CIT.2010.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578474","Malware;Security;Virtualization technology","Computer architecture;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","Kvm-SMA;distributed virtualized system;kernel virtual machine;root-kit detection test;security management architecture","","1","","15","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a differentiated service protection framework consisting of anomaly traffic detection and resource management. Data mining based anomaly traffic detection is implemented at the host; whereas resource management is responsible for the allocation of network resources to the applications. Based on the deviation of the monitored traffic to the normal traffic, differentiated resources are allocated to the traffic. When suspicious traffic is detected, multimedia transmission reacts proactively via adjusting the transmission rate, which can avoid possible packet loss resulting from DoS bandwidth consumption, and thus provide better QoS. The impact of the traffic anomalies on the legitimate services can be mitigated, and the legitimate services can be protected. Simulation results show that better PSNR can be achieved for multimedia transmission during an attack in our proposed framework.","","1-4244-1016-9","1-4244-1017-7","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284956","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Data mining;Degradation;Protection;Quality of service;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services","DiffServ networks;data mining;multimedia communication;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet multimedia transmission;anomaly traffic detection;data mining;denial-of-service attacks;differentiated resource allocation;differentiated service protection;multimedia service;network resource allocation;quality of service;resource management;suspicious traffic detection","","0","","9","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We implemented the proposed IDS in MATLAB version R2013a on a Windows PC having 3.20 GHz CPU and 4GB RAM. The experiments and evaluations of proposed method were performed with Corrected KDD cup 99 intrusion detection dataset and we used sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as the evaluation metrics. We attained detection accuracy of about 99.66% for DOS attacks, 98.55% for PROBE, 98.99% for R2L and 98.81% for U2R attacks.

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.","","0-7695-2108-8","","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286430","","Communication system security;Computer displays;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protection","computer networks;cryptography;data communication;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;pattern matching;protocols;system monitoring","ProtoMon;anomaly-based detection;application-level protocols;attack detection;attack signatures;cryptographic protocol intrusion detection;encrypted sessions;information protection;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention;machine learning;monitoring process;normal system behavior;pattern matching;profile creation;protocol misuse;protocol response modification;signature-based detection;unauthorized access;unauthorized manipulation","","5","1","28","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is very central to ensure the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, reliability of these detectors and to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems are basic information related to TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11 specific attacks such as de-authentication attack or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11 specific intrusions. Our model of feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a mean to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm.","","978-1-4244-1751-3","978-1-4244-1752-0","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530270","Feature Selection;Information Gain Ratio;Intrusion Detection Systems;K-means;Wireless Networks","Accuracy;Degradation;Detectors;Face detection;Filters;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Protocols;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","access protocols;feature extraction;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;MAC layer;TCP/IP header;feature selection;illegal penetration;intrusion detection system;k-means classifier","","2","","15","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks. The empirical results demonstrate that dual-variant execution has on average 17 percent performance overhead when deployed on multicore processors.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714703","Intrusion detection;multivariant execution;n-variant execution;system call.","Kernel;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Security;Synchronization;Writing","computer crime;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","asynchronous signal;attack detection;code injection attack;computer systems attack;dual variant execution;false alarm;intrusion detection system;monitoring mechanism;multicore processor;multiprocess application;multithreaded application;multivariant execution technique;replicated execution","","5","1","45","","2011-02-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Towards a unified approach to the representation of, and reasoning with, probabilistic risk information about software and its system interface","Feather, M.S.","Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Technol., Pasadena, CA, USA","Software Reliability Engineering, 2004. ISSRE 2004. 15th International Symposium on","20050124","2004","","","391","402","Early risk assessment is key in planning the development of systems, including systems that involve software. Such risk assessment needs a combination of the following elements; 1) Severity estimates for the potential effects of failures, and likelihood estimates for their causes; 2) Fault trees that link causes to failures; 3) Efficacy estimates of design and process steps towards reducing risk; 4) Distinctions between preventing, alleviating and detecting (thereafter removing), risks; 5) Risk preventions that have potential side effects of themselves introducing risks. The paper shows a unified approach that accommodates all these elements. The approach combines fault trees (from probabilistic risk assessment methods) with explicit treatment of risk mitigations (a generalization of the notion of a ""detection"" seen in FMECA analyses). Fault trees capture the causal relationships by which failure mechanisms may combine to lead to failure modes. Risk mitigations encompass (and distinguish among) options to prevent risks, detect risks, and alleviate risks (i.e., decrease their impact should they occur). This approach has been embodied in extensions to a JPL-developed risk assessment tool, and is illustrated here on software risk assessment information drawn from an actual project's software system FMECA (failure modes, effects and criticality analysis). Since its elements are typical of risk assessment of software and its system interface, the findings should be relevant to a wide range of software systems.","1071-9458","0-7695-2215-7","","10.1109/ISSRE.2004.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383134","Cost-benefit tradeoffs;FMEA;FMECA;FTA;Failure Modes;PRA;Probabilistic Risk Reduction;Risk-informed decision-making;SFMECA","Application software;Costs;Failure analysis;Fault detection;Fault trees;Protection;Risk analysis;Risk management;Software systems;Space vehicles","decision making;fault trees;maximum likelihood estimation;risk management;software development management","FTA;PRA;SFMECA;cost-benefit tradeoffs;failure modes;fault trees;probabilistic risk reduction;risk assessment;risk-informed decision-making;system interface","","7","","20","","","2-5 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Joint Conference on","20061030","2006","","","2354","2361","Most of the currently available network security techniques are not able to cope with the dynamic and increasingly complex nature of the attacks on distributed computer systems. An automated and adaptive defensive tool is imperative for computer networks. One of the emerging solutions for Network Security is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However, this technology still faces some challenges such as low detection rates, high false alarm rates and requirement of heavy computational power. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes an innovative Machine Learning algorithm called Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) which utilizes semi-parametric learning model and Adaptive boosting techniques to reduce learning bias and generalization variance in difficult classification. In this paper, BMPNN is implemented as a classifier to detect different types of network anomalies in the KDD-99 benchmark. Extensive experimental outcome indicates that the proposed BMPNN outperforms other state-of-the-art learning algorithms in terms of detection accuracy and model robustness at an affordable computational cost.","","0-7803-9490-9","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716408","Artificial Neural Network;Generalization Variance;Learning Bias;Network Intrusion Detection","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Power system modeling;Power system security","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;telecommunication security","adaptive boosting techniques;boosted modified probabilistic neural network;computer networks;distributed computer systems;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection;network security techniques;semiparametric learning model","","1","","26","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In most cases, depending upon the actual security device defending the network, there are typically multiple fragmentation techniques and packet size combinations capable of squeezing and exploiting protection device on a network.

Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters. We also show that Swift can harness the processing power of hardware SIMD instructions by virtue of its SIMD-capable instruction set.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2111381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719540","Linux kernel networking;packet filter","Band pass filters;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Protocols;Security","information filters;information networks;instruction sets;parallel processing","BSD packet filter;Linux;complex instruction set computer;fast dynamic packet filter;high performance packet;high speed packet processing;instruction set architecture;multiple machines;single instruction multiple data","","0","","29","","2011-02-24","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This methodology introduces four parameters, Possibility, Cost, Profit, and Damage to delineate any assumed attack or threat. By studying these parameters together, it becomes clear what are the most probable and considerable misbehaviors, how much damage they can make, what are profits and cost of such a behavior for the hostile host, and so how much essential is to tackle it. Comparison of PCPD parameters for different types of misbehavior results in a comprehensible identification of their severity, network's reliability, and network's weak points.

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.","","978-1-4577-0458-1","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956","anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis","Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training","security of data","file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits","","2","","24","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose pairwise distance based matching algorithm (PDM) to eliminate long edges by pairwise exchanges between matching pairs. Our sequence dispatch algorithm (SQD) iteratively finds the closest event-robot pair, includes the event in dispatch schedule of the selected robot and updates its position accordingly. When event-robot distances are multiplied by robot resistance (inverse of the remaining energy), the corresponding energy-balanced variants are obtained. We also present generalizations which handle multiple visits and timing constraints.

The experiment results show that the presented incremental clustering algorithm for intrusion detection can achieve high detection rate and low false positive rate.","","978-0-7695-3490-9","","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756576","Clonal Selection;Clustering;Incremental Algorithm;Intrusion Detection","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer industry;Conferences;Data analysis;Electronics industry;Industrial electronics;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms","pattern clustering;security of data","clonal selection;clustering analysis;computing cluster radius method;incremental clustering algorithm;intrusion detection","","1","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system adopts new analysis schemes to aim to reduce the relativity of each ISM component as far as possible and avoid the single point failure caused by the single central analyzer. Compared with traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs), this system is a more adaptive and efficient system. It enables member sites of ISM components in the same trust community or different ones to forewarn attacks cooperatively, and possesses higher detection rate, load balancing and better self-adaptability.

A secure networked predictive control system (SNPCS) architecture is presented, which integrates the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, Message Digest (MD5) algorithm, timestamp strategy, and recursive networked predictive control (RNPC) method. The former three parts are used to form a secure transmission mechanism between the controller side and the plant side, which is responsible for enforcing the data confidentiality and checking the data integrity and authenticity. To guarantee the control system performance when suffering from deception attacks, the RNPC method based on round-trip time delays is proposed to compensate for the adverse effects introduced by the deception attacks as well as the network communication constraints, such as time-varying network delay, packet disorder and packet dropout. A theoretical result using the switched system theory is obtained for the closed-loop stability of the RNPC system. Practical experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SNPCS.","1063-6536","","","10.1109/TCST.2011.2160543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5961659","Communication constraints;data confidentiality;deception attacks;experiments;recursive networked predictive control (RNPC);secure networked control systems (SNCSs);stability","Actuators;Delay;Encryption;Predictive control;Receivers","closed loop systems;cryptography;data communication;data integrity;delays;networked control systems;predictive control","DES algorithm;MD5 algorithm;closed-loop stability;data authenticity;data confidentiality;data encryption standard;data integrity;data transmission security;deception attacks;message digest algorithm;networked control systems;recursive networked predictive control;round-trip time delays;secure networked predictive control systems;switched system theory;timestamp strategy","","10","","33","","2011-07-25","Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To achieve this goal each of the stored signatures represents a description of an attack or an undesired event in the monitored network. The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures. This paper presents a method which uses the Cell architecture to run an adapted speculative parallel pattern matching algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the advantages brought by our of our approach are significant compared to the serial implementation and other parallel ones. We also emphasize the advantages brought by the characteristics of the Cell architecture.","","978-1-61284-709-2","978-0-7695-4373-4","10.1109/CISIS.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5989048","cell architecture;dfa matching;intrusion detection;parallel algorithm","Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Intrusion detection;Microprocessors;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Program processors","digital signatures;pattern matching;security of data;software architecture","cell architecture;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;parallel pattern matching algorithm;regular expression matching;signature matching algorithms;using cell processors","","0","","14","","","June 30 2011-July 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrary to other adopted methods, the proposed approach does not rely on symptoms of infection to detect compromised machines. This allows the inference of malware infection at very early stages of contamination. The approach aims at detecting whether the machines are infected or not as well as pinpointing the exact malware type/family, if the machines were found to be compromised. The latter insights allow network security operators of diverse organizations, Internet service providers and backbone networks to promptly detect their clients' compromised machines in addition to effectively providing them with tailored anti-malware/patch solutions. To achieve the intended goals, the proposed approach exploits the darknet Internet space and employs statistical methods to infer large-scale probing activities. Subsequently, such activities are correlated with malware samples by leveraging fuzzy hashing and entropy based techniques. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using 60 GB of real darknet traffic and 65 thousand real malware samples. The results concur that the rationale of exploiting probing activities for worldwide early malware infection detection is indeed very promising. Further, the results demonstrate that the extracted inferences exhibit noteworthy accuracy and can generate significant cyber security insights that could be used for effective mitigation.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883391","","Correlation;Entropy;Internet;Malware;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;computer network security;cryptography;entropy;fuzzy reasoning;invasive software","Internet scale infections;darknet Internet;entropy based techniques;fuzzy hashing;inference;malware infection detection;network security operators;probing activities","","0","","27","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
