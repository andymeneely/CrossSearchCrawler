Such information can be used to verify web alerts generated by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Web Intrusion Detection Systems (Web IDSs). In this paper, we propose a method to verify web alerts generated by mentioned sensors. The goal of the alert verification component is to eliminate or tag alerts that do not represent successful attacks. Our approach is based on analyzing HTTP Transaction metadata, including Request method, Request Headers, Status Code, and Response Headers. We implemented an alert verification module, reconfigured ModSecurity, modified a subset of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and developed knowledge-base of web attack vectors to evaluate our method. We show that our approach significantly reduces false and non-relevant alerts with quite low processing overhead, thus enhances the quality of the results.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994044","HTTP Protocol;Intrusion Detection System;Web Application Firewall;alert verification;web attack","Accuracy;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Protocols;Web servers","Internet;computer network security;hypermedia;meta data;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;HTTP transaction metadata analysis;OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set;WAF;Web IDS;Web application firewalls;Web attack;Web attack vector knowledge-base;Web driven alert verification;Web intrusion detection systems;Web server;alert verification module;reconfigured ModSecurity;request headers;request method;status code","","0","","20","","","3-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this issue, we propose Advance Oblivious comparison and VGuard, a framework that allows a Client and Server to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy. An efficient protocol, called Xhash, for Advance Oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of Guard is to first convert a firewall policy to non-overlapping numerical rules and then uses Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. After then datas were transferred from vpn server to home network.","","978-1-4673-0213-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215614","Network Security;Privacy;Virtual Private Networks","Artificial neural networks;Fires;Security;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;home networks;protocols;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","VGuard;VPN server;VPN technology;VPN tunnel;Xhash protocol;advance oblivious comparison;client;encrypted tunnel;firewall policy;home network;remote network;roaming user;security threat;traffic;virtual private network","","0","","10","","","30-31 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An integer program for Open Locating Dominating sets and its results on the hexagon-triangle infinite grid and other graphs","Sweigart, D.B.; Presnell, J.; Kincaid, R.","","Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS), 2014","20140612","2014","","","29","32","This paper presents an integer linear program (ILP) for the identification of Open Locating Dominating Sets (OLD) of minimum cardinality and presents several results of the ILP on various graphs. The OLD is similar to an identifying code, but for an open neighborhood instead of closed. The OLD was introduced by Peter Slater and Suk J. Seo in 2010 as a method by which one could identify the location of an event at a node where a node in the set can detect events at adjacent nodes, but cannot detect an event at itself. This is perhaps more clear as a series of factories such that those with intrusion detection devices form an identifying code, but an intruder will disable the system at the factory into which she breaks, if so equipped. There are also applications in other areas such as router networks. This paper continues work by Alison Oldham at the College of William and Mary on the development and implementation of an ILP to identify such OLDs on finite graphs. We demonstrate and compare the results on 100 node randomly generated graphs of various constructions; Erdös-Renyi, Geometric and Scale-Free. We find that most graphs have a density near 1/3. We also explore the use of the ILP to generate OLDs for infinite grids, looking specifically at the hexagonal-triangular grid where we discover a new upper bound of 5/12 on the minimum density OLD for this grid. Finally, we extend this ILP to identify locating dominating sets that simultaneously satisfy open and closed neighborhood criteria, or Closed-Open Locating Dominating sets (COLD).","","978-1-4799-4837-6","","10.1109/SIEDS.2014.6829887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829887","Closed-Open Locating Dominating Set;Integer Linear Program;Open Locating Dominating Set","Contamination;Diseases;Educational institutions;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Production facilities;Upper bound","graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;set theory","ILP;closed-open locating dominating sets;finite graphs;hexagon-triangle infinite grid;integer linear program;integer program;intrusion detection devices","","0","","4","","","25-25 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These types of WSN rely on cluster heads for data aggregation and transmission towards sink node. Subsequently cluster head nodes are outfitted with high energy. Conventional hierarchical routing protocols were not created considering security; they are helpless against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed. Among the various Denial of Service attacks, Flooding attacks consumes the maximum battery life of the sensor node, on the other hand Gray hole attack consumes the minimum battery life of the nodes. Thus based on energy these attacks are distinguished and isolated from the network using the proposed IDS and extensive simulations are carried out using NS2- MANNASIM framework.","","978-1-4799-9854-8","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225410","Cluster head;DoS;Flooding attack;Gray hole attack;Hierarchical routing;IDS","Computer crime;Delays;Energy consumption;Floods;Intrusion detection;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attacks;NS2-MANNASIM framework;cluster head nodes;data aggregation;data transmission;denial of service attacks;detection complexity;distributed flooding detection;distributed intrusion detection scheme;energy savings;gray hole attacks;hierarchical routing protocols;information supply process;sink node;wireless sensor network","","0","","10","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS. These simulations will quantify network throughput and device battery usage in large scale network deployments that are, and are not, using B-SIPS.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3450-3","","10.1109/HICSS.2009.394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755621","","Batteries;Bluetooth;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection;Research initiatives;Sensor systems;Testing;Throughput","Bluetooth;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Battery-Sensing Intrusion Protection System research;Bluetooth;Wi-Fi;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;device battery usage;mobile devices;multi-vector attacks;network deployment validation;network simulations;network throughput;saturated network environment;throughput degradation;transmission rate","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To tackle this problem, we propose genetic algorithms (GAs) based clustering method, which dynamically adjusts the fuzzy sets to provide maximum profit based on minimum support and confidence specified as linguistic terms. This is achieved by tuning the base values of the membership functions for each quantitative attribute in a way that maximizes the number of large itemsets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in this direction.

Using the multiresolution property of wavelet transforms, we can effectively identify arbitrarily shaped clusters at different scales and degrees of detail, moreover, applying wavelet transform removes the noise from the original feature space and make more accurate cluster found. Experimental results on KDD-99 intrusion detection dataset show the efficiency and accuracy of this algorithm. A detection rate above 96% and a false alarm rate below 3% are achieved.

We envision a new generation of IDSs defined by a set of services supporting security managers in improving the overall network security. Specifically, we show how to model the ID processes as a set of plans that a security manager may go through on a network of cooperative nodes interacting with one another in order to offer or to ask for services. Services correspond to specialized ID tasks and encapsulate problem solving and simulation capabilities. Complex ID activities are expressed by workflows, the focus being on flexibility, reuse and interoperability of ID services.

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Centroid-Based Nearest Neighbor Feature Representation for E-Government Intrusion Detection","Chih-Fong Tsai; Jung-Hsiang Tsai; Jui-Sheng Chou","Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat.

The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.","","978-1-4577-1459-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432","","Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training","Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing","CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs","","1","","18","","","5-6 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While popular systems like Snort are used in many network locations, comprehensive deployment across Tier-1 service provider networks is costly due to the need for high-speed monitors at many network ingress points. Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow- alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof- of-concept. We evaluate prediction accuracy of candidate ML algorithms on actual packet traces. The duration of prediction effectiveness is an issue for ML approaches and more so in resource intensive network applications.

Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection.

Due to these particularities, classical routing protocols cannot be used and some specific ones have been proposed. Because routing process is fundamental in a MANET deployment, it constitutes a privileged target of attackers. In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2013.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258","Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security","Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols","","1","","9","","","2-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The general idea in this paper is to introduce collaboration achieved by taking advantage of various kinds of contextual information and thus enable IDS to correctly identify successful attacks while simultaneously reducing the number of false positives. In this paper, a multilevel event correlation structure is proposed by firstly assigning each alert a value of confidence using contextual information and then correlates the preprocessed alerts based on improved temporal causal correlation combining with confidence value. At the end, a scenario graph and a high-level alert with final confidence are presented, which indicates the reliability of attacks launched through specific path.

The performance of multi-path routing under wormhole attack is studied in both cluster and uniform network topologies. Because multi-path routing is vulnerable to wormhole attacks, a scheme called statistical analysis of multi-path (SAM) is proposed to detect such attacks and to identify malicious nodes. As the name suggests, SAM detects wormhole attacks and identifies attackers by statistically analyzing the information collected by multi-path routing. Neither additional security services or systems nor security enhancement of routing protocols is needed in the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that SAM successfully detects wormhole attacks and locates the malicious nodes in networks with cluster and uniform topologies and with different node transmission range.","1525-3511","0-7803-8966-2","","10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424843","","Ad hoc networks;Delay;Electronic mail;Information analysis;Information security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","cluster network topology;multi-path routing;node transmission range;routing protocols;statistical analysis;uniform network topology;wireless ad hoc networks;wormhole attack detection;wormhole attack location","","17","","16","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead. What's more, in the case of crash occurrence, the ATEP scheme is still able to maintain rather steady throughput without sudden decrease.","","978-1-4244-7422-6","978-1-4244-7421-9","10.1109/SNPD.2010.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521501","ATEP;controllability;crash detection;flow-driven;quick crash recovery","Artificial intelligence;Computer crashes;Controllability;Intrusion detection;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Throughput;Vehicle crash testing;Yarn","security of data","active two-threshold scheme;data preserving overhead;flow-level controllability;ideal exit-point;network intrusion detection system;packet loss;packet-driven NIDS;packet-driven systems;quick crash recovery mechanism;software crashes","","1","","14","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine. In this paper we propose a new Real Time Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection System (RTUNIDS) which monitor network flows in two windows with different sizes and detects network attacks by correlating outliers from multiple clusters. The proposed solution has the ability of detecting different types of intrusions in realtime such as DOS, DDOS, scanning, distribution of worms and any other network attacks which produce huge amount of network traffic and in the meanwhile it detects Bot-Master if the detected attack lunched by Bots.","","978-1-4673-5137-9","","10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747642","","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","Bot-Master detection;DDOS;NIDS solutions;RTU-NIDS;attack-free dataset;byte monitoring;engine training;misuse detection mechanism;network behavior matching;network flow monitoring;network traffic;packet payload monitoring;predefined attack signatures;real time multistage unsupervised intelligent engine;real time unsupervised network intrusion detection system;scanning;semisupervised anomaly detection systems;unknown attack detection rate enhancement;worm distribution;zero day attacks","","0","","27","","","23-25 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents Bezoar, an automated full-system virtual machine-based approach to recover from zero-day control-flow hijacking attacks. Bezoar tracks down the source of network bytes in the system and after an attack, replays the checkpointed run while ignoring inputs from the malicious source. We evaluated our proof-of-concept prototype on six notorious exploits for Linux and Windows. In all cases, it recovered the full system state and resumed execution.

However, in the presence of attackers, reliable and trustworthy operations in such networks become impossible without securing routing protocols. In this paper, we target to study and design a secure routing protocol S-GyTAR for vehicular environments. Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator. Simulation results show high performances regarding the detection rate of malicious nodes and overhead with an amelioration of the end-to-end communication delay in the presence of malicious vehicles.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036788","Clustering;Monitoring;Reputation;Routing;Security;VANET","Ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Roads;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","routing protocols;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","NS3 simulator;S-GyTAR;VANET;data collection;data routing;distributed trust management strategy;greedy forwarding technique;secure intersection-based routing protocol;urban vehicular networks","","0","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host. An admin version of Collabra exists on a privileged domain in the VM network to perform filtering of malicious add-ons to hyper-calls at the guest OS level itself before routing the call to the VMM.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945321","cloud computing;distributed intrusion detection system;hyper-call;intrusion detection architecture;virtual machine","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Driver circuits;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors","application program interfaces;cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtual private networks","Collabra;Xen hypervisor based collaborative intrusion detection system;abstraction layer;cloud security;distributed intrusion detection platform;filtering layer;guest operating system;hyper-call API;hyper-call interface;malicious add-ons filtering;virtual machine monitor;virtualized network","","10","","24","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our model builds upon and adds to existing models and solutions including network monitoring for Infrastructure as a Service and snapshot capabilities to provide forensic evidence.

We present a lightweight distributed and parallel security log analysis framework that allows organizations to analyze a massive number of system, network, and transaction logs efficiently and scalably. Different from the general distributed frameworks, e.g., MapReduce, our framework is specifically designed for security log analysis. It features a minimum set of necessary properties, such as dynamic task scheduling for streaming logs. For prototyping, we implement our framework in Amazon cloud environments (EC2 and S3) with a basic analysis application.

The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network.

Our proposal combines the characteristics of data mining techniques with a continuous stream of input data, and with high processing performance GPU architecture. Results show that our approach provides accuracy comparable to or better than existing related work (e.g., above 95%) while ramping up performance (e.g., up to 62x speed up), comparing the different implementations of our approach.

A formal model for an agent for masquerade detection is then derived which discerns the static attributes of the user as well as detects anomalies in the dynamic user behavior via a statistical classifier.

But network intrusions are now becoming more and more sophisticated to detect, thus, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) have been proposed which enables an IDS to collect information and learn experience from other IDS nodes. By maintaining interactions among a set of IDS nodes, a CIDN is expected to be more powerful in detecting some complicated attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) than a single IDS. In real deployment, we identify that each IDS may have different levels of sensitivity in detecting different types of intrusions (i.e., based on their own signatures and settings). In this paper, we therefore define a notion of intrusion sensitivity and investigate the feasibility of using it to evaluate the trustworthiness of an IDS node. In addition, we describe several challenges when using this notion in practice. In the evaluation, the experimental results indicate that the use of intrusion sensitivity is feasible and encouraging to enhance the accuracy of detecting malicious nodes.","","978-1-4799-2548-3","","10.1109/CIS.2013.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746483","Collaborative Intrusion Detection Network;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Sensitivity;Trust Management","Accuracy;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Robustness;Sensitivity","computer crime;groupware;trusted computing","CIDN;DoS attack;IDS nodes;attacks identification;collaborative intrusion detection networks;denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection systems;intrusion sensitivity;malicious nodes detection;trust evaluation;trustworthiness","","0","","24","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However according to the Verizon 2014 Data Breach Report: “after analysing 10 years of data... organizations cannot keep up with cyber crime-and the bad guys are winning.” Although billions are expended worldwide on cyber security, organizations struggle with complexity, e.g., the NISTIR 7628 guidelines for cyber-physical systems are over 600 pages of text. And there is a lack of information visibility. Organizations must bridge the gap between technical cyber operations and the business/social priorities since both sides are essential for ensuring cyber security. Identifying visual structures for information synthesis could help reduce the complexity while increasing information visibility within organizations. This paper lays the foundation for investigating such visual structures by first identifying where current visual structures are succeeding or failing. To do this, we examined publicly available analyses related to three types of security issues: 1) epidemic, 2) cyber attacks on an industrial network, and 3) threat of terrorist attack. We found that existing visual structures are largely inadequate for reducing complexity and improving information visibility. However, based on our analysis, we identified a range of different visual structures, and their possible trade-offs/limitation is framing strategies for cyber policy. These structures form the basis of evolving visualization to support information synthesis for policy actions, which has rarely been done but is promising based on the efficacy of existing visualizations for cyber incident detection, attacks, and situation awareness.","2325-5366","978-9-9499-5442-1","","10.1109/CYCON.2015.7158474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158474","cyber security policy;human-computer interaction;organizations;visual structures;visualization","Complexity theory;Computer security;Data visualization;Organizations;Terrorism;Visualization","data visualisation;security of data;terrorism","Verizon 2014 Data Breach Report;cyber attacks;cyber incident detection;cyber policy strategies;cyber security;information synthesis;information visibility;situation awareness;terrorist attack;visual structures","","0","","19","","","26-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed IDS considers two types of sink mobility: periodic and random. In addition, as the cell leaders do not activate their IDS agent simultaneously, the additional energy consumption incurred by the IDS is low.

Specifically, computer network security is concerned with preventing the intrusion of an unauthorized person into a network of computers. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a tool to monitor the network traffic and users activity with the aim of distinguishing between hostile and non-hostile traffic. Most of current networks implement Misuse detection or Anomaly detection techniques for Intrusion detection. By deploying misuse based IDS it cannot detect unknown intrusions and anomaly based IDS have high false positive rate for detection. To overcome this, proposed system uses combination of both network based and host based IDPS as Hybrid Intrusion Detection and Prevention System which will be helpful for detecting maximum attacks on networks.","","978-1-4799-9854-8","","10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225396","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225396","anomaly based;attacks;classification;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;misuse based","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computers;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IDS;IMMIX-intrusion detection system;IMMIX-intrusion prevention system;anomaly detection;computer network security;misuse detection;non-hostile traffic","","0","","12","","","6-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the routing aspects of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are already well understood, the research activities about security in MANETs are still at their beginning. MANETs pose a number of new security problems in addition to the problems of regular networks. In addition to the classical security threats we identified additional ways how nodes may attack security in an ad hoc network. We explore several aspects of possible (mis)behaviour of MANET participants. We introduce a systematology of attacks on a MANET. Further, we describe the results of simulations that show, how misbehaving nodes affect MANETs based on the DSR routing protocol.

However, when an IM is fed by a frequency converter, the spectral analysis of stator current signal becomes difficult. For this reason, the monitoring must depend on multiple signatures in order to reduce the effect of harmonic disturbance on the motor-phase current. The aim of this paper is the description of a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis of IMs using signal-based method. It is based on signal processing and an unsupervised classification technique called the artificial ant clustering. The proposed approach is tested on a squirrel-cage IM of 5.5 kW in order to detect broken rotor bars and bearing failure at different load levels. The experimental results prove the efficiency of our approach compared with supervised classification methods in condition monitoring of electrical machines.","0278-0046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2230598","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365312","Artificial intelligence;fault detection;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;induction motors (IMs);monitoring;motor-current signal analysis;pattern recognition (PR);signal processing;squirrel-cage motors","Fault detection;Feature extraction;Harmonic analysis;Induction motors;Pattern recognition;Stators;Vectors","artificial intelligence;condition monitoring;failure analysis;fault diagnosis;machine bearings;pattern clustering;power engineering computing;squirrel cage motors","artificial ant clustering;bearing failure;broken rotor bar detection;condition monitoring;electrical fault;electrical machines;fault detection-diagnosis;frequency converter;harmonic disturbance;improved artificial ant clustering technique;induction motor;mechanical fault;motor-phase current;power 5.5 kW;signal processing;signal-based method;squirrel-cage IM;stator current signal spectrum analysis;unsupervised classification technique","","30","","57","","2012-11-29","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thereafter, we propose a family of algorithms that approximate the optimal solution, and prove that some of these algorithms have guaranteeable approximation ratios. The algorithms that have analytically guaranteeable performance require re-computation every time the topology changes due to mobility. We next modify the computation strategy so as to seamlessly adapt to topological changes due to mobility.
