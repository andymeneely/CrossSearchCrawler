As a consequence of energy efficiency concerns, the exact combination of VMs running on a specific server will most likely change over time. We present experimental results how to use the energy/power consumption logs of a power monitored server as a side-channel that allows us to recognize the exact combination of VMs it currently hosts to a high degree. For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition. As a result, energy consumption data of servers must be protected carefully, as it is potentially valuable information for an attacker trying to track down a VM to mount further attack steps.","","978-1-4673-0006-3","","10.1109/DASC.2011.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119058","","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Power demand;Power measurement;Servers;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;power aware computing;virtual machines","Kolmogorov-Smirnov test;VM;cloud computing;data centers;energy consumption side channel attack;energy efficiency;energy/power consumption;hardware platform;power measurement device;power monitored server;virtual machines","","3","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents NetViewer, a network measurement approach that can simultaneously detect, identify, and visualize attacks and anomalous traffic in real-time by passively monitoring packet headers. We propose to represent samples of network packet header data as frames or images. With such a formulation, a series of samples can be seen as a sequence of frames or video, revealing certain kinds of attacks to the human eye. This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic. We show that ""scene change analysis"" can reveal sudden changes in traffic behavior or anomalies. We also show that ""motion prediction"" techniques can be employed to understand the patterns of some of the attacks. We show that it may be feasible to represent multiple pieces of data as different colors of an image enabling a uniform treatment of multidimensional packet header data.

The role of network features depends on which pattern to be detected: normal or intrusive one. Intrusion detection rates would be better if we know which network features are more important for a particular pattern. We therefore propose an automated feature weighting method for network intrusion detection based on a fuzzy subspace approach.

IEEE International Symposium on","20091228","2009","","","1","10","An emerging class of applications for enterprise wireless LANs (WLAN) is voice over IP (VoIP) applications, which impose a stringent requirement on end-to-end delay. Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device. As a result, the proposed architecture can automatically provide seamless network-layer handoff to a wide variety of mobile devices (such as PDA, portable, cell phone) running on different operating systems, as long as they are equipped with 802.11 network interface.","1526-7539","978-1-4244-4927-9","978-1-4244-4928-6","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366648","","Cellular phones;Delay;Frequency;Hardware;Internet telephony;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Network interfaces;Operating systems;Roaming;Wireless LAN","IP networks;Internet telephony;cellular radio;mobile computing;wireless LAN","Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture;IEEE 802.11 WLAN;PDA;cell phone;cellular networks;device-transparent network-layer handoff;enterprise wireless LAN;micromobility;mobile IP;mobile devices;voice over IP;wireless overlay network","","0","1","18","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accordingly, a variable data classification index has been defined and presented in this paper to classify stored data in cloud servers dynamically and increase the efficiency of this process. The suggested index uses three main parameters (Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, and Data Availability) and several sub-parameters to determine the value of this index dynamically according to the specifications of stored data.

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to an attack called <i>misrouting</i> <i>attack</i>. Packet misrouting disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. I provide a protocol called MlMl based on local monitoring to remedy the attack. It requires the neighbors to maintain additional information about the routing path.

Instead of proving a system satisfies noninterference assertions, we derive an algorithm for checking the assertions at run-time based on the developed theory and a formal model of Unix system calls.

In DPI, packet payload is compared against a large number of rules written in regular expression. To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination. SRD-DFA can be easily used with advanced DFA compression algorithms to achieve much less memory consumption.","","978-0-7695-3929-4","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380614","DFA;Minimization;Regular Expression","Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Explosions;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Power engineering and energy;Throughput","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA compression algorithms;L7-filter rule set;Snort rule set;advanced DFA compression algorithms;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;extended DFA structure;memory consumption;packet payload;subrule distinguishable DFA","","2","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally intrusion detection has relied on two data sources: various log files which record user's activity, and network traffic which contains potential threats. This research presents a system which we call IDEA; the Intrusion DEtection Automata system. We utilize a third source of data for intrusion detection in the form of an instrumented process. Open source software is recompiled using a modified compiler we have created, and the resulting executable program generates the data as it runs. An external monitoring facility then checks the behavior of the program against known good execution paths. These paths are specified either using a domain specific language and hand-written rules, or by running the software in a learning mode and capturing the normal behavior for later comparison.","","978-0-7695-3126-7","","10.1109/ISA.2008.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511526","instrumentation;intrusion detection;open-source","Automata;Computerized monitoring;DSL;Domain specific languages;Information security;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Operating systems;Telecommunication traffic","security of data","computer systems;data source;intrusion detection automata system;network traffic","","1","","17","","","24-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An attack could consist of a large number of packet streams generated by many compromised slaves that consume resources associated with various network elements to deny normal services or a few offending packets to disable a system. Several techniques based on probabilistic samples of transit packets have been developed, to determine the sources of large packet flows. It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases. In this paper, we propose packet digesting schemes for flows and sets of packets sharing the same source and destination addresses. Compared with the individual packet digesting scheme, these schemes can achieve similar goals and are much more scalable. Simulations with real Internet traffic show that the storage requirements of our proposed schemes are one to two orders of magnitude lower.","","0-7803-8533-0","","10.1109/ICC.2004.1312653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1312653","","Communication system security;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Electronic mail;Filtering;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication links;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Bloom filters;IP traceback;Internet security;Internet traffic;destination addresses;distributed denial of service;link capacity;packet digesting schemes;packet sharing;packet streams;source addresses;transit packets","","10","1","17","","","20-24 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, whether for selfish or malicious reasons, a node may fail to cooperate during the network operations or even attempt to disturb them, both of which have been recognized as misbehaviors. Various trust management schemes have been studied to assess the behaviors of nodes so as to detect and mitigate node misbehaviors inMANETs. Most of existing schemes model a node's trustworthiness along a single dimension, combining all of the available evidence to calculate a single, scalar trust metric. A single measure, however, may not be expressive enough to adequately describe a node's trustworthiness in many scenarios. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of MANET node from multiple perspectives. Our scheme evaluates trustworthiness from three perspectives: collaboration trust, behavioral trust, and reference trust. Different types of observations are used to independently derive values for these three trust dimensions. We present simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in several scenarios.","","978-1-4244-7075-4","","10.1109/MDM.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5489228","Misbehavior;Mobile Ad hoc Network;Multi-dimensional trust;Security","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Computer network management;Computer science;Conference management;Engineering management;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Radio spectrum management;Relays","","","","8","","26","","","23-26 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By virtue of the autonomy, mobility, inferential capability and social ability of the mobile agent, the numerous security events which may appear at many locations in the network can be efficiently detected, verified by the sensor agent and the verification agent. Furthermore, the correlation agent can correlate the purified security events globally based on the temporal relation, the causal relation, the spatial relation and statistics relations among them. We select Aglet as the platform and develop a security event management system (SEMS). Finally, through some multi-step attack scenarios, the effectiveness and the advantages of the mobile agent technology used for security event management have been verified.","","","1-4244-1329-X","10.1109/ISI.2007.379550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258691","mobile agent;security event;security event correlation;security event management system (SEMS)","Availability;Collaboration;Data security;Design optimization;Event detection;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Statistics;Technology management","mobile agents;security of data","causal relation;correlation agent;information security prevention system;mobile agent technology;multistep attack scenario;security event management system;sensor agent;spatial relation;statistical relation;temporal relation;verification agent","","0","","5","","","23-24 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SSIDS involves a heterogeneous whitelist and behaviour-based approach to detect known and unknown attacks. The paper investigates and simulates reconnaissance, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks against a practical synchrophasor system that is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SSIDS detection tool. In contrast to previous research in this area that generally has investigated known attacks, this research actively considers the operational features of the IEEE C37.118 protocol and presents a more comprehensive and general solution to deal with not only known attacks but also unknown attacks.","","","978-1-84919-653-6","10.1049/cp.2013.0059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617502","Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Synchrophasor System","","computer network security;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;protocols;smart power grids","IEEE C37.118 protocol;SSIDS;SSIDS detection tool;behaviour-based approach;denial-of-service attacks;heterogeneous whitelist;malicious cyber attacks;man-in-the-middle attack;network security;smart grid control;smart grid monitoring;smart grid protection;synchrophasor specific intrusion detection system;synchrophasor systems;unintended misuse","","2","","","","","27-29 April 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

For the GPU-to-GPU case, we consider several refinements to a base GPU implementation and measure the performance gain from each refinement. For the host-to-host case, we analyze two strategies to communicate between the host and the GPU and show that one is optimal with respect to runtime while the other requires less device memory. This analysis is done for GPUs with one I/O channel to the host as well as those with 2. Experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU that has 240 cores running off of a Xeon 2.8 GHz quad-core host CPU show that, for the GPU-to-GPU case, our Aho-Corasick GPU adaptation achieves a speedup between 8.5 and 9.5 relative to a single-thread CPU implementation and between 2.4 and 3.2 relative to the best multithreaded implementation. For the host-to-host case, the GPU AC code achieves a speedup of 3.1 relative to a single-threaded CPU implementation. However, the GPU is unable to deliver any speedup relative to the best multithreaded code running on the quad-core host. In fact, the measured speedups for the latter case ranged between 0.74 and 0.83.

Malware creates unique challenges to higher learning institutions (HLI) in protecting their information assets. This is largely due to the fact that HLI information technology (IT) departments must balance between enabling a highly collaborative, non-restrictive environment and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and computing resources. HLIs can proactively defend the network to reduce the risks associated with this threat by assessing the vulnerabilities and threats present in their networks and implementing appropriate multilayer security. A multilayer approach involves applying countermeasures at every layer of the computer network, from the perimeter routers and firewalls to users' personal computers in order to increase network security.

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS), on the other hand, does recognize attacks against the network that firewalls are unable to detect. IDS is designed to be a passive entity that is they are invisible to others on the network but this same capability is a handicap when it comes to blocking malicious packets at runtime, which is an essential feature of a Firewall, as it compromises its passive nature. In this paper a firewall architecture is discussed which uses IDS as a core engine for detecting threats and yet retains the ability to block any packet. The architecture employs hardware software co-simulation in order to process packets in real time. The IDS core is mapped onto an FPGA which is responsible for threat perception while the software implements the pass/block mechanism based on the IDS decision. Inside the FPGA, all the rules are applied in parallel on each packet achieving speedup not possible in software. Using the dynamic reconfigurability of the FPGA, the rule set of the firewall can be changed without stopping it.","","0-7803-8871-2","","10.1109/SCONES.2004.1564786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1564786","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware design languages;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Runtime","","","","0","","6","","","30-31 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX).

Practically, the vast majority of the monitoring tools have to deal with the problems related to the database's excessive response time, so their solution is really justified. In this paper an alternative method of network monitoring, the BasicMeter tool will be introduced by which the exact problems and their solution will be illustrated.","","978-1-4577-0196-2","","10.1109/SAMI.2012.6208950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208950","","Data warehouses;Database systems;IP networks;Informatics;Monitoring;Time factors","computer network management;database management systems","BasicMeter tool;computer network;database excessive response time;database preparation;network traffic monitoring","","0","","20","","","26-28 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the contradictory requirements of immediate node failure notification and infrequent analyzer status variation should be both considered. In this contribution, we designed one heartbeat protocol with four variations in publish-subscribe framework.

In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a ""single point of failure "". We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

Most networks today use TCP/IP protocol as the standard to communicate with each other. Each host in the network is uniquely identified by its IP address. In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks. I will construct the secured VOIP communication over MANET area using TCP / IP and storage Data in GSM modem as SMS (inbox).

Following the platform-based design methodology, we have designed and implemented a Â¿Secure PlatformÂ¿ to support Monitoring Applications which is compliant to requirements such as modularity, optimized usage of resource, solution scalability. To this aim, the Secure Platform exploits mobile agents and we have enhanced middleware solutions already available in literature.

In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.","","978-1-4673-6320-4","","10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581","","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training","Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection","Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction","","0","","20","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, access control mechanisms deal with allow or deny a based rule (for access to a file) which even extends to role based access control in some cases. This directly implies that access protection mechanism is generally tightly coupled with almost all operating systems. Still, intrusion is a common phenomenon.

As different kinds of worms spread in the Internet, the interactions among them have strong impact on the propagation of worms. In order to eliminate the negative effect, it is necessary to characterize these interaction behaviors. Accounting for these factors, a model with two mutualistic symbiosis worms is proposed in this paper. The stability of the infection-free equilibrium and positive equilibrium are discussed. Through theoretical analysis, the stability conditions are obtained mathematically. Numerical results from the experiment are in favor of the theoretical analysis. It also indicates that the mutualistic symbiosis worms indeed promote each other's spread in the Internet, which is helpful to design strategies to control the spread of worms.","","978-1-4799-1390-9","","10.1109/MIC.2013.6758077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758077","mutualistic symbiosis worms;numerical simulation;propagation model;stability","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Equations;Grippers;Jacobian matrices;Mathematical model","Internet;invasive software","Internet worm attacks;infection-free equilibrium;mutualistic symbiosis worms;positive equilibrium","","0","","10","","","16-18 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion prevention measures are not guaranteed to work all the time since unrelenting attackers can eventually break them down. An intrusion detection scheme (IDS) monitors a network and looks for intrusions, thus forming a second wall of defense. In this paper, we have proposed a misuse detection -based IDS for MANETs.

In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier. To reduce the computational cost of selecting samples, we propose a clustering method as a first step in order to determine the critical centers, and then we select samples from those critical clusters.

Any attacker in the vicinity can easily get onto the internal network through a rogue AP, bypassing all perimeter security measures. Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.","","978-1-4244-1432-1","978-1-4244-1433-8","10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468","","Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN","","","","9","","16","","","10-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","1","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This report tackles this concern for enterprises in terms of security with intrusion detection while adopting cloud computing. The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network. The data captured will undergo intense data mining through clustering and then performing classification using BOAT algorithm to detect the presence of intruders on the cloud. The mining approach will consider various attributes of the data to scrutinize the user behaviour.","","978-1-4799-6895-4","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014762","BOAT algorithm;Cloud computing;anomaly-detection;centralized resources;data mining;intrusion detection;security","Boats;Classification algorithms;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Decision trees;Intrusion detection","cloud computing;cost reduction;data mining;security of data;virtualisation","BOAT algorithm;anomaly-based IDS implementation;cloud computing;cloud environment;computing cost;data mining;enterprises;intrusion detection;security threats;virtualization","","0","","32","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to stop such attacks is to prevent the attackers from using computers as ""stepping-stones"" for their attacks. A ""Step-Function"" method has been proposed to detect the length of a connection chain from a host to the victim machine. The algorithm is based on the changes in packet round trip times. Due to many network protocol issues, it is impossible to match all such packets correctly. We propose two algorithms to match TCP packet in real-time. The first algorithm matched fewer packets but the matching is correct. The second one matches more packets with some uncertainty on the correctness. The two algorithms gave almost identical results in determining the length of a connection chain. The algorithm gives a way to stop stepping-stone intrusion on the Internet in real-time.","1550-445X","0-7695-2249-1","","10.1109/AINA.2005.240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423618","","Application software;Change detection algorithms;Computer science;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Heuristic algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Uncertainty","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","Internet;TCP packet matching;conservative algorithm;heuristic algorithm;long connection chain detection;network attacks;stepping-stone intrusion detection","","3","","14","","","28-30 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, traffic bandwidth has increased exponentially in the last few years, and high-speed network monitoring is a challenging aim. Performance requirements are highly relevant for monitoring systems. A low-level study of the capturing stages on a traffic analysis system (TAS) has shown room for improvement. We provide an architecture able to cope with high-speed traffic monitoring using commodity hardware. Our design is also intended to exploit the parallelism available in up-to-date workstations.

"How to detect cloned tags in a reliable way from incomplete RFID traces","Lehtonen, M.; Michahelles, F.; Fleisch, E.","Inf.

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.","","978-1-4244-3337-7","978-1-4244-3338-4","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190","","Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management","probability;radiofrequency identification","RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain","","7","5","23","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem is especially challenging in the world of network intrusion detection. In this research we demonstrate that in the domain of offline network data mining, several different data mining algorithms (hybrid intelligence) operating concurrently on the same data in a multi-agent system, and reporting their results for interpretation and interpolation, will yield more accurate characterizations and extract more knowledge than a single data mining algorithm acting on its own. We also briefly outline the design and functions of our SPADE-based multi-agent system, demonstrating its effectiveness at automating multi-path data mining tasks. This code ingests a PCAP, semi-autonomously pre-processes it and feeds it into Weka for processing/mining using several different algorithms. It then presents results to a human operator providing a feedback insertion point.","","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166564","Associate;Classify;Cluster;Data Mining;FIPA;Intrusion Detection;PCAP;Python;SPADE;Weka","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;Multi-agent systems","data mining;interpolation;multi-agent systems;security of data","PCAP;SPADE-based multiagent system;feedback insertion point;human operator;hybrid intelligence-multiagent system;information assurance data mining;information overload problem;interpolation;knowledge extraction;multipath data mining task automation;network intrusion detection;offline network data mining algorithm","","0","","39","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All agents communicate with a fuzzy evaluation engine that combines the results of individual agents using fuzzy rules to produce alerts that are true to a degree. Several intrusion scenarios are presented along with the fuzzy systems for detecting the intrusions. The fuzzy systems are tested using data obtained from networks under simulated attacks. The results show that fuzzy systems can easily identify port scanning and denial of service attacks.

Biologically inspired approaches to security in networks are interesting to evaluate because of the analogies between network security and survival of human body under pathogenic attacks. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network based on multiple low-cost, low-energy sensor nodes connected to physical signals. The network is made up of sensor nodes and gateways, where the server nodes acquire physical world data, while the gateway forwards the data to the end-user. While the spread of viruses in wired systems has been studied in-depth, applying trust in wireless sensor network nodes is an emerging area. This paper uses machine learning techniques to first differentiate between fraudulent and good nodes in the system. Next, it derives inspiration from the human immune system to present an idea of virtual antibodies in the system, to disable the fraudulent nodes in the system.","","978-1-4799-1414-2","","10.1109/NaBIC.2013.6617852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617852","Biologically Inspired;Human Immune System;Machine Learning;Security;WSN","Immune system;Logic gates;Skin","artificial immune systems;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless sensor networks","bio-inspired machine learning;computer networks;fraudulent nodes;good nodes;human immune system;trust;virtual antibodies;wireless sensor network security","","2","","19","","","12-14 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
