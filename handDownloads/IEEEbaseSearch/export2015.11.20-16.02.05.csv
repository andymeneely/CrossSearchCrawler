The amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Prior studies developed feature selection and feature extraction techniques to reduce the size of data. None has focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. Dimensionality reduction is a field in machine learning that consists on mapping high dimensional data into lower dimension while preserving important features of the original dataset. Dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to reduce the amount of data in applications such as speech signals, digital photographs, fMRI scans, DNA microarrays, Hyper spectral data. The purpose of this paper is to find the finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. This evaluation is necessary to improve the efficiency of NIDS in identifying existing attack patterns and recognizing new intrusion in real-time. Two dimensionality reduction techniques are used one linear technique (Principal Component Analysis) and one non-linear technique (Multidimensional Scaling). Data is then submitted to two classification algorithms J48 (C.45) and Naïve Bayes. This study was conducted using the KDD Cup 99 data.

Wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to attacks as they are frequently deployed in open and unattended environments. In this paper, we describe the wormhole attack, a severe routing attack against sensor networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. We detail its characteristics and study its effects on the successful operation of a sensor network. We present state-of-the-art research for addressing wormhole related problems in wireless sensor networks and discuss the relative strengths and shortcomings of the proposed solutions. To date, most of the proposed defenses focus on preventive mechanisms that can be applied to protect sensor networks from this kind of attacks. However, no work has been published regarding the possibility of using more sophisticated methods, like intrusion detection systems, to achieve a more complete and autonomic defense mechanism against wormhole attackers. We present our work on intrusion detection and introduce a lightweight IDS framework, called LIDeA, designed for wireless sensor networks. LIDeA is based on a distributed architecture, in which nodes overhear their neighboring nodes and collaborate with each other in order to successfully detect an intrusion. We conclude by highlighting how such a system can be used for defending against wormhole attackers.","","978-1-4244-4066-5","978-1-4244-4067-2","10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5172466","","Collaborative work;Communication system security;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Protection;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","autonomous sensor device;distributed architecture;intrusion detection system;pervasive interconnection;wireless sensor network;wormhole attack","","1","","21","","","17-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is critical to develop methods to study the interaction between the attacker and defender for finding the optimal allocation of the limited defense resources. In this study, the LR attack considering the attack and defense is modeled by bilevel optimization. Game-theoretic approaches are developed to model the interaction of the attacker and defender for two scenarios for defending critical measurements and for defending critical substations. The attack and defense interaction is modeled by a zero-sum game if only the load curtailment is considered in the utility functions. And it can be modeled by a non-zero-sum game if both the load curtailment and the associated attack cost and defense cost are considered. The proposed approach is tested based on a representative IEEE 14-bus system, and optimal defense strategies are derived in different scenarios. This study can offer some meaningful insight on effectively preventing and mitigating the LR attack.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2015.7286529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7286529","Cybersecurity;bilevel optimization;false data injection attack;game theory;non-zero-sum game","Game theory;Load modeling;MATLAB;Mathematical model","IEEE standards;game theory;load distribution;optimisation;power grids;power system control;power system protection","IEEE 14-bus system;LR attack;bilevel optimization;cyber monitoring;game theoretic approach;limited defense resource optimal allocation;load curtailment;load redistribution attack;optimal defense strategy;power grid;power system control layer;utility function","","","","","","","26-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naïve fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naïve fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably “Attack multipliers” and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network. An efficient detection scheme named Sentinel Protocol is proposed for detecting replica attack in MANET. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938709","Intrusion response;MANET;Mobile nodes;Replica attack;Sentinel Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;attack multipliers;enhanced intrusion detection system;intrusion response techniques;mobile ad hoc network;naïve fuzzy responses;network infrastructure;replica attack;routing attacks;sentinel protocol","","0","","13","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intrusion detection model needs to be continuously tuned in order to reduce correlative alerts and help the administrator to determine accurate and critical attacks. In this work, an alert correlation detection module is proposed to analyze the alerts produced by IDSs and provides a more succinct and overall view of intrusions.

This paper presents the ID-Trace Management Platform, an extension of the simple network management protocol infrastructure based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) script management information base (Script MIB) to support distributed stateful intrusion detection in enterprise networks. It provides mechanisms allowing a management station to delegate security-related tasks to mid-level managers (MLMs) that, in turn, interact with monitoring and action agents to execute these tasks. Protocol trace specification language specifications are used by the MLMs to program monitoring agents that sniff packets on the network comparing their signatures to those of known attack signatures. With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks). The platform also provides notification mechanisms (traps) so that MLMs can report the occurrence of major events to the management station.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514526","Computer network management;computer network security;site security monitoring","Automation;Computerized monitoring;Engineering management;IP networks;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Java;Protocols;Specification languages","Internet;Java;authorisation;business communication;computer network management;digital signatures;program verification;software agents;specification languages;system monitoring;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ID-trace management platform;IDS system;IETF;Internet engineering task force;MLM;SNMP-based platform;action agent;distributed stateful intrusion detection;enterprise network;known attack signature;mid-level manager;notification mechanism;program monitoring agent;protocol trace specification language;script MIB;script management information base;simple network management protocol;site security monitoring;sniff packet;time-consuming configuration","","6","","19","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper puts forward a new method of anomalous intrusion detection based on system call. It uses system calls regarded as input, and creates a FSA (finite-state automation machine) for the functions in the program. Then the FSA is used to detect the attack. Moreover, it can find the place of the vulnerability which exists in the program. This can help to alter the source program.

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers. In this paper, we describe how the integrated architecture of NPU and TCAMs can be exploited to develop high-speed solutions for heavy distinct hitters.","1063-6927","0-7695-2837-3","0-7695-2837-3","10.1109/ICDCS.2007.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268163","","Associative memory;Central Processing Unit;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Data security;Hardware;Sampling methods;Stock markets","content-addressable storage;invasive software;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","associative memory;attack detection;data streams;distributed denial of service attack;heavy distinct hitter;network packet;network processing unit;network router;security attack;ternary content addressable memory;worm attack","","2","","18","","","25-27 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem of identifying misbehaving nodes that drop packets selectively, in order to degrade the network performance is analysed.

SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators.

The network quarantine channels and associated techniques are used to perform further interaction with hosts that have been identified as the source of suspicious traffic.

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as ""virus free"" by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048 × 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681","978-1-4673-5956-6","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","3","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the use of SDN as an approach to assist in the modernization of SCADA systems. We discuss its possible benefits, such as simplified management of power system resources. Moreover, SDN can facilitate the creation of new network applications that previously, with traditional networks, were more complex to be implemented. To illustrate the benefits of the use of SDN in SCADA, we designed a mechanism that aims to prevent a possible eavesdropper from fully capturing communication flows between SCADA components. The mechanism was implemented as an SDN-based application for SCADA systems that uses multipath routing, which relies on SDN features to frequently modify communication routes between SCADA devices. Further, we performed an experimental evaluation to verify the impact and performance of the mechanism in the SCADA network.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140289","","Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Routing;SCADA systems;Substations","SCADA systems;power system management;smart power grids;software defined networking;substations;telecommunication network routing","ICT;SCADA components;SCADA devices;SCADA network performance;SDN-based SCADA systems;communication flows;communication routes;electric system;electricity distribution;electricity transmission;field devices;information and communication technology;multipath routing;network applications;power grids;power system resources management;smart grids;software-defined networking;substations management;substations monitoring;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","31","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Live migration extends the list of benefits server virtualization provides. Almost all virtualization softwares now include support for live migration of virtual machine. Live migration is in its infant stage where security of live migration is yet to be analyzed. The usages of live migration and security exploits over it have both increased over time.

A self-adaptive approach that integrates monitoring, analyzing, and actuation functionalities has the potential to accommodate to a dynamically changing environment. The main objective of this paper is to develop an architecture-based self-adaptive framework to improve performance and resource efficiency of a server while maintaining reliable services. The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.","0730-3157","978-1-4244-7512-4","978-0-7695-4085-6","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339","autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability","SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability","","0","","18","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And if we consider a huge system in terms of users, services and accesses, the difficulty of the analysis task rises enormously. In infra-structures where there is more than one server and communication link, it is possible for the administrator and security team to configure all systems to record their logs in a central huge repository, but the search for abnormalities is quite impossible without specialized tools.

In order to tackle this issue, this paper proposes an IDS alert classification method which is based on data mining techniques.","","978-1-4244-8910-7","978-1-4244-8908-4","10.1109/CNSM.2010.5691262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5691262","alert classification;data mining;intrusion detection","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Humans;Internet;Itemsets;Pattern matching;Sensors","data mining;security of data","data clustering;data mining techniques;frequent itemset mining;intrusion detection system;network IDS alert classification;network monitoring;network protection","","4","","19","","","25-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is impossible for the victim servers to work on the individual level of on-going traffic flows. The scheme establishes IP Flow which is used to select proper features for DDoS detection. Five features are analyzed by the experiments. The IP flow statistics is mainly used to allocate the weights for traffic routing by routers. A new algorithm is thus proposed to get efficiently maximum throughput by the traffic filtering, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in real network circumstances. The algorithm shows its advantages that it is with high average detection and with low false alarm and miss alarm.

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS","","0-7695-2549-0","","10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271","IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network","","3","","16","","","29-29 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems are termed as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Intrusion Detection is the process of monitoring and identifying attempted unauthorized systems access or manipulation. Successful High Performance Computing (HPC) requires a combination of technical innovation as well as political and operational experience to balance out the many (sometimes contradictory) pressures encountered in this field.

On the surface, this should greatly reduce the chances of successfully executing the type of coordinated and distributed cyber attacks necessary to cause large-scale failures. However, existing communications security schemes in power control systems only consider explicit communications. In this paper, we show that there is a rich set of covert communication channels available to attackers for use in coordinating large scale attacks against power grids. Specifically, we present PhyCo, a novel covert channel that leverages physical substrates, e.g., line loads, within a power system, to transmit information between compromised device controllers. Using PhyCo, two compromised controllers that are miles apart can coordinate their efforts by manipulating relays to modify the power network's topology. This can be done without requiring the use of any explicit communication channels, e.g., power line communications, and can evade intrusion detection sensors aimed at overt traffic. We have evaluated PhyCo using real-world programmable logic controllers on a realistic simulated power grid. Our results show that PhyCo can bypass existing intrusion detection sensors as well as physical inspections by carefully crafting covert communications to have minimal exterior consequences within normal operating thresholds.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007771","","Equations;Mathematical model;Power grids;Power measurement;Receivers;Sensors","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;programmable controllers","PhyCo;coordinated cyber attacks;covert channel communication;cyberphysical infrastructures;device controller;distributed cyber attacks;electric power systems;physical interdependencies;power grid;power network topology;programmable logic controller","","0","","24","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations. We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces.

Several bot detection approaches have been proposed which can be classified as either host-based or network-based. A hybrid approach which mitigates the disadvantages of the previous two approaches is proposed here. The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier. Stealthy bots which communicate at large time intervals of up to 32 hours are also detected. 120 bots samples were used to evaluate the system. The experimental results demonstrate a high detection rate of 97.4% and a very low false positive rate of 2.5%. The performance of the system is compared with many recent bot detection methods.","","978-1-4799-2177-5","","10.1109/RAICS.2013.6745439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745439","Botnet detection;Neural Network;host-based;packet traffic;traffic characterization and modeling","Data preprocessing;Entropy;Feature extraction;Filtering;Malware;Neural networks;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;computer network security;entropy;feature extraction;invasive software;neural nets","HTTP traffic;World Wide Web;bot detection methods;bot infected hosts;bot traffic;botnets;data theft;denial of service attacks;entropy;features extraction;high detection rate;network traffic;neural network classifier;spamming;stealthy bots;traffic features;traffic profile;unlabeled traffic","","1","","26","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is considered as a major deficiency while handling heterogeneous and nonstationary data stream to uncover anomaly in the online operational mode. This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area. The performance evaluation confirms that, the proposed method is able to operate in offline as well online modes efficiently.

In this paper, we show how a vulnerable program can be used to create a covert channel that allows an entity (e.g., an attacker) to stealthily send information to another remote entity (e.g., a backdoor). The proposed covert channel, for which we coin the term OverCovert, is based on the common return-to-libc stack-overflow attack and the address space layout randomization defense. We implemented a proof-of-concept of OverCovert under Linux and evaluated its throughput sending files of different formats.

Detection-based mechanisms are considered to be the second defense line against attacks when the traditional prevention based mechanisms failed to detect them. Different intrusion detection schemes have been introduced (e.g. rule based, statistical based...etc). Rule-based intrusion detection schemes are considered to be the fast and simple schemes that are suitable for the demand of WSN. However, these schemes are more specific to some kinds of attacks and cannot be generalized. In addition, these schemes cannot detect the unknown attacks that are not included in their rule base.

In order to tackle this problem a novel idea of using Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) supported by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is proposed.

This paper principally covers the WSN aspect of the project and only gives functioning concepts of the RFID portion. The Zigbee transceiver selected for the solution was ATMEL's ATZB-A24-UFL with the controller, ATmega164p. The WSN ad-hoc network is based on a mesh topology allowing for hoping of data between motes extending the communication radius. The video provides an effective and energy efficient way of transmitting jpegs at 4fps passive and 1 frame per 12 second for active monitoring. The nodes are extremely cost efficient especially compared to Commercial of the Self (COTS) surveillance cameras and far smaller in size.

In recent years, the HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. Due to the high false alarm rate in the classical IDS based on HMM, this paper proposes a Fuzzy approach to the Hidden Markov Models (HMM), called Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models (FHMM). It is introduced with the Fuzzy logic. The system has the simplicity and flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the IDS based on FHMM, its robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. For these reasons, a new intrusion detection method based on FHMM was proposed in this paper. The proposed method differs from STIDE in that only one profile is created for the normal behavior of all applications using short sequences of system calls issued by the normal runs of the programs. Subsequent to this, HMM with simple states along with STIDE is used to categorize an unknown programpsilas sequence of system calls to be either normal or an intrusion. The results on 1998 DARPA data show that the our method results in low false positive rate with high detection rate.","","978-1-4244-1717-9","978-1-4244-1718-6","10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4582476","","Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Sequences;Surveillance","fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;security of data","fuzzy HMM;fuzzy logic;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;pattern recognition","","4","","12","","","3-5 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its design rationale is that web bots behave intrinsically differently from human beings, allowing them to be detected. This paper escalates the battle against web bots by exploring the limits of current HOP-based bot detection systems. We develop an evasive web bot system based on human behavioral patterns. Then we prototype a general web bot framework and a set of flexible de-classifier plugins, primarily based on application-level event evasion. We further abstract and define a set of benchmarks for measuring our system's evasion performance on contemporary web applications, including social network sites.

After logging is finished, it returns to the guest operating system running in the more privileged level and starts the system call.

In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.","","978-0-7695-3495-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046","","Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server","decision trees;security of data","behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length","","3","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed solution does not belong to any of the existing intrusion detection approaches, since it relies on a set of robust, self-contained Random Walk Detectors (RWDs), which may freely move from node to node and randomly traverse a network, while monitoring each visiting node for malicious behaviour. RWDs exhibit a number of benefits including locality, simplicity, low overhead, and robustness to changes in topology.

In this paper, we argue that DoS attack can be taken as continuous data streams, and thus can be detected by using stream data mining methods. More specifically, we propose a new Weighted Ensemble learning model to detect the DoS attacks. The Weighted Ensemble model first trains base classifiers using different data classification algorithms (i.e., decision tree, SVMs, and Naive Bayes) on multiple successive data chunks, and then weights each base classifier according to its prediction accuracy on the up-to-date data. Experimental results on the benchmark KDDCUP'99 dataset demonstrate that our new Weighted Ensemble model is able to successfully detect DoS attacks.","","978-1-4244-8482-9","978-0-7695-4191-4","10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5614743","Data streams;DoS attack;Ensemble model","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Computer crime;Data mining;Data models;Noise measurement","Bayes methods;Internet;computer network security;data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","DoS attack streams detection;SVM;Web security;continuous data streams;data classification algorithms;decision tree;denial of service;naive Bayes;stream data mining;weighted ensemble learning model","","1","","18","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks","Song, Sui; Manikopoulos, C.N.","","Information Assurance Workshop, 2006 IEEE","20060710","2006","","","348","360","Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Res- - ults showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652116","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;File servers;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Quality management;Stability;Throughput","Internet;quality of service;security of data;stability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;three-term control","Internet;PID control;bandwidth attacks;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attack;flow control;flow-based congestion control;flow-based quality-of-service;intrusion detection;multilevel packet classification;rate-limiting;stability","","0","","41","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then RLS (recursive least square) filter is used to predict IF flows. After that, a statistical method using residual filtered process is proposed to detect anomalies.

Ants traverse through the graph to add nodes until the stopping criterion is satisfied. The fisher discrimination rate is adopted as the heuristic information for ants' traversal. In order to avoid training of a large number of SVM classifier, the least square based SVM estimation is adopted. Initially, the SVM is trained based on grid search method to obtain discrimination function using the training data based on all features available. Then the feature subset produced during the ACO search process is evaluated based on their abilities to reconstruct the reference discriminative function using linear least square estimation. Finally SVM is retrained using the train data based on the obtained optimal feature subset to obtain intrusion detection model. The MIT's KDD Cup 99 dataset is used to evaluate our present method, the results clearly demonstrate that the method can be an effective way for intrusion feature selection and detection.","","0-7803-9091-1","","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527615","Network intrusion detection;ant colony optimization;feature selection;machine learning;support vector machines","Ant colony optimization;Computer vision;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Least squares approximation;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;optimisation;search problems;security of data;support vector machines","SVM training;ant colony optimization;discrimination function;grid search method;least square based SVM estimation;machine learning;network intrusion feature detection;network intrusion feature selection;support vector machine","","5","","12","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Event Correlation for Intrusion Detection Systems","Dwivedi, N.; Tripathi, A.","","Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), 2015 IEEE International Conference on","20150402","2015","","","133","139","Intrusion Detection System (IDS) have grown into a mature and feature rich technology that provides advanced features to detect intrusion and provide responses. It also allows the management system for security analysis by monitoring, configuring and analyzing the intrusion data. A better understanding of alerts by using a general framework and infrastructure for detecting intrusions through event correlation strategy minimizes the amount of data generated. Event correlation techniques are needed for two reasons. First, network attack detection is usually based on information or data received from distributed sensors, e.g. intrusion detection systems. During attacks, the generated amount of events is hard to handle and so it is difficult to evaluate the current attack situation for a larger network. Thus, the concept of event or alert correlation has been introduced. Event correlation paints a picture of what is now being called as network or cyber situational awareness and tries to guide the security administrator on the actions that he can take to mitigate the crisis. The aim of the event correlation for intrusion detection system (IDS) is to improve security by correlating events and reduce the workload on an IDS analyst. This correlation has been achieved by getting together similar alerts, thus allowing the analyst to only look at a few alerts instead of hundreds or thousands of alerts. In this paper, we correlate the results of SNORT Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with SEC (Simple Event Correlator) by taking the input from the MIT DARPA (Defense advanced Research Projects Agency) dataset. The alerts generated from Snort are very large and so it is difficult for the administrators to identify them. Here we correlate the alerts based on same name coming from different IP address. This correlation removes the duplication of alerts and thus reduces the information overload on the administrator.","","978-1-4799-6022-4","","10.1109/CICT.2015.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078682","Correlation;DARPA;IDS;SEC;events","Computers;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors","IP networks;computer network security;correlation methods","Defense advanced Research Projects Agency;IDS;IP address;MIT DARPA dataset;SEC;SNORT intrusion detection system;alert correlation;cyber situational awareness;distributed sensors;event correlation strategy;management system;network attack detection;security administrator;security analysis;simple event correlator;workload reduction","","0","","22","","","13-14 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes. In order to keep this type of attacks away from networks, we propose a multi layers approach (SFD) that preserves the safely of data transmission between sensor nodes while detecting the selective forwarding attack. Furthermore, the approach includes reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability.","","","","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160207","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Base stations;Computer science;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Watermarking;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SFD;WSN;data transmission;security attacks;selective forwarding detection;wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a system-level solution, our scheme focuses on both performance stability and hardware/software co-design. To verify the effectiveness of our design, the proposed algorithm is implemented on a state-of-art 16-MIPS-core network processing platform and evaluated with real-life data sets.

"Profiling Users in GUI Based Systems for Masquerade Detection","Garg, A.; Rahalkar, R.; Upadhyaya, S.; Kwiaty, K.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., SUNY, Buffalo, NY","Information Assurance Workshop, 2006 IEEE","20060710","2006","","","48","54","Masquerading or impersonation attack refers to the illegitimate activity on a computer system when one user impersonates another user. Masquerade attacks are serious in nature due to the fact that they are mostly carried by insiders and thus are extremely difficult to detect. Detection of these attacks is done by monitoring significant changes in user's behavior based on his/her profile. Currently, such profiles are based mostly on the user command line data and do not represent his/her complete behavior in a graphical user interface (GUI) based system and hence are not sufficient to quickly detect such masquerade attacks. In this paper, we present a new framework for creating a unique feature set for user behavior on GUI based systems. We have collected real user behavior data from live systems and extracted parameters to construct these feature vectors. These vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles and amount of clicks during a user session. We model our technique of user identification and masquerade detection as a binary classification problem and use support vector machine (SVM) to learn and classify these feature vectors. We show that our technique can provide detection rates of up to 96% with few false positives based on these feature vectors. We have tested our technique with various feature vector parameters and conclude that these feature vectors can provide unique and comprehensive user behavior information and are powerful enough to detect masqueraders","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652076","","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Mice;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","graphical user interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","GUI based systems;computer system illegitimate activity;graphical user interface;impersonation attack;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;support vector machine;user identification","","5","","34","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New rules are used to detect novel or known network attacks. A training and testing dataset proposed by DARPA is used to evolve and evaluate these new rules. The proof of concept implementation shows that the rule generated by GP has a low false positive rate (FPR), a low false negative rate (FNR) and a high rate of detecting unknown attacks. Moreover, the rule base composed of new rules has high detection rate (DR) with low false alarm rate (FAR).","","0-7803-7804-0","","10.1109/CEC.2003.1299940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1299940","","Artificial intelligence;Biological cells;Data structures;Databases;Event detection;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Testing","authorisation;genetic algorithms;telecommunication security","DARPA;crossover;detection rate;dropping condition operators;false alarm rate;false negative rate;false positive rate;genetic operators;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;mutation;network attacks;network intrusion;reproduction;rule evolution approach;testing dataset;training dataset","","3","","15","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In mobile ad-hoc networks, data transmission is performed within an untrusted wireless environment. The lack of centralized infrastructure in ad-hoc network makes it vulnerable to various attacks. Wormhole attack is one of the most severe attacks with mobile ad-hoc networks. In wormhole attack, a malicious node records data packets at one location in the network and tunnels them to another malicious node far away, which retransmits them into the network locally. Some of the researchers have proposed many solutions for wormhole attack. In this paper an efficient method to detect a wormhole attack called modified wormhole detection AODV protocol has been proposed. Detection of wormhole attack is performed using number of hops in different paths from source to destination and delay of each node in different paths from source to destination. The destination is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. The performance of modified wormhole detection AODV protocol is justified by simulations.","","978-1-4799-0190-6","","10.1109/IC3.2013.6612197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6612197","Ad-hoc networks;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole attack","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MAODV;centralized infrastructure;data packets;data transmission;malicious node;mobile ad-hoc networks;wireless mobile hosts;wormhole attack;wormhole detection AODV protocol","","0","","12","","","8-10 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
