HST '09. IEEE Conference on","20090721","2009","","","385","392","The insider threat problem is increasing, both in terms of the number of incidents and their financial impact. To date, solutions have been developed to detect specific instances of insider attacks (e.g., fraud detection) and therefore use very limited information for input. In this paper we describe an architecture for an enterprise-level solution that incorporates data from multiple sources. The unique aspects of this solution include the prioritization of resources based on the business value of the protected assets, and the use of psychological indicators and language affectation analysis to predict insider attacks. The goal of this architecture is not to detect that insider abuse has occurred, but rather to determine how to prioritize monitoring activities, giving priority to scrutinizing those whose background includes access to key combinations of assets as well as those psychological/other factors that have in the past been associated with malicious insiders.","","978-1-4244-4178-5","","10.1109/THS.2009.5168063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5168063","","Computer networks;Employment;Government;Laboratories;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Outsourcing;Protection;Psychology;Social network services","organisational aspects;psychology;security","business value;enterprise-level solution;financial impact;insider attack likelihood;language affectation analysis;malicious insiders;operating losses;psychological indicators;resources prioritization","","1","7","18","","","11-12 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present our methodology for detecting any connection to malicious domain. Our detection method is based on a blacklist of malicious domains. We process the network traffic, particularly DNS traffic. We analyze all DNS requests and match the query with the blacklist. The blacklist of malicious domains is updated automatically and the detection is in the real time. We applied our methodology on a packet capture (pcap) file which contains traffic to malicious domains and we proved that our methodology can successfully detect the connections to malicious domains.

"Controlling malware HTTP communications in dynamic analysis system using search engine","Aoki, K.; Yagi, T.; Iwamura, M.; Itoh, M.","NTT Inf. Sharing Platform Labs., NTT Corp., Musashino, Japan","Cyberspace Safety and Security (CSS), 2011 Third International Workshop on","20111024","2011","","","1","6","Malware is one of the most serious threats on the Internet. Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.","","978-1-4577-1034-6","","10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563","dynamic analysis;malware;search engine;support vector machine","Fires;Internet;Irrigation;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines","Internet;command and control systems;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;Internet connection;URLs;command-and-control;communication prevention;infected user detection;malware HTTP communications;malware analysis;malware communication;malware downloading;search engine;secure dynamic analysis system;support vector machine","","3","","20","","","8-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies this property by testing 356 severe attacks on the SNIDS Snort, configured with an old official rule set. Of these attacks, 183 attacks are zero-days' to the rule set and 173 attacks are theoretically known to it. The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection). The detection rate is however on overall greater for theoretically known attacks (a mean of 54% detection). The paper then investigates how the zero-days' are detected, how prone the corresponding signatures are to false alarms, and how easily they can be evaded. Analyses of these aspects suggest that a conservative estimate on zero-day detection by Snort is 8.2%.","","","","10.1109/HICSS.2014.600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6759203","Computer security;NIDS;code injection;exploits","Computer architecture;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Reliability;Servers;Software;Testing","computer network security;digital signatures","SNIDS;false alarm;signature based network intrusion detection;zero day attacks;zero day detection","","0","","21","","","6-9 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attacks themselves are long-lasting, difficult to expose and often use very advanced hacking techniques. Since they are advanced in nature, prolonged and persistent, the organizations behind them have to possess a high level of knowledge, advanced tools and competent personnel to execute them. The attacks are usually preformed in several phases - reconnaissance, preparation, execution, gaining access, information gathering and connection maintenance. In each of the phases attacks can be detected with different probabilities. There are several ways to increase the level of security of an organization in order to counter these incidents. First and foremost, it is necessary to educate users and system administrators on different attack vectors and provide them with knowledge and protection so that the attacks are unsuccessful. Second, implement strict security policies. That includes access control and restrictions (to information or network), protecting information by encrypting it and installing latest security upgrades. Finally, it is possible to use software IDS tools to detect such anomalies (e.g. Snort, OSSEC, Sguil).","","","","10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160480","","Command and control systems;Data mining;Malware;Monitoring;Organizations;Servers","authorisation;cryptography;data protection","access control;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection;attack vectors;computer systems;encryption;security policies;security upgrades;software IDS tools","","0","","14","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not guaranteed that the bandwidth necessary to transmit all aggregated alerts is always available, which usually result in the transmission of a portion of the alerts, while others are discarded or queued. The transmission of insufficient alert information hinders making correct decisions about attacks, leading to compromising network security. In order to maximize the benefits of data aggregation while minimizing the impact of partial alerts, this paper presents a risk-driven real-time transmission prioritization technique for implementing lossy and lossless aggregation of cyber alerts. Lossy alert aggregation and transmission are managed adaptively by allowing the prioritization and transmission of aggregated alerts according to the risk assessment of such alerts. This paper also presents a risk-driven utilization model that further adapts the aggregation and prioritization in response to dynamic network conditions. The performance results of the proposed techniques are obtained by running simulations on data collected from a mobile network. Simulation results for the aggregation of raw alerts have shown an average reduction of 51% in data storage space and bandwidth usage.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785305","Alert Aggregation;Cyber Security;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Networks;Transmission Prioritization","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Propagation losses","mobile computing;security of data","alert aggregation;alert generation;alert information;cyber alerts;data aggregation;lossless aggregation;lossy aggregation;lossy alert aggregation;mobile networks;partial alerts;real-time transmission prioritization technique;risk driven aggregation prioritization;risk driven utilization model;security data","","0","","11","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We demonstrate-to our knowledge the first-practical attack that exploits a vulnerability in packet processing software to launch a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network infrastructure. This attack uses only a single attack packet to consume the full link bandwidth of the router's outgoing link. We also present a hardware-based defense mechanism that can detect situations where malicious packets try to change the operation of the network processor. Using a hardware monitor, our NetFPGA-based prototype system checks every instruction executed by the network processor and can detect deviations from correct processing within four clock cycles. A recovery system can restore the network processor to a safe state within six cycles. This high-speed detection and recovery system can ensure that network processors can be protected effectively and efficiently from this new class of attacks.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231636","Network security;embedded system security;network attack;network processor;processing monitor;programmable router","Computer crime;Embedded systems;Internet;Network security;Program processors;Routing protocols","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;logic devices","NetFPGA;computer networks;control plane;custom-logic hardware;data plane;denial-of-service attack;hardware-based defense mechanism;network routers;packet forwarding;packet processing software;security issues;software vulnerabilities;software-programmable network processors","","4","","40","","2012-07-03","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we present a model for assessing cost of responses based on three factors, the cost of damage caused by the intrusion, the cost of automatic response to an intrusion and the operational cost. The proposed approach provides consistent basis for response assessment across different systems and environment. In addition, the performance analysis indicates that automated responses systems using this cost metric COSIRS, when deployed can responds quickly enough to thwart active attacks in real time using optimal responses.

Specifically, the Zeus banking botnet is reported to have caused more than 100 million dollars in damages. This type of malware has been around for over ten years, and in 2013 alone was responsible for compromising over one-million computers. The impact of banking botnets (i.e., typically Zeus or its derivatives) can be lessened by exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of their command and control (C&C). Our approach involves: (1) fuzz testing the C&C to identify vulnerabilities and (2) designing exploits that can be used to make bot-herders less effective in their criminal endeavors. The novelty of our approach is its focus on interrogating the C&C and not the compromised clients; however we do not discourage traditional malware removal and clean-up processes. As a complement to traditional processes, we offer our approach to organizations with the proper authority for an active defense (i.e., offensive measures). We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by using the leaked Zeus 2.0.8.9 toolkit that included the C&C web application. The following security flaws exist in the Zeus 2.0.8.9 C&C web application: (1) no authentication between the zbot (i.e., client-side malware) and the C&C, (2) a lack of proper access control in the web application folders, and (3) simple clear text authentication between C&C and the remote bot-herder. Our results suggest that because of these security flaws, a range of offensive measures are viable against the Zeus C&C, including Buffer-Overflow, Denial-of-Service, and Dictionary or Brute Force Attacks.","","978-1-4799-7328-6","","10.1109/MALWARE.2014.6999411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999411","","Banking;Computer crashes;Computer crime;IP networks;Malware;Servers;Software","Internet;authorisation;bank data processing;invasive software;message authentication","C&C Web application;Web application folders;Zeus 2.0.8.9 toolkit;Zeus banking botnet;access control;banking botnets;banking system;brute force attacks;buffer-overflow;commerce system;denial-of-service;dictionary attacks;fuzz testing;inherent command and control vulnerabilities;malware;remote bot-herder;text authentication;zbot","","0","","24","","","28-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growing network rates, rapidly approaching 10 Gbits/sec, and the large number of signatures that need to be scanned concurrently pose very demanding challenges to algorithmic design and practical implementation. In this paper we present SCAMPI, a ground-breaking string searching algorithm that is fast, space-efficient, scalable and resilient to attacks. SCAMPI is designed with a memory-centric model of complexity in mind, to minimize memory traffic and enhance data reuse with a careful compile-time data layout. The experimental evaluation executed on two families of multicore processors, Cell B.E and Intel Xeon E5472, shows that it is possible to obtain a processing rate of more than 2 Gbits/sec per core with very large dictionaries and heavy hitting rates. In the largest tested configuration, SCAMPI reaches 16 Gbits/sec on 8 Xeon cores, reaching, and in some cases exceeding, the performance of special-purpose processors and FPGA. Using SCAMPI we have been able to scan an input stream using a dictionary of 3.5 millions keywords, more than an order of magnitude larger than any published result in the literature and in commercial prototypes, at a rate of more than 1.2 Gbits/sec per processing core.","","","","10.1145/1654059.1654106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375524","","","multiprocessing systems;program compilers;security of data;string matching","Cell BE;Intel Xeon E5472;SCAMPI;Xeon core;algorithmic design;compile-time data layout;data reuse;dictionary;ground-breaking string searching algorithm;hitting rate;memory traffic;memory-centric model;multicore processor;network intrusion detection system;network rate;pattern inspection;processing rate;scalable CAM-based algorithm;string matching","","1","","23","","","14-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key component of the GPS is the security information management (SIM) module where data mining technology is employed to analyze the events (alerts) collected from the LPSs. Once a DDoS attack is recognized by the SIM module, the GPS informs the LPS (IDS/IPS) to adjust the thresholds immediately to block the attack from the sources.

Recently model-based qualitative evaluation has been used for the evaluation of security protocols to quantify security properties in terms of intrusion tolerance using quantitative modeling techniques. However, most of the prior work focused only on measuring security properties, largely ignoring the performance impact of the security mechanisms introduced into the system. In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting. In particular, we analyze how often the IDS should perform intrusion detection to effectively trade security off for performance, or vice versa, for the system to satisfy the application security and performance requirements. Given the mean time to security failure (MTTSF) for the system to reach a failure state, and the response time per rekey operation for the wireless group communicating system as metrics, we identify the optimal intrusion detection rate under which the MTTSF metric can be best traded off for the response time metric.","","0-7803-9427-5","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532047","","Area measurement;Availability;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","radio networks;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;model-based qualitative evaluation;security mechanisms;wireless group communicating systems;wireless networks","","1","","16","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A qualitative content analysis was used to analyse literature on Cloud Computing risks to emphasise its implications from a personal health information perspective. Access management, security issues, legal issues and loss of data are some of the risks that negatively impact the storing of PHRs in the Cloud. These can be mitigated by ensuring that only authorized parties are granted access; ensuring that users do not gain access to other users' data and that data remains encrypted; Cloud providers should comply to audits in order to make sure that proper regulations are followed in securing data in the Cloud; and making backups in case of data loss.

Most current intrusion detection systems focus on hybrid supervised and unsupervised machine learning technologies. The related work has demonstrated that they can get superior performance than applying single machine learning algorithm in detection model. Besides, with the scrutiny of related works, feature selecting and representing techniques are also essential in pursuit of high efficiency and effectiveness. Performance of specified attack type detection should also be improved and evaluated. In this paper, we incorporate information gain (IG) method for selecting more discriminative features and triangle area based support vector machine (TASVM) by combining k-means clustering algorithm and SVM classifier to detect attacks. Our system achieves accuracy of 99.83%, detection rate of 99.88% and false alarm rate of 2.99% on the 10% of KDD CUP 1999 evaluation data set.

Agility is the key for achieving survivable and maintainable distributed systems because the non-deterministic nature of distribution would otherwise leave the system uncontrollable, especially in emerging mobile ad-hoc networks. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is based on a self-organizing and rapidly deployed network of mobile services that collaborate without using any preexisting fixed network infrastructure. Survivability is defined as the capability of a service to fulfill its mission in a timely manner, even in the presence of attacks, threats, or failures. Any failure of a single system may affect a business process; however, the monitoring of many mobile services simultaneously is not an easy task. This paper bridges the analyses of business processes and security threats with an alert mechanism.

In this paper, we present a method to search for arbitrary regular expressions by scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later.

Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results are properly substantiated for better effectiveness, system security and flexibility.","","978-1-4673-5832-3","","10.1109/ACSAT.2012.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516336","Anomaly Detection;Change Detection;Network Intrusion;Outlier Detection;Performance Evaluation;Threshold Algorithms","","data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;SVM;change detection algorithm;change point outlier detection method;classification error;data analysis;data collection;data exchange;data mining;distributed solution procedure;false alarm rate minimization;frequently changing trend identification;information exchange;intelligence building;intelligent subsystem;intrusion detection analysis;learning;network data;network security;real time intrusion detection system;registration error;support vector machine;system security;timely detection","","0","","18","","","26-28 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion detection algorithms.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680854","Classifier combination;False positive rate;Intrusion Detection;SCADA;Security","Accuracy;Data models;Intrusion detection;Protocols;SCADA systems;Testing","SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;security of data;unsupervised learning","DNP3;Ethernet/IP;MODBUS;SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;data injection;electricity generation;gas production;oil production;public networks;standard protocols;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unsupervised intrusion detection technique;unsupervised learning algorithms;water treatment","","1","","41","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the future, the utilization of distributed technologies in combination with their object applications will result in an unprecedented level of knowledge and awareness, creating new business opportunities and expanding existing ones. However, in this paradigm where almost everything can be monitored and tracked, an awareness of the state of the monitoring systems' situation will be important. Given the anticipated scale of business opportunities resulting from new object monitoring and tracking capabilities, IoT adoption has not been as fast as expected. The reason for the slow growth of application objects is the immaturity of the standards, which can be partly attributed to their unique system requirements and characteristics. In particular, the IoT standards must exhibit efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability, which in a hierarchical topology is the role of cluster heads. IoT standards must be robust, scalable, adaptable, reliable, and trustworthy. These criteria are predicated upon the limited lifetime, and the autonomous nature, of wireless personal area networks (WPANs), of which wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a major technological solution and research area in the IoT. In this paper, the energy efficiency of a self-reliant management and monitoring WSN cluster head selection algorithm, previously used for situation awareness, was improved upon by sharing particular established application cluster heads. This enhancement saved energy and reporting time by reducing the path length to the monitoring node. Also, a proposal to enhance the risk assessment component of the model is made. We demonstrate through experiments that when benchmarked against both a power and randomized cluster head deployment, the proposed enhancement to the situation awareness metric used less power. Potentially, this approac- can be used to design a more energy efficient cluster-based management and monitoring algorithm for the advancement of security, e.g. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and other standards in the IoT.","","","","10.1109/TENSYMP.2015.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166243","Internet of Things;Intrusion detection system;Situational awareness;Wireless sensor networks","Energy efficiency;Internet of things;Monitoring;Security;Standards;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WPAN;WSN;distributed technologies;efficient self-reliant management and monitoring capability;heterogeneous network;object monitoring and tracking capabilities;situation awareness measurement;situation awareness metric;wireless personal area networks;wireless sensor networks","","0","","12","","","13-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Test results for the NSL-KDD dataset prove the proposed approach can outperform the standard classifier in terms of attack detection rate and false alarm rate, while reducing the number of features in the dataset.","","","","10.1109/CyberSA.2015.7166116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166116","Binary Bat Algorithm;Dendritic Cell Algorithm;IDS;SVM","Feature extraction;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Particle swarm optimization;Silicon;Support vector machines","artificial immune systems;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","NSL-KDD dataset;SVM classifier;anomaly based IDS model;artificial immune system;asset availability;asset confidentiality;asset integrity;attack detection rate;cyber threats;false alarm rate;immune intelligent approach;information security assurance;intrusion detection system;security threats mitigation;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","","0","","20","","","8-9 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though the correlation process is often presented as a single step, the analysis is actually carried out by a number of components, each of which has a specific goal. Unfortunately, most approaches to correlation concentrate on just a few components of the process, providing formalisms and techniques that address only specific correlation issues. This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model. A tool using the framework has been applied to a number of well-known intrusion detection data sets to identify how each component contributes to the overall goals of correlation. The results of these experiments show that the correlation components are effective in achieving alert reduction and abstraction.

However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","","978-1-4244-5113-5","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes. For our dataset, decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform slightly better than SVM in terms of overall accuracy and weighted recall. Additionally, J48 and PART require less than half of the features (i.e., session attributes) used by SVM, as well as they execute much faster.

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing. The system uses sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms.

To achieve these goals, several papers have explored the concept of mutual revocation (sometimes termed suicide) wherein the trust value of both the accuser and the accused node are temporarily set to zero without involving a quorum. In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.","","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971","Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing","Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority","","1","","18","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior.

In many real-world cases, however, the packet processing operations are performed on a large number of packet flows, each supported by many run-time states. To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets.

The IDSaaS can be roughly classified into two types: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison. We further conduct a study to evaluate this mechanism under a cloud scenario and identify several open problems and issues for designing such a privacy-preserving mechanism for IDSaaS in a practical environment.","","","","10.1109/INCoS.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630405","Cloud Environment;IDSaaS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Privacy Preserving;Signature Matching","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Encryption;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads","cloud computing;data privacy;digital signatures","IDS-as-a-Service;IDSaaS;anomaly-based detection;cloud computing;cloud provider;fingerprint-based comparison;packet inspection;privacy concerns;privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism;privacy-preserving signature;signature matching process;signature-based detection","","0","","47","","","9-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the issue of cyber security has been overlooked by many within the community, these devices provide users with a rich set of context-relevant information including location, usage data, and even the location/state of similar devices within the reach. Cyber Security has become a matter of national, economic, and societal importance. Present-day attacks on the nation's computer systems do not simply damage an isolated machine or disrupt a single enterprise system. Instead, modern attacks target infrastructure that is integral to the economy, and daily life. Computer networks have joined food, water, transportation, and energy as critical resources for the functioning of the national economy. As a result of our interconnected world no device is an island, and security still remains a significant obstacle for ubiquitous and pervasive environments, partially in terms intrusions.

It requires a thorough understanding about the social setting of the security system. To obtain such understanding, sensible steps to take include identifying the players involved in the system, recognizing their personal preferences, agenda and power in relation to other players, identifying the assets being protected, the vulnerable points at which the systems may fail when attacked. Equally important is to taking rationale steps to predict most likely attackers, knowing their possible motivations, and capabilities enabled by latest the technologies and resource occupations. Only based on integrated analysis on both sides, rationale, informative and efficient tradeoffs on security can be made. Unfortunately, current system development practices treat design decisions on security in an ad-hoc way, often as an afterthought. This paper proposes to use social modeling concepts to analyze the business and organizational context of systems with regard to security. The main concepts used are actor, role, agent and goal, task, and resource dependencies between actors.

This paper discusses various characteristics in which SoftMan could be applied to the problem of detecting and responding to intrusions. The paper looks not only at the benefits derived from intelligence, but also at those associated with Multi-SoftMan alliance in general. After exploring these benefits, a novel network security defence mechanism based on Multi-SoftMan is proposed. At the same time, the paper visualizes the architecture and system behaviors of Multi-SoftMan intrusion prevention system (MSMIPS). Relevant abstract mathematical models and detailed inferential equations are founded. The experimental results show that MSMIPS enables member sites in the same trust community or different ones to forewarn attacks cooperatively. Furthermore, SoftMan technology also provides a novel idea for improving detection efficiency to the current network intrusion detection system (N1DS).","","978-0-7695-3290-5","","10.1109/CCCM.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4609541","Agent;Computer security;Cooperation model;Intrusion detection system;Intrusion prevention system;Network security defence;SoftMan","Communication system control;Communication system security;Communications technology;Computer networks;Computer security;Control systems;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Samarium","computer networks;multi-agent systems;security of data;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;multiSoftMan intrusion prevention system;network security defence mechanism","","3","","13","","","3-4 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We find that our system can detect black hole attacks and selective forwarding attacks with high accuracy without depleting the nodes of their energy.","","978-1-4244-1501-4","978-1-4244-1502-1","10.1109/ISSNIP.2007.4496866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4496866","","Australia;Bandwidth;Computer crime;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Protocols;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SVM;centralized intrusion detection scheme;data acquisition;data processing;selective forwarding attacks;sliding windows;support vector machines;wireless sensor networks","","17","","21","","","3-6 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Bands: an inter-domain Internet security policy management system for IPSec/VPN","Yanyan Yang; Zhi Fu; Wu, S.F.","Dept. of Comput.

IFIP/IEEE Eighth International Symposium on","20030422","2003","","","231","244","IPSec/VPN is widely deployed for users to remotely access their corporate data. IPSec policies must be correctly set up for VPN to provide anticipated protection. Manual policy setup is unscalable, inefficient and error-prone. Automated policy generation to comply with and enforce high-level security policies is desired but difficult, especially in an inter-domain environment when a VPN traverses multiple domains. This paper presents a distributed framework and protocol, BANDS, for inter-domain policy negotiation and generation. The BANDS architecture consists of two phases: AS (autonomous system) route path discovery and an inter-domain collaborative protocol for policy negotiation among the autonomous systems discovered in the first phase. Each AS conceptually has one security requirement server responsible for the task of inter-domain policy negotiation. Following this two-step process in BANDS, a set of distributed security policies (for the implementation of policy enforcement) is automatically negotiated/generated based on decentralized and predefined security requirements.","","1-4020-7418-2","","10.1109/INM.2003.1194183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194183","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Data security;Home automation;Internet;Portable computers;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","Internet;business communication;computer network management;protocols;telecommunication security;virtual private networks","AS route path discovery;BANDS;IPSec policies;VPN;automated policy generation;autonomous system;collaborative protocol;corporate data;decentralized security requirements;distributed security policies;high-level security policies;inter-domain policy negotiation;security requirement server","","5","","11","","","24-28 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, an authentication protocol is used to verify and authorize agents acting on behalf of users to protect restricted data and information. After authentication, two agents should be entitled to believe that they are communicating with each other and not with intruders. For specifying and reasoning about the security properties of authentication protocols, many researchers have proposed the use of belief logics. Since authentication protocols are designed to operate in dynamic environments, it is important to model the evolution of authentication systems through time in a systematic way. We advocate the systematic combinations of logics of beliefs and time for modeling and reasoning about evolving agent beliefs in MASs. In particular, we use a temporal belief logic called TML<sup>+</sup> for establishing trust theories for authentication systems and also propose a labeled tableau system for this logic. To illustrate the capabilities of TML<sup>+</sup>, we present trust theories for several well-known authentication protocols, namely, the Lowe modified wide-mouthed frog protocol, the amended Needham-Schroeder symmetric key protocol, and Kerberos. We also show how to verify certain security properties of those protocols. With the logic TML<sup>+</sup> and its associated modal tableaux, we are able to reason about and verify authentication systems operating in dynamic environments.","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2019263","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4909019","Agent-based systems;authentication protocols;labeled tableaux;temporal belief logic;trust theory","","message authentication;multi-agent systems;protocols","Lowe modified wide-mouthed frog protocol;Needham-Schroeder symmetric key protocol;agent-based systems;associated modal tableaux;authentication protocol analysis;belief logics;intelligent agents;labeled tableau system;multiagent systems;trust theories","","1","","47","","2009-05-05","Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. Our starting point in this paper is an overall strategy for network resilience, which draws on existing or under development mechanisms, that can be used to maintain acceptable levels of operation in the event of challenges. A crucial part of this strategy is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a new approach to challenge identification that goes beyond current techniques for attack, anomaly or fault detection. We describe our proposed approach in the context of known network challenge scenarios and identify the gaps in the state of the art that our work is filling. We indicate its validity by showing how it can address the challenge of interference in wireless mesh networks.","","978-1-4244-8167-5","978-1-4244-8166-8","10.1109/NGI.2010.5534459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5534459","","Computer networks;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Filling;IP networks;Information technology;Interference;Resilience;Web and internet services;Wireless mesh networks","Internet;computer network security;interference;wireless mesh networks","Internet;accidental faults;challenge identification;fault detection;malicious attacks;network resilience;operational overloads;wireless mesh network interference","","8","","34","","","2-4 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MobiQuitous 2007. Fourth Annual International Conference on","20080212","2007","","","1","8","The exponential growth in wireless network faults, vulnerabilities, and attacks make the wireless local area network (WLAN) security management a challenging research area. Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.","","978-1-4244-1024-8","978-1-4244-1025-5","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451054","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal analysis;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless channels","WLAN security management;adaptive machine learning;anomaly-based behavior analysis;data mining;denial of service attack;genetic search;multichannel monitoring;network card;self-protection system;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network","","4","1","24","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
