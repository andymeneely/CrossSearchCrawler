"Kangaroo: Accelerating String Matching by Running Multiple Collaborative Finite State Machines","Xiaofei Wang; Bin Liu; Junchen Jiang; Yang Xu; Yi Wang; Xiaojun Wang","Tsinghua Univ., Beijing, China","Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Journal on","20141127","2014","32","10","1784","1796","String matching is a key technique for network security applications such as network intrusion detection systems and antivirus scanners, where the payload of every packet is inspected against thousands of patterns in real time. As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731","Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine","Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput","deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching","ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching","","1","","30","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Even if a lot of research was already done on this topic, the perfect IDS has still not been found and it stays a hot and challenging area in computer security research. This paper presents a simple and robust method for intrusion detection in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA) where each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is then employed to reduce the high dimensional data vectors and thus, detection is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. Our experiments with the KDD Cup 99 dataset, although not yet completed, have shown that this approach is promising in terms of detection accuracy. It is also effective to identify most known attacks as well as new attacks.

Therefore, we propose a framework of survivability model for WSN. Our model adopts software rejuvenation methodology, which is applicable in security field and also less expensive. We model and analyze each cluster of a hierarchical cluster based WSN as a stochastic process based on semi-Markov process (SMP) and discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC).

FPD (File Path Diversity) is a quantized value which measures how far a set of file paths is spread out, and in which abnormal file access behaviours and normal ones show significant differences, making it an effective indicator for detecting malicious processes that controlled by attackers to search and steal valuable files. An algorithm of calculating FPD values is presented, as well as a prototype system based on FPD for detecting malicious processes.

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead. On a 1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine with gigabit Ethernet interfaces, the throughput of the CTCP router is 420.3 Mbits/sec, whereas the throughput of a generic Linux router on the same hardware is only 409.1 Mbits/sec.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377240","","Computer crime;Fingerprint recognition;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;RAKE receivers;Sockets;TCPIP;Throughput","Internet;Linux;open systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine;CTCP router prototype;Internet;Linux kernel;OS fingerprinting;gigabit Ethernet interface;network security;transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture","","2","","39","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a mobile backbone network of trusted nodes is proposed to enhance AODV security with minimum overhead. The proposed backbone network does not violate the MANET mobility characteristic. It is constructed from randomly moving regular MANET nodes based on their trust value, location, and power. The backbone network monitors regular nodes as well as each other to periodically estimate monitoring trust values which represent the reliability of each node in the network.

The proposed scheme loads two hash functions and an initial key into the base station, cluster heads, and sensor nodes. Every node including the cluster heads and sensor node authenticates its neighbor nodes with the initial key. Then every node establishes pair wise key with each of its neighbor node to ensure transmission secrecy. The pair wise keys are updated between node and its neighbors within a random interval time, which is triggered by the base station. The security of this scheme is analyzed and it shows that it is robust to the guessing attacks, replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and node capture attacks.

In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. Multi-objective PSO approach is used for feature selection from a set of 41 features and Random Forests (RF), a highly accurate and fast algorithm, is used for classification.

However, this method is out of date, when gigabit network is booming and the high performance throughput is required. In recent years, the programmable hardware solutions have been proposed but they cannot deal with deep and large amount of pattern matching and are lack of flexibility when signatures are growing up.

In particular, with the spread of Internet technology and Internet security protection technology in recent years, there is a tendency to build remote maintenance systems using the Internet without dedicated communication lines. However, the biggest concern of customers such as electric power companies is security. It is highly necessary to give assurance of the security of remote maintenance systems coherently and consistently in order to introduce such systems based on Internet technology into NPPs. However, there exist various ways of thinking about security. Furthermore, there has not been a general agreement on how to give assurance of the security of remote maintenance systems for NPPs. So we have applied ISO/IEC 15408 to remote maintenance systems for NPPs. It is used to evaluate the security level of IT products and systems. Based on ISO/IEC 15408, we have listed assets to be protected, threats to the assets, security objectives against the threats, and security functional requirements that achieve the security objectives. Also, we have shown relations between the threats and the security objectives, and relations between the security objectives and the security functional requirements. As a result, we have concretized a necessary and sufficient security design of remote maintenance systems for NPPs that can protect the instrumentation and control (I&C) system against intrusion, impersonation, tapping, obstruction and destruction. In this paper, we describe the background of the remote maintenance systems for NPPs, a summary of the systems, and its security design based on ISO/IEC 15408.","","978-4-907764-27-2","978-4-907764-27-2","10.1109/SICE.2007.4421257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4421257","ISO/IEC 15408;Instrumentation and Control System;Nuclear Power Plants;Protection Profile;Remote Maintenance System;Security Target","Collaboration;Communication system security;IEC standards;ISO standards;Inspection;Instruments;Internet;Power generation;Power system protection;Power system security","ISO standards;Internet;maintenance engineering;nuclear engineering computing;nuclear power stations;security of data","ISO/IEC 15408;Internet;nuclear power plant;remote maintenance system;security design","","0","","4","","","17-20 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With low time complexity, the feature selection algorithm independent of detection algorithm could easily balance the detection accuracy and the number of features through threshold.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011","0-7695-2574-1","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","21","2","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender.

The field has become interesting and problems look even more exciting to solve ever since organizations have been trying to tame large volumes of complex and fast arriving Big Data streams through newer computing paradigms. However, extracting meaningful and actionable information from Big Data is a challenging and daunting task. The ability to generate value from large volumes of data is an art which combined with analytical skills needs to be mastered in order to gain competitive advantage in business. The ability of organizations to leverage the emerging technologies and integrate Big Data into their enterprise architectures effectively depends on the maturity level of the technology and business teams, capabilities they develop as well as the strategies they adopt. In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists.

To protect such archives, we propose a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive intrusion detection system. As a first step towards building such a system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, this model exhibits a low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks.

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field. The experiment results show that the proposed model has significantly improved the binary text classification performance in both F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy compared with three other influential baseline models.","","","","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058104","Centroid optimization;Centroid vector;Multi-learning;Text classification;clustering","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Optimization;Testing;Training;Uncertainty;Vectors","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","RCV1;Reuters Corpus Volume 1;binary classification;binary text classification performance;centroid clustering;centroid training;data mining;influential baseline models;iterative multilearning process;machine learning;model CTTC;principal centroid vectors;standard dataset;text classification technology;training process;uncertain decision boundary BND;uncertainty boundary","","0","","20","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system.

This paper proposes a simple architecture for network forensics to overcome the problem of handling large volumes of network data and the resource intensive processing required for analysis. It uses open source network security tools to collect and store the data. The system is tested against various port scanning attacks and the results obtained illustrate the effectiveness in its storage and processing capabilities. The model can be extended to add detection and investigation of various attacks.","","978-1-4244-4790-9","978-1-4244-4791-6","10.1109/IADCC.2010.5422935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422935","FIFO;NFATs;network forensics;port scanning;snort","Computer networks;Data security;Forensics;Hardware;Information analysis;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Internet;network data;network forensic system;network traffic;open source network security tools;port scanning attack;resource intensive processing","","3","","24","","","19-20 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These mechanisms restrict access to user data to explicitly stated workflows--thus preventing malcode from exploiting user data not associated with that application.

Several techniques are introduced to reassemble TCP packets on FPGA. However, they have some disadvantages such as inefficient memory, unscalable system, and unsupported complex TCP connections. In this paper, we propose a multi-linked-list approach and a combination of edge buffering scheme for TCP reassembly, which helps detecting cross packets intrusion signatures. Our architecture not only supports TCP connections with up to 4 concurrent holes, but also uses memory more efficiently than others.

In the last few years a number of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed as network security tools. While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching, header processing and detecting DoS attacks at network level. In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks. The proposed DIDS has host IDS component at each host that combines the above-mentioned functionalities. DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost. The nature of future attacks to the Internet's infrastructure is difficult to predict, and partial reconfigurability feature of FPGA will allow the system to be adapted to a constant change allowing the system to adapt to new threats.","","1-4244-0910-1","1-4244-0910-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228344","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Software systems","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","DoS attacks detection;FPGA;Internet;computer networks;distributed intrusion detection systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware accelerators;header processing;reconfigurable hardware;string matching","","2","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An anomaly dete-ction method based on K-means clustering is introduced to detect and filter request flooding attacks and asymmetric attacks. To defend against session-flooding attacks, we propose an encouragement model that uses client's session rate as currency. Detection model drops suspicious sessions, while currency model encourages more legitimate sessions. By collaboration of these two models, normal clients could gain higher service rate and lower delay of response time.","","978-0-7695-2858-9","","10.1109/ICNS.2007.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438303","","Application software;Business;Computer crime;Delay effects;Floods;Military computing;Pressing;Protocols;Security;Telecommunication traffic","information filters;security of data","DOW;K-means clustering;anomaly detection method;application layer DDoS attacks;asymmetric attacks;attacks layer-7 session flooding attacks;defense and offense wall;filter request flooding attacks;offense mechanism","","6","","15","","","19-25 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To differentiate between normal SQL queries and those sent by an attacker we divide SQL statements into tokens and pass them to our detection system, which predicts the next token, taking into account previously seen tokens. In the learning phase tokens are passed to recurrent neural network (RNN) trained by back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. Teaching data are shifted by one token forward in time with relation to input. The purpose of the testing phase is to predict the next token in the sequence. All experiments were conducted on Jordan and Elman networks using data gathered from PHP Nuke portal.

This work follows the linguistic fuzzy modelling approach. It uses an extended Classifier System (XCS) as mechanism to extract linguistic fuzzy rules. XCS is one of the most successful accuracy-based learning classifier systems. It provides several mechanisms for rule generalization and also allows for online training if necessary. It can be used in sequential and non-sequential tasks. Although originally applied in discrete domains it has been extended to continuous and fuzzy environments.

The sharing of data for data mining can bring a lot of advantages for research and business collaboration. The misuse of these techniques may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. However, large repositories of data contain private data and sensitive rules that must be protected before published. Motivated by the multiple conflicting requirements of data sharing, privacy preserving and knowledge discovery, and privacy preserving data mining has become a research hotspot in data mining and database security fields. Researchers have recently made efforts at hiding sensitive association rules. This paper presents a novel based approach that strategically modifies a few transactions in the database. It modifies support or confidence values for hiding sensitive rules without producing many side effects. Nevertheless, undesired side effects such as nonsensitive rules falsely hidden and spurious rules falsely generated, may be produced in the rule hiding process.","","978-1-4673-0213-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215950","Association Rule;Association Rule mining;Data mining;Mining methods;Privacy Preservation;Rule hiding","Abstracts;Conferences;Data privacy;Databases;Medical diagnostic imaging","data analysis;data mining;data privacy;database management systems;transaction processing","association rule mining;business collaboration;data analysis;data privacy preserving;data repository;data sharing;database security fields;database transactions;knowledge discovery;nonsensitive rules;pattern based framework;privacy preservation;privacy preserving data mining;private data;rule hiding process;sensitive association rules;sensitive information","","0","","13","","","30-31 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011","0-7695-2339-0","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","7","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using this algorithm, the whole network can be divided into some subclusters and carries out an effective intrusion detection mechanism, which performs distributed detection in the whole network and centralized decision-making at local node. In addition, it can reduce the computation load and the amount of bandwidth which is extremely important for MANET due to limited bandwidth and low communication speed in MANET.

Most of the current intrusion detection systems work in isolation to detect these attacks. Past research has shown that collaboration between these networks to share suspicious information is an effective way to detect intrusion. However, there are some challenges associated with the idea of collaborative detection, such as scalability and avoidance of a central point of failure. We propose a peer-to-peer approach for collaborative intrusion detection to address these challenges. Our solution proposes secure data sharing between participants from different organizations using a content based peer-to-peer publish/subscribe mechanism. The proposed scheme improves scalability, while avoiding a central point of failure. Our experimental results show improved detection latency and effective load balancing compared to a centralized architecture.","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635451","","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Software engineering","peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;security of data","collaborative intrusion detection system;data sharing;load balancing;peer-to-peer system;scalability improvement","","4","1","15","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along the path, the nodes before the border routers mark packets with path identification scheme while the border nodes mark packets with IP traceback scheme. The victim can extract and reconstruct the relevant information from malicious arrived packets, and then notify the attack entrance nodes, i.e., the border routers, to filter malicious packets based on marking information.

To evaluate and compare such techniques requires up to date datasets, useful truth data and the ability to record the outputs of the techniques in a common format. Existing datasets for network anomaly detection are either limited / aged or lacking in truth data. This paper presents a new annotation format allowing network datasets to be annotated with arbitrary event data. Use of the new format is demonstrated in a method to create new datasets that retain more information than a simple network capture. The supporting tools for the annotation format allow for incorporating events from multiple different sources.

Unfortunately, existing signature-based intrusion detection techniques are inadequate in providing reasonable degree of Web security. Web attacks are diverse in nature, and typical Web architecture consists of complex and hierarchically organized components. Because attack strategies often vary depending on the Web contents, it is impossible to develop fixed patterns capturing unknown attacks. Protection mechanisms such as anomaly-based intrusion detection and application-level IDS, tailored to Web services, are needed to detect Web attacks. The first step in developing Web application IDS is to analyze and categorize possible Web attacks and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we classify Web attacks by analyzing the root causes and the locations where they occur. This research is useful in developing Web IDS modules, tracking emerging trends on Web attacks, and testing Web applications against potential vulnerabilities.","","0-7695-2108-8","","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286431","","Access control;Computer crashes;Computer science;Frequency conversion;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Service oriented architecture;Web server;Web services","Internet;data privacy;file servers;message authentication;pattern classification;telecommunication security","Web IDS modules;Web application IDS;Web architecture;Web attacks;Web contents;Web security;Web server attack categorization;Web services;Web vulnerabilities;World Wide Web;anomaly-based intrusion detection;application-level IDS;attack frequency;attack strategies;complex components;fixed patterns;hierarchically organized components;protection mechanisms;root causes;signature-based intrusion detection","","2","","21","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OpenFlow protocol is an embodiment of the software-defined networking paradigm. OpenFlow network security applications can implement more complex logic processing flows than their permission or prohibition. Such applications can implement logic to provide complex quarantine procedures, or redirect malicious network flows for their special treatment. Security detection and intrusion prevention algorithms can be implemented as OpenFlow security applications, however, their implementation is often more concise and effective. In this paper we considered the algorithm of the information security management system based on soft computing, and implemented a prototype of the intrusion detection system (IDS) for software-defined network, which consisting of statistic collection and processing module and decision-making module. These modules were implemented in the form of application for the Beacon controller in Java. Evaluation of the system was carried out on one of the main problems of network security - identification of hosts engaged in malicious network scanning. For evaluation of the modules work we used mininet environment, which provides rapid prototyping for OpenFlow network. The proposed algorithm combined with the decision making based on fuzzy rules has shown better results than the security algorithms used separately. In addition the number of code lines decreased by 20-30%, as well as the opportunity to easily integrate the various external modules and libraries, thus greatly simplifies the implementation of the algorithms and decision-making system.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778942","Fuzzy Logic;Information security;OpenFlow;Port scan;Software-Defined Networks","Decision making;Information security;Software algorithms;Switches;Training","decision making;fuzzy logic;protocols;security of data;software radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","Java;OpenFlow protocol;beacon controller;data flows routing;decision making;decision-making module;fuzzy logic-based information security management;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention algorithms;logic processing flows;malicious network flows;malicious network scanning;mininet environment;network infrastructure;network security;processing module;security detection;soft computing;software-defined networks;statistic collection","","2","","7","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MILCOM 2008. IEEE","20090119","2008","","","1","7","A variety of attacks on MANET routing, forwarding, and infrastructure protocols can only be detected using distributed cooperative algorithms. One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.","","978-1-4244-2676-8","978-1-4244-2677-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175","","Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework","","5","","14","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
