This problem arises in various fields, such as computational biology and network security. But the problem is not extensively studied as the single pattern case and there is no efficient algorithm for this problem. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms based on fast Fourier transforms. Let P = {p<sub>1</sub>, . . . , p<sub>k</sub>} be a set of patterns with wildcards where the total length of patterns is |P|, and a text t of length n over alphabet a1 , . . . ,a<sub>σ</sub>. We present two algorithms for this problem where patterns are matched simultaneously. The first algorithm finds the matches of a small set of patterns in the text in O(n log |P| + nk) time. The words used in the algorithm are of size k[2 lg σ] + X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> ⌈Ig |p<sub>i</sub>|⌉ bits. The second one finds the matchings of patterns in the text in time O(n log |P| log σ + nk) by computing the Hamming distance between the patterns and the text. The algorithm uses the words with X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> ⌈lg |p<sub>i</sub>| bits. We also demonstrate an FFT implementation based on the modular arithmetic for machines with word size of 64 bits. Finally, we show that both algorithms can be easily parallelized and the parallelized algorithms are given as well.","","978-1-4244-9482-8","","10.1109/PAAP.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715080","Algorithm;FFT;Multi-pattern matching;Wildcards","Arrays;Computer science;Convolution;Electronic mail;Hamming distance;Pattern matching;Program processors","Hamming codes;fast Fourier transforms;set theory;string matching;text analysis","Hamming distance;fast Fourier transform;pattern matching;set of pattern;wildcard","","0","","13","","","18-20 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.","","978-1-4244-5183-8","978-0-7695-3811-2","10.1109/SCC.2009.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283945","","Data security;Informatics;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Relational databases;Runtime;Stress;Testing;Web services","SQL;Web services;program testing;security of data","SQL injection vulnerabilities;Web services;XPath injection vulnerabilities;security vulnerabilities","","13","","23","","","21-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cyber attacks could block the connection between SCADA Control Centre and its remote devices or insert fake commands/measurements in the equipment communications. With reference to an actual case study, constituted by a SCADA system controlling a portion of a medium voltage power grid and a corporate network, we discuss how cyber threats, vulnerabilities and attacks might degrade the functionalities of SCADA and corporate network, which, in turn, might lead to outages of the electrical grid. We represent SCADA and corporate network under malware propagation, Denial of Service and Man In The Middle attacks and predict their consequent performance degradation. Particularly, we use NetLogo to identify possible malware propagation in relation to SCADA & corporate security policies adopted from the utility and NS2 simulator to compute the consequences of the attacks on SCADA and in turn on power grid.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7223161","Critical Infrastructure Protection;Cyber Attacks;Electrical Grid;Interdependency Analysis;SCADA","Circuit breakers;Malware;Medium voltage;Power grids;Protocols;SCADA systems","","","","0","","12","","","29-31 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of inherent characteristics of intrusion detection, still there is huge imbalance between the classes in the NSL-KDD dataset, which makes harder to apply machine learning effectively in the area of intrusion detection. In dealing with class imbalance in this paper Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to the training dataset. A feature selection method based on Information Gain is presented and used to construct a reduced feature subset of NSL-KDD dataset.

Sub sequently, GAIS utilizes this probabilistic model for sampling new solutions. Thus, the algorithm takes into account the relationships among the variables of the problem, avoiding the disruption of already obtained high-quality partial solutions (building blocks). Besides the capability to identify and manipulate building blocks, the algorithm maintains diversity in the population, performs multimodal optimization and adjusts the size of the population automatically according to the problem. These attributes are generally absent from alternative algorithms, and all were shown to be useful attributes when optimizing the weights of MLPs, thus guiding to high-performance classifiers.

This research work focuses on two techniques for detecting a DoS attack at a medium access control (MAC) layer. Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.","","978-1-4673-2164-8","","10.1109/HPCC.2012.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332322","Denial of Service;Neural Network;Security;Support Vector Machine;Wireless Sensor Networks","Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;real-time systems;support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attack probability detection;MAC;SVM;WSN;denial of service;machine learning;medium access control;neural network;real-time system monitoring;security enhancement;security flaw;support vector machine;wireless sensor network","","1","","14","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection. Simulation results show effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4244-7837-8","978-0-7695-4158-7","10.1109/CICSyN.2010.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615975","Cluster;Denial of service attack;Intrusion detection;Security;Wireless ad hoc networks","","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;pattern clustering;protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized monitoring points;cluster heads;clustered wireless ad hoc networks;co-operative algorithms;distributed intrusion detection architecture;infrastructure protocols;intermittent wireless communications;intrusion related message communication;mobile agents;network security;node clustering","","2","","15","","","28-30 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM.

In this paper, we propose a correlation approach based on sequential pattern mining techniques to fuse related alerts for the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. By mining the alert sequences and iteratively consolidating the matching sequential alert patterns, our approach is able to greatly reduce the related alerts and identify their DDoS membership. The alert reduction and fusing mechanism allow us to concentrate on a higher level of abstraction and thus save much extra efforts spent on analyzing a big volume of trivial raw alerts. Experimental comparisons of our method with hidden Markov model (HMM), a powerful stochastic process for sequence analysis, show that our algorithm is slightly better than HMM in terms of DDoS alert sequence identification.","","0-7695-2274-2","","10.1109/EEE.2005.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402319","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer crime;Data mining;Decision making;Fuses;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Stochastic processes","correlation methods;data mining;decision making;hidden Markov models;security of data","DDoS alert sequence identification;anomalous network activities monitoring;correlation alerts;data mining;decision-making;distributed denial of service attack;fusing mechanism;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system;post-detection analysis;sequence analysis;sequential pattern mining technique;stochastic process","","1","","11","","","29 March-1 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Which emphasis need for intrusion detection systems(IDS) for secureing network. In this process network traffic is analyzed and monitored for detecting security flaws. Many researchers working on number of data mining techniques for developing an intrusion detection system. For detecting the intrusion, the network traffic can be classified into normal and anomalous. In this paper we have evaluated five rule base classification algorithms namely Decision Table, JRip, OneR, PART, and ZeroR. The comparison of these rule based classification algorithms is presented in this paper based upon their performance metrics using WEKA tools and KDD-CUP dataset to find out the best suitable algorithm available. The classification performance is evaluated using crossvalidation and test dataset.

In the developed system, home users equipped with PDAs may locally and remotely receive the alert of home intrusion with captured subject image. There are two key components developed in this system. One is the intrusion image processing (IIP) to recognize the intrusion and extract the intrusion subject. The other is the universal-plug-and-play (UPnP-based) instant messaging (UIM) The proposed IIP employs a modified three-step search (TSS) to improve the accuracy of the subject identification. Through the integrating of the two software component, intelligent intrusion detection is capable of offering a smart home security system. The implementation results show the accuracy of subject identification is about 90%~100%, depending on the granulity of the subject searching.

Researching the efficient CSA method will be helpful to enhance the security protection ability of EPIN. A hierarchical CSA method, which is based on both the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Grey Clustering Algorithm (GCA), is proposed and implemented. The Cyber-threats Situation Value (CSV) is used to describe the cyber-threats situation. The higher CSV shows worse security situation, on the contrary, the lower CSV shows the better. In order to determine the weights of all cyber-threats, the AHP is used to design the hierarchical CSA index system that could divide all cyber-threats into the “Strong”, “Medium” and “Weak” 3 grey clustering classes. At the same time, the GCA is used to construct the criteria layer of index system. The key components of CSV could be clearly shown by those above ways. The CSV value is the summation of products, which products are multiplied by the occurrences number of each cyber-threat and its weight. Finally, the experimental results and system normal operation show that this method can dynamic display the macro security situation of EPIN in real time, with a high practical value.","","","","10.1109/ICNC.2013.6818229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818229","Analytic Hierarchy Process;Cyber-threats Situation Assessment;Cyber-threats Situation Assessment Index System;Cyber-threats Situation Value;Electric Power Information Networks;Grey Clustering Analysis;Security Operation Center","Analytic hierarchy process;Indexes;Internet;Monitoring;Power systems;Real-time systems;Security","analytic hierarchy process;computer crime;computer network security;information networks;pattern clustering;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security","AHP;CSV;EPIN;GCA;analytic hierarchy process;cyber-threat situation assessment;electric power information networks;grey clustering algorithm;hierarchical CSA method;index system;macro security situation;medium grey clustering class;product summation;security protection;strong grey clustering class;weak grey clustering class","","0","","13","","","23-25 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these drawbacks, some researchers suggested to apply Peer-to-Peer approaches in intrusion detection. Most current Peer-to-Peer intrusion detection systems only allow hosts to collect related information from ""neighbours"" (one hop hosts). The limitation of information sources may lead a system to make inaccurate decisions. In this paper, we propose a Mobile Agent Based Peer-to-Peer Distributed Intrusion Detection Framework. Agents are included in this framework to achieve intrusion detections. In addition, a mobile agent migration strategy is applied in the framework to allow agents not only to collect information from direct-linked ""neighbours"" but also other hosts in the network. Benefitted from agent and Peer-to-Peer techniques, our framework can decrease the overhead of each host in the network, reduce the security risk, and achieve more accurate detections.","","978-0-7695-3131-1","","10.1109/ICIS.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529830","","Australia;Computer hacking;Computer science;Distributed computing;Failure analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Peer to peer computing;Software engineering","mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","P2P distributed intrusion detections;hierarchical intrusion detection systems;mobile agent migration strategy;peer-to-peer intrusion detection systems","","3","","10","","","14-16 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe our efforts to develop a database and query language for network attack data from firewalls, intrusion detection systems and honeynets. Our first step toward this objective is to develop a prototype database and query interface to identify coordinated scanning activity in network attack data. We have created a set of aggregate views and templatized SQL queries that consider timing, persistence, targeted services, spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion, thereby enabling us to evaluate coordinated scanning along these dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of the interface by conducting a case study on a set of firewall and intrusion detection system logs from Dshield.org. We show that the interface is able to identify general characteristics of coordinated activity as well as instances of unusual activity that would otherwise be difficult to mine from the data. These results highlight the potential for developing a more generalized query language for a broad class of network intrusion data. The case study also exposes some of the challenges we face in extending our system to more generalized queries over potentially vast quantities of data.","","0-7695-2571-7","","10.1109/ICDEW.2006.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623823","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data engineering;Data mining;Data security;Database languages;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection","","","","2","","17","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation. Our experimental results show that EliMet can optimally make use of prior knowledge as well as automated inference techniques to minimize human involvement and efficiently deduce the expert knowledge regarding individual states of that particular system.","1530-0889","978-1-4673-1624-8","978-1-4673-1623-1","10.1109/DSN.2012.6263941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263941","Power grid critical infrastructure;intrusion detection and response;security metric;situational awareness","Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Security","control engineering computing;inference mechanisms;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system protection;power system security","EliMet;automated inference techniques;bulk electricity delivery system;complex power-grid control network protection;power grid critical infrastructures;security assessment techniques;security incidents;security measures;security metric elicitation","","4","","42","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A popular network-independent technique for malware to spread is copying itself to USB flash drives. In this article we present Ghost, a new kind of honeypot for such USB malware. It detects malware by simulating a removable device in software, thereby tricking malware into copying itself to the virtual device. We explain the concept in detail and evaluate it using samples of wide-spread malware. We conclude that this new approach works reliably even for sophisticated malware, thus rendering the concept a promising new idea.","","978-1-4673-3087-9","978-1-4673-3088-6","10.1109/CRISIS.2012.6378948","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378948","","Ash;Computers;Internet;Malware;Operating systems;Universal Serial Bus","computer network security;invasive software;peripheral interfaces","Ghost;USB flash drives;USB malware;USB storage devices;honeypot;malicious software analysis;malicious software detection;network-independent technique;removable storage device simulation;virtual device","","1","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Successful and time-critical detection of such activity often depends on large-scale deployment. However, commercial organizations usually do not share honeypot data, and large, open honeypot initiatives only provide read-only alert feeds. As a result, while large and resourceful organizations can afford the high cost of this technology, smaller security firms and security researchers are fundamentally constrained. We propose and build a shared infrastructure for deploying and monitoring honeypots, called HoneyLab, that is similar in spirit to PlanetLab. With an overlay and distributed structure of address space and computing resources, HoneyLab increases coverage and accelerates innovation among security researchers as well as security industry experts relying on honeypot-based attack detection technology. Unlike current honeypot infrastructures, HoneyLab allows security firms and security researchers to deploy their own honeypot services, instrumentation code, and detection algorithms, dispensing the need for setting up a separate honeypot infrastructure whenever a new attack detection method needs to be deployed or tested.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319295","honeypot;honeypot infrastructures;security","Costs;Data security;Distributed computing;Feeds;Internet;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Resource management;Space technology;Time factors","Internet;security of data","Internet;commercial organization;honeypot-based attack detection technology;large-scale deployment;malicious activity;planetlab;read-only alert feed;resource sharing;time-critical detection","","1","","25","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dempster-Shafer theory has been used with the purpose of combining beliefs of different metric measurements across multiple layers. However, an important step to be investigated remains open; this is to find an automatic and self-adaptive process of Basic Probability Assignment (BPA). This paper describes a novel BPA methodology able to automatically adapt its detection capabilities to the current measured characteristics, with a light weight process of generating a baseline profile of normal utilisation and without intervention from the IDS administrator.

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved “cause and effect” model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph. The proposed system is evaluated using DARPA 2000 and collected real life data sets. The results have shown an improvement in respect to detection rate and reduction of false positives.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-6695-5","","10.1109/AINA.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474796","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;multi-stage attack","Data mining;Data security;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Libraries;Mars;Redundancy;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data","DARPA 2000;alerts correlation techniques;attack patterns;detection techniques;extensional consequences parameters;knowledge-based model;low-level processing capacity;multistage attack recognition system;network intrusion detection systems;signature-based NIDS;signature-matching","","3","","22","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets.

It applies some special routing protocols, e.g. Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, having the ability to forward the packets in dynamic network topology. The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the flooding attack by applying multiple nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) algorithm to identify the flooding attacker nodes. It also takes the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the flooding attack and after applying the proposed REHIDAN algorithm is tested. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN algorithm reduces the effect of the attack by reducing the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","","978-1-4244-4704-6","978-1-4244-3474-9","10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5010583","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay effects;Floods;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Testing","mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","dynamic network topology;flooding attack;on-demand distance vector routing protocol;real-time host intrusion detection;wireless ad-hoc networks","","2","","15","","","28-30 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing intrusion detection methods treat all data in the network as a whole. However, in reality, data in the network could be divided into two categories: upload data and download data. When intrusion takes place, these two types of dataflow may have different characters. Based on this discovery, we proposed a novel intrusion detection method (U-D method) taking both upload and download data into consideration. With the enhanced separately analysis method, we could figure out intrusion clues more effectively and efficiently. We wonder the relationships between these data might contain some instinct clue for discovering important intrusions.

Although the physical systems themselves are generally designed with high degrees of safety in mind, and designers of computer systems are well advised to incorporate computer security principles, a combined framework for supervisory control of the physical and cyber architectures in these systems is still lacking. Often absent are provisions to defend against external and internal attacks, and even operator errors that might bypass currently standalone security measures to cause undesirable consequences. In this paper we examine a prototypical instance of SCADA network in the distribution network that handles central cooling and heating for a set of buildings.

For example, an attacker may send forged packets to a router with the intention of changing or corrupting the routing table, which in turn can reduce the network connectivity and degrade the router functionalities. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like firewall, authentication mechanisms and intrusion detection system (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect network connectivity offered by routers. In this paper, we propose using honeypot to protect routing protocols. Honeypot is particularly useful to attract attackers, driving them away real routers and allowing the administrators to be aware about intrusion attempts on their networks and the employed techniques that can be recent. Our solution (honeypot router) is to deploy a honeypot playing the role of a router. The honeypot is based on routing software called Quagga and other tools for traffic capture and analysis. The entire solution supervises all routing traffic, so it detects and studies new attacks against routing protocols (RIP, OSPF and BGP).","2151-4763","978-1-4244-4498-4","978-1-4244-4499-1","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411968","Honeypot Router;routing attack detection;routing protocol;routing protocol protection","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer science;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Protection;Routing protocols;Security;Software tools;Telecommunication traffic","routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Quagga;authentication mechanisms;honeypot router;interconnecting networks;intrusion detection system;network connectivity protection;routing protocols protection;routing software;routing table;routing traffic;security techniques","","1","","26","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method is energy inefficient because all nodes have to receive and forward the alarm packet so as to exhaust communication bandwidth and node energy, especially when there are a large number of sensor nodes in the network. This paper develops an energy efficient intrusion prevention mechanism in WSNs called green firewall. It can isolate an intruder with less overhead, and track the intruder to continually prevent the attack. The paper analyzes the overhead cost of the green firewall and compare it with the flooding broadcast method. Extensive analysis and simulations show that green firewall can prevent the attack and effectively reduce redundant alarm packet transmissions which results in less energy consumption.","1930-529X","978-1-4673-0920-2","978-1-4673-0919-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503580","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503580","","","energy conservation;energy consumption;firewalls;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IDS;WSN;communication bandwidth;energy consumption;energy efficient intrusion prevention mechanism;green firewall;intrusion detection system;mobile intruder;redundant alarm packet transmission;security attack;sensor node energy;vulnerablity;wireless sensor network","","3","","22","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, organizations that provide this information do not wish to expose the internal workings of their networks to potential attack. Traffic trace anonymization attempts to mitigate this concern by hiding sensitive information while preserving most of the empirical value of the trace. Unfortunately, many attacks such as statistical fingerprinting, known-plaintext, and port evaluation can serve to identify communications within a trace which can lead an attacker to the real-world identities of anonymized devices. The inherent graph structure embedded in network traffic stands as a primary lever in achieving such de-anonymization. We propose Netshuffle, a method that distorts the graph structure in the anonymized trace such that an attacker cannot rely on the edges (communications) to identify a particular end-node (device). In essence, we shuffle the edges of the graph like a deck of cards so that even if an attacker can identify an edge, that edge does not necessarily connect to the intended target. Thus, inferences based on features of communications will either lead an attacker astray, or force the attacker to guess as to the identity of the targeted node from several indistinguishable candidates. Netshuffle provides a complimentary vector of protection to current anonymization techniques at limited cost in data utility.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5962451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962451","","Equations;IEEE Communications Society;IP networks;Image edge detection;Merging;Peer to peer computing;Topology","IP networks;computer network security","Netshuffle;anonymized devices;deanonymization;graph distortion;inherent graph structure;known-plaintext;network traffic;port evaluation;statistical fingerprinting;traffic trace anonymization","","1","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies. We have also extended the Linux scheduler to disable preemption or migration of threads that are executing transactions with deadlines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves the chance of a transaction meeting its deadline when its progress is hampered by conflicts.","1530-0889","978-1-4244-9232-9","978-1-4244-9231-2","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958224","Contention Management;Scheduling;Transactional Memory","Games;Instruction sets;Linux;Optimized production technology;Rendering (computer graphics);Reservoirs;Runtime","Linux;concurrency control;multi-threading;scheduling;shared memory systems;transaction processing","Deadline-Aware Scheduling;Linux scheduler;Software Transactional Memory;concurrency control;conservative execution;parallel programs;thread migration;transaction execution strategy","","1","","25","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach first extracts behavioral features to train classifiers using data mining techniques that can distinguish malicious and benign executables, and then host level agents are introduced to block the execution of malware instances with their content-based fingerprints. To increase accuracy, an algorithm is proposed that applies a classifier to raw audit data as well as observes the executions of malware in virtualized environments.

Network security and privacy protection without a central manager will be challenging. Several security mechanisms and privacy protections will require the cooperation of several nodes to defend the network from malicious attacks. We particularly investigate when for each node it is cost-effective to freely participate in the security mechanism or protect its privacy depending if that node believes or trusts that all other nodes or at least a minimum number of other nodes will do the same. In this case, each node will be involved in a trust dilemma that we will model using the mathematical framework of game theory and evolutionary game theory.

Since the virtual machines can be running different operating systems and applications, the attacker can generate attacks in the TVD by exploiting a single vulnerability in any of the operating systems or applications. Our aim in this paper is to consider the design choices and develop an intrusion detection architecture that would enable efficient detection and prevention of different types of attacks in such a TVD based distributed environments. The proposed architecture can capture the knowledge of the operating systems and applications at fine granular level and isolate the malicious entities that are generating the attack traffic. Our model takes into account the security policies that are specific to the virtual machine as well as security policies of the trusted virtual domains to deal with the attacks efficiently.","","978-1-4244-9719-5","978-0-7695-4322-2","10.1109/EUC.2010.87","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703572","Intrusion Detection Systems Architecture;Trusted Virtual Domains","","operating systems (computers);security of data;virtual machines","TVD based distributed environment;intrusion detection architecture;operating systems;security attack detection;security policy;trusted virtual domains;virtual machines","","0","","15","","","11-13 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the developed honey pot, all of the architecture, database, directory, security parameters are updated dynamically and timely to evade the probe test from the intruders. To record the traverse of an intrusion, the pheromone will be deposited as discovered. In addition, in order to exactly and correctly measure the capability of the intruders, the content of those discovered file, path and database will be updated and the security setting will also be enhanced timely to raise the difficulty of visiting or access again. All of the traverse of intruders and the corresponding behavior will be analyzed based on ant colony algorithm.

AMETHYST will automatically assess the cause of PIDS alarms and pass to an operator those alarms likely to be caused by an intruder. It will filter out alarms not likely to have a human cause. A previous paper explaining and exploring the AMETHYST concept was presented at the 1995 Carnahan Conference. Since then PSDB has produced a single channel AMETHYST demonstrator and placed a contract for the development of an eight channel prototype AMETHYST system. This updated paper gives details of the hardware and software used with these two systems. Also described is PSDB's approach to the development of AMETHYST's automatic assessment algorithms. These will combine current expertise from Video Motion Detection (VMD) and Intelligent Scene Monitoring (ISM) systems with the unique AMETHYST approach. AMETHYST analyses picture sequences from before and after an alarm instead of continuously analysing live video. Sequences are provided by a Loop Framestore, either connected to or part of the AMETHYST system.

The first contribution lies in reducing the false alarm rate of the attack detection in an agent-based architecture by using honeypot network as the closer level of investigation. The connection is retrieved to the original destination in case of false alarm recognition, while the actions are hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS. The second contribution applies the game theoretic analysis in the sense that the contributing agents are led to perform the best they could in order to achieve their goals. The Shaply value is computed to find the actual contribution of each agent in the coalition he belongs to. The equilibrium point is found and consequently the winner coalition is formed. In this paper the architecture of the proposed system is described, a theoretical analysis of agents' behavior is given and its possible extensions are explained.","","978-1-4244-3999-7","978-0-7695-3639-2","10.1109/WAINA.2009.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136631","","Computer architecture;Game theory;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Multiagent systems;Performance analysis;Real time systems;Scalability","game theory;multi-agent systems;security of data","attack detection;distributed cooperative agents;false alarm ratio;false alarm recognition;game theoretic analysis;honeypot network;intrusion detection systems;multiagent based approach","","0","","11","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although naive selfish strategies based on dropping data packets are readily detected, more sophisticated strategies that manipulate ad hoc routing protocols present a greater challenge. In this work we develop a method to distinguish selfish peers from cooperative ones based solely on local observations of AODV routing protocol behavior. Our approach uses the finite state machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build up a statistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We apply a series of well-known statistical tests to features derived from this description to partition the set neighboring nodes into a cooperative and selfish class. Simulation results for a non-mobile ad hoc network show that our approach can detect two different types of routing manipulation while maintaining a low rate of false positives.","1087-4089","0-7695-2509-1","","10.1109/ISPAN.2005.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1575855","","Ad hoc networks;Automata;Automatic testing;Bandwidth;Computer science;Data mining;Intelligent networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;finite state machines;routing protocols;statistical testing","AODV routing protocol;finite state machine;free-rider;nonmobile ad hoc network;reputation mechanism;selfish peer;selfish routing behavior;statistical description;statistical test","","5","","15","","","7-9 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the flexibility provided by their dynamic infrastructure MANETs are vulnerable to many types of security attacks. Furthermore, many conventional security solutions have been developed. However, these proposals suffer from the problems of tests and evaluations. Among these solutions the intrusion detection systems (IDS) .To improve the quality of protection of MANETs provided by intrusion detection systems (IDS), we provide assessment of detection and test procedures more effective. In this paper, we make a thorough analysis of existing attacks. For this we propose a new system to classify attacks based on attributes that appear to be the best classification criteria to generate test-cases. We also apply the classification tree method (CTM) to select test-cases to attack. Finally, we use the CTE (Classification Tree Editor) tool to generate and select test-cases.","","978-1-4799-3823-0","","10.1109/ICMCS.2014.6911292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6911292","Attack;CTE;CTM;IDS;MANETs;Test-cases;classification","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Jamming;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;trees (mathematics)","CTE tool;CTM;IDS;MANET;classification tree editor;classification tree method;dynamic network infrastructure;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;representative attack test-cases;security attacks","","0","","29","","","14-16 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The infrastructure implements services for the transfer, execution, and protection of mobile agents. Security services are usually provided by implementing new security mechanisms that are explicitly tailored to mobile components. Unfortunately, developing sound, reliable security mechanisms is a non-trivial task, and a history of vulnerable and/or incomplete implementations of these mechanisms led to the idea that mobile code systems are inherently insecure, too complex, and very difficult to deploy. To overcome these problems, we developed a mobile code system that relies as much as possible on the security mechanisms already provided by the underlying operating system. By doing this, it is possible to develop, with reduced effort, security services that rely on well-known, well-understood, and well-tested security mechanisms. Also, by describing the security of the mobile code system in terms of the OS security mechanisms, system administrators can better evaluate the security implications of deploying the system. This paper describes the design and implementation of our system and compares its performance to several existing mobile code systems.","","0-7695-2284-X","","10.1109/ICECCS.2005.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467904","Mobile Agent Security;Mobile Code;OS Security","Collaborative software;Computer science;Computer security;History;Java;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Network servers;Operating systems;Protection","mobile agents;mobile communication;object-oriented programming;operating systems (computers);security of data","OS security mechanism;OS-level mechanism;autonomous mobile components;mobile agents;mobile code security;mobile code systems;operating system;security services","","0","","20","","","16-20 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conducted is a series of experiments to identify the weakest point of the current Internet interconnection system. Based on the lessons from our simulation results, we present a set of guidelines for robust interconnection together with alternative options designed to increase the reliability of the entire interconnection system. In particular, we propose two alternatives of robust interconnection: 1) a failure-prevention interconnection option whereby a separate interconnection backup network is operated in case of emergency and 2) a dispersed hub option that disperses interconnection hubs across regions in advance to limit the extent of damage caused by failure. Finally, we compare and evaluate pros and cons of the proposed alternatives.","","978-1-4244-2172-5","978-1-4244-2173-2","10.1109/SYSOSE.2008.4724166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724166","NGN;Network reliability;internet interconnections;risk modeling","Banking;Broadcasting;Educational institutions;IP networks;Internet;Next generation networking;Quality of service;Risk analysis;Robustness;Stability analysis","IP networks;Internet;convergence;failure analysis;interconnections;risk analysis;stability;telecommunication network reliability","Internet reliability;Internet risk analysis;Korean Internet interconnection network;all-IP convergence;failure-prevention interconnection;next generation network;stability","","0","","14","","","2-4 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Factoring integers, computing discrete logarithms, and pattern matching in network intrusion detection systems (IDS) are popular tasks in the field of information security where GPUs are used for acceleration. GPUs are commodity components and are widely available in computer systems which would make them an ideal platform for a wide-spread IDS. We investigate the feasibility to use current GPUs for asynchronous host intrusion detection as proposed in a former work and come to the conclusion that several constraints of GPUs limit the use for concurrent and asynchronous off-CPU processing in host IDSs. GPUs have restrictions in terms of continuity, asynchronism, and unrestricted access to perform this task. We propose an observation mechanism and discuss current constraints on autonomous use of standard GPU components for intrusion detection.
