Third International Conference on","20080722","2008","","","211","218","This paper presents an application of Bayesian networks to the process of intrusion detection in computer networks. The presented system, called Basset (Bayesian system for intrusion detection) extends functionality of Snort, an open-source NIDS, by incorporating Bayesian networks as additional processing stages. The flexible nature of this solution allows it to be used both for misuse-based and anomaly-based detection process; this paper concentrates on the anomaly-based detection. The ultimate goal is to create a hybrid, misuse anomaly based solution that will allow interaction between these two techniques of intrusion detection. Ability to alter its behaviour based on historical data is also an important feature of the described system.","","978-0-7695-3179-3","","10.1109/DepCoS-RELCOMEX.2008.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4573059","Bayesian networks;anomaly detection;intrusion detection","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Engines;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","belief networks;computer networks;security of data","Bayesian networks;anomaly-based detection process;anomaly-based intrusion detection;computer networks;misuse-based detection process;;open-source NIDS","","3","","11","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It protects users' privacy by creating separated SSL sessions for each user, while the WEP shares one encryption key among all users. In the proposed system, in order to access the Internet, a user shows ""SPKI-based authorization ticket"" in SSL client-authentication phase instead of an ordinary X.509 certificate. The SPKI-based authorization ticket proves that the user has appropriate rights from the system while not showing his/her ID. A user can also access the Internet in another way that the user does not register his/her ID in contrast with existing secure wireless LAN systems. The proposed system restricts usable protocols and prevents unauthorized user from attacking to the Internet. By hiding user IDs from gateways, a user can retain his/her privacy.

However, user credentials can be stolen and an attacker (using a stolen credential) can masquerade as the legitimate user and penetrate the system as an insider. This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen. The technique is validated with the real incident data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in detecting compromised users, while allows eliminating around 80% of false positives (i.e., not compromised user being declared compromised).","1060-9857","978-1-4577-1349-1","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076770","Bayesian network;correlation;credential stealing;intrusion detection;security","Authentication;Bayesian methods;IP networks;Monitoring;Protocols;Vectors","belief networks;security of data","NCSA;authentication protocols;data driven Bayesian network approach;national center for supercomputing applications;security incidents;shared computing infrastructures;stolen credentials;storage capabilities","","6","","25","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network is the collection vehicles interlinked by wireless links and willing to store and forward data for their peers. As vehicles move freely and organize themselves arbitrarily, message routing is done dynamically based on network connectivity. Compared with other ad-hoc networks, VANETs are particularly challenging due to the part of the vehicles' high rate of mobility and the numerous signal-weakening barrier, such as buildings, in their environments. Due to their enormous potential, VANET have gained an increasing attention in both industry and academia. Research activities range from lower layer protocol design to applications and implementation issues. A secure VANET system, while exchanging information should protect the system against unauthorized message injection, message alteration, eavesdropping. The security of VANET is one of the most critical issues because their information transmission is propagated in open access (wireless) environments. A few years back VANET has received increased attention as the potential technology to enhance active and preventive safety on the road, as well as travel comfort Safekeeping and privacy are mandatory in vehicular communications for a grateful acceptance and use of such technology.

As engineering educators whose academic focus is information assurance and cyber security, we believe students in cyber security need the same type of access to hands on opportunities as their counter parts in hardware design or circuit design. Students should be able to configure and run their own networks, as well as explore the vulnerabilities, exploits, and remediatios needed in a cyber security professional's tool kit. Further, they need exposure to working in the complexity of the Internet. While some might argue that simulation software could be a solution, it often lacks realism. In this paper we show how our institution goes beyond the providing the standard, formalized laboratory activities for our cyber security students by developing a unique, highly configurable testbed called Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment (ISEAGE - pronounced “ice age”) that allows us to imitate the Internet. ISEAGE provides a controlled environment that allows real attacks to be played out against the students' networks and demonstrates to them real world security concepts. This paper provides an overview of how the ISEAGE security testbed functions, as well as illustrates how ISEAGE provides our students five different types of opportunities for real world experience: support of formalized classroom work; cyber defense competitions for high school, community college and four year students; inquiry-based learning in a playground environment for high school, as well as college students; testing environment for network devices such as firewalls, data loss protection, intrusion detection; research environment for senior and graduate student work.","0190-5848","","","10.1109/FIE.2013.6685034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685034","cyber security;information assurance education;laboratory exercises;testbed","Computer security;Computers;Educational institutions;Internet;Servers;Testing","Internet;computational complexity;computer aided instruction;computer science education;digital simulation;security of data","ISEAGE security testbed functions;Internet complexity;Internet-scale event attack and generation environment;circuit design;college students;cyber defense competitions;cyber security professional tool kit;cyber security students;data loss protection;engineering educators;engineering programs;firewalls;formalized classroom work;graduate student work;hardware design;high school students;information assurance;inquiry-based learning;intrusion detection;laboratory exercises;learning experiences;playground environment;simulation software;synthesizing experiences;technology programs","","0","","4","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is due to the inherent benefits of virtualization including fault tolerance through checkpoint/restart (C/R) mechanisms. Because clouds are the abstraction of large data enters and large data enters have a higher potential for failure, it is imperative that a C/R mechanism for such an environment provide minimal latency as well as a small checkpoint file size. Recently, there has been much research into C/R with respect to virtual machines (VM) providing excellent solutions to reduce either checkpoint latency or checkpoint file size. However, these approaches do not provide both. This paper presents a method of check pointing VMs by utilizing virtual machine introspection (VMI). Through the usage of VMI, we are able to determine which pages of memory within the guest are used or free and are better able to reduce the amount of pages written to disk during a checkpoint. We have validated this work by using various benchmarks to measure the latency along with the checkpoint size. With respect to checkpoint file size, our approach results in file sizes within 24% or less of the actual used memory within the guest. Additionally, the checkpoint latency of our approach is up to 52% faster than KVM's default method.","","","","10.1109/CCGrid.2014.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846477","Checkpointing;Cloud;Virtualization","Checkpointing;Kernel;Linux;Memory management;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","checkpointing;cloud computing;fault tolerance;virtual machines;virtualisation","C/R mechanisms;VMI;checkpoint/restart mechanisms;cloud computing environments;fault tolerance;system-level virtualization;virtual machine introspection","","0","","30","","","26-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeypot is one of effective mechanism to detect and analyze intruders activities. Since packets sent to honeypots are almost always malicious, thus false alerts, that is serious problems in the normal intrusion detection system, are minimized. However, there are two important disadvantages in honeypot. First, the scope of a honeypot is limited to the address it attached. Second, there are potential risk that honeypot is compromised by a smart intruder. In this paper, we propose a centralized surveillance of unused address space.

The existing DNS update may experience serious performance problem when the normal Internet route is unstable or unavailable due to DDoS attacks. By setting up indirect route via a set of proxy servers from the target side DNS server to the client side DNS server, the DNS zone data can be transported over Internet via the indirect routes to foil the DDoS attack. After the IR DNS update, the end users can get the indirect routing information by querying the DNS server, and set up indirect route to the target server accordingly. The IR DNS update is an essential part of the Secure Collective Defense (SCOLD) system, and it can be utilized independently as an extension to the existing DNS update utility. This technique can also be utilized to protect the root DNS servers from DDoS attacks. The implementation of the IR DNS update on BIND 9 is presented.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol to deliver packets to the destination in the presence of multiple persistent adversaries that deploy different types of simple to extended attacks.","","978-1-4577-0025-5","","10.1109/CTS.2011.5898964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898964","WSN security;directional antennas;recovery;secure routing","Computer crime;Directional antennas;Protocols;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","computer network reliability;computer network security;directive antennas;safety-critical software;wireless sensor networks","decision-making;directional antennas;mission-critical areas;network availability;network reliability;ns-2;persistent adversaries;security;wireless sensor networks","","2","","21","","","8-11 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rationale for this comes from the need to have an overall view of security events or storms that are occurring on a network while providing information in reference to severity and a propagation pattern.

Tampering with the kernel data is an attractive venue for rootkit writers since malicious modifications in the kernel are harder to identify compared to their user-level counterparts. So far however, the pattern followed for tampering is limited to hiding malicious objects in user-space. This involves manipulating a subset of kernel data structures that are related to intercepting user requests or affecting the user's view of the system. Hence, defense techniques are built around detecting such hiding behavior. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a new class of stealthy attacks that only exist in kernel space and do not employ any hiding techniques traditionally used by rootkits. These attacks are stealthy because the damage done to the system is not apparent to the user or intrusion detection systems installed on the system and are symbolic of a more systemic problem present throughout the kernel. Our goal in building these attack prototypes was to show that such attacks are not only realistic, but worse; they cannot be detected by the current generation of kernel integrity monitors, without prior knowledge of the attack signature.","1081-6011","0-7695-2848-1","","10.1109/SP.2007.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223229","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Detectors;File systems;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes","data integrity;data structures;invasive software;operating system kernels","attack signature;kernel code;kernel data structures;malicious modifications;stealthy attacks;systemic threats","","15","","18","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach is to build a graph such as rule trees or finite automata for a given rule set, and traverse it using a packet as an input string. Because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. Exploring such a huge graph becomes a major bottleneck in high-speed networks since each packet incurs many memory accesses with little locality. In this paper, we propose rule hashing for fast packet classification in intrusion detection systems. The rule hashing, combined with hierarchical rule trees, saves memory and reduce the number of memory accesses by allowing the whole working set to be accommodated in a cache in most of the time, and thus improves response times in finding matching rules. We implement our algorithm in Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that our implementation is faster than original Snort to deal with the same real packet traces while consuming an order of magnitude less memory.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-2389-7","978-1-4244-2390-3","10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674280","","Automata;Databases;Engines;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Tree graphs","cryptography;finite automata;trees (mathematics)","CPU time;Snort;finite automata;graph;hierarchical rule trees;open-source intrusion detection system;packet classification;rule hashing;rule-based intrusion detection system;security threats","","2","","13","","","3-7 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This signifies the existence of degrees of uncertainty in the process of intrusion detection.

Moreover, such a flow-based intrusion detection approach can be used in high speeds since it is based on information in packet headers, and, therefore, has to handle a considerably lesser amount of data. The proposed framework is tested on the data obtained with the help of a realistic cyber environment (RGCE) that enables one to construct real attack vectors.

Some stages of the attack may appear innocent if checked separately. Furthermore, the intervals between these separate attack stages can be on the order of hours, days, or even months. These characteristics of multi-stage attacks make the detection task challenging for most existing IDSs that are stateless in that they perform intrusion detection by independently checking individual packets, connections or sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, active event correlation (AEC), which collects and correlates suspicious network events inside a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). AEC infers the possibility of attacks in the context of security policies and blocks attacks before they are completed. We have implemented AEC on top of the Bro NIDS (Paxson, 1999). Experiments indicate that AEC can effectively recognize and correlate individual stages of multi-stage attacks, stop incomplete attack stages, and give network administrators meaningful and concise alerts","","0-7695-2564-4","","10.1109/IWIA.2006.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609998","","Aggregates;Bridges;Computer crime;Computer science;Conferences;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security","Bro NIDS;active event correlation;computer attacks;multistage attack detection;network intrusion detection system;security policies","","2","","20","","","13-14 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Investing on intrusion prevention forbade its use for securing many networks. This study proposes a very basic way to prevent intrusions without any additional cost. Snort is a free open source IDS, which we have integrated with a Cisco router to prevent intrusions. Cisco routers are very common in today's networks. Other routers like Juniper, or even simple ADSL or SOHO routers can be used but with minor changes for the router specific configuration. As ADSL is very common nowadays, ADSL routers are present everywhere and they can easily replace the Cisco router used in this study and provide intrusion prevention capabilities for homes and businesses which otherwise are not able to afford it. Router and computer (to be used as a sensor) are fundamental components of every major network, so, the proposed system does not need any additional hardware. Snort is used as an IDS and alerts are logged to a database from where they are read and router Access Control List (ACL) rules are generated based on Snort intrusion alerts and then these ACL rules are configured on the router to block the potential intrusions. Method for removing ACL rules is also proposed, which may be required under some circumstances. In a fine tuned Snort IDS, false alarms will be minimum and most of the alerts will indicate intrusions. Hence, proposed system can work best to prevent intrusions with a fine tuned Snort IDS.","","978-1-4244-8057-9","","10.1109/ICET.2010.5638482","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5638482","ACL Generation;Access Control List (ACL);Intrusion Prevention;Router;Router Configuration;Snort","Databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Protocols","computer network security;telecommunication network routing","ACL rules;ADSL routers;SOHO routers;cisco router;free open source IDS;intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention;potential intrusions;router access control list rules;snort IDS alerts;snort intrusion alerts","","0","","21","","","18-19 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Neuro-Fuzzy classifiers are used for the initial classification of the initial network traffic. An inference system, Fuzzy inference systems is further used to determine whether the activity is normal or malicious. Efficient IDS systems are those capable of reducing false positives and generate high rate attack detection. However, fuzzy inference systems use human knowledge to create their fuzzy rule. In order to introduce a more accurate way of classifying network traffic, we introduce the use of Genetic Algorithms in conjunction with ANFIS so as to optimize data classification and obtain the best results.

Biologically inspired approaches to security in networks are interesting to evaluate because of the analogies between network security and survival of human body under pathogenic attacks. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network based on multiple low-cost communication and computing devices connected to sensor nodes which sense physical parameters. While the spread of viruses in wired systems has been studied in-depth, applying trust in WSN is an emerging research area. Security threats can be introduced in WSN through various means, such as a benevolent sensor node turning fraudulent after a certain period of time.

In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event.

By exploiting the vulnerabilities in cyber components and intruding into the local area networks of the control center, corporation, substations, or by injecting false information into communication links, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data, reconfigure devices, and send trip commands to the intelligent electronic devices that control the system breakers. Reliability of the power system can thus be impacted by various cyber attacks. In this paper, four attack scenarios for cyber components in networks of the SCADA system are considered, which may trip breakers of physical components. Two Bayesian attack graph models are built to illustrate the attack procedures and to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks. A mean time-to-compromise model is modified and adopted considering the known and zero-day vulnerabilities on the cyber components, and the frequencies of intrusions through various paths are estimated. With increased breaker trips resulting from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities in the IEEE reliability test system 79 are estimated. The simulation results demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable as the frequency of successful attacks on the cyber components increases and the skill levels of attackers increase.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2396994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042739","Bayesian attack graph model;critical infrastructure protection;cyber security;cyber-physical systems;power system reliability;supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system","Local area networks;Protocols;SCADA systems;Security;Servers;Substations","Bayes methods;SCADA systems;belief networks;local area networks;power grids;power system reliability;power system security;security of data","Bayesian attack graph model;IEEE reliability test system;SCADA cybersecurity consideration;communication link;information and communication network;intelligent electronic device;load probability;local area network;mean time-to-compromise model;power grid;power system reliability evaluation;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","0","","31","","2015-02-16","July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to timely detect intrusions and defend against attack attempts. However, the current IDS technology generates a huge volume of alert events due to false alarm alerts, and requires costly alert manual reviewing due to the lack of intelligence in IDS. As a solution, security information management (SIM) is a growing area of interest in network security. In this paper, we propose FAR-FAR (frame-based attack representation and first-order logic automatic reasoning) system in SIM to relieve the administrator from the time-consuming and costly alert manual reviewing. With the backward-chaining, FAR-FAR can make real-time reasoning for network attack scenarios. In FAR-FAR, the aggregated alerts from different IDS agents are converted into uniform frame-structured streams by case grammar. Afterwards, first-order logic production rules are used to extract the hidden attack scenarios. Our simulation results show that FAR-FAR's attack scenario reasoning rate for the incoming alerts are generally far less than the incoming alerts' inter-arrival time. This guarantees FAR-FAR to automatically reason the attack plans in real time and predict possible attack attempts at an early stage.","","0-7803-8932-8","","10.1109/ITRE.2005.1503109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1503109","","Acoustic sensors;Artificial intelligence;Automatic logic units;Data security;Data visualization;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Production","Internet;backward chaining;frame based representation;frame relay;telecommunication security","Internet;frame-based attack representation;intrusion detection system;network security;real-time first order logic automatic reasoning;security information management;uniform frame-structured stream","","0","","11","","","27-30 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Another is the lack of commercial tools to assist in the technique for software. Most SFTA research efforts have been directed at requirements or code. Performing SFTA on the design may enable application of SFTA to critical code only, thus reducing the amount of effort.

By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test.

Experimental results show that the number of character comparisons and windows shifts of improved algorithms is clearly reduced comparing with the BM and BMH and BMHS algorithms.","","978-1-4673-2630-8","","10.1109/DCABES.2012.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385327","Pattern matching; BM algorithms; BMH algorithms; BMHS algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Software algorithms","algorithm theory;pattern matching;security of data","BM algorithm;BMH algorithm;BMHS algorithm;adjacent character;attempt window;improved algorithm;intrusion detection system;jump distance;pattern matching algorithm;position information;windows shifts","","0","","6","","","19-22 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Symposium on","20081222","2008","","","485","491","Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an autonomous distributed network which is constructed only with gathered nodes on the spot. In MANET, wide area communication on wireless networks can be realized because a node relays other node's packets by adopting a multi-hop routing protocol. Security is an indispensable issue in MANET because an unknown node may join the network easily. However, the demand for the level of authentication and its response time is different depending on the environment and applications. Thus, we focus on real-time control of the security mechanism for MANET. In this paper, we have established multi-hop communication environment and introduced methods to control secure connections by applying IPsec as an encryption scheme, on top of the general-purpose operating systems with enabled preemption for interruption. Under such conditions, we have measured response time of CPU with or without load of other applications. We have evaluated the influence of streaming as an application load and investigated on a security realization method for MANET.","","978-0-7695-3471-8","","10.1109/ISPA.2008.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725184","IPsec;Mobile Ad hoc Network;Mobile Computing;OLSR;Preemptive Kernel;Security;Streaming;Ubiquitous Computing","Authentication;Communication system control;Communication system security;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Relays;Routing protocols;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks","IP networks;ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;message authentication;mobile radio;operating systems (computers);routing protocols;telecommunication security;transport protocols","IPsec encryption scheme;MANET;authentication scheme;autonomous distributed network;general purpose operating system;mobile ad hoc network;multihop communication network;multihop routing protocol;preemptive interruption;real-time security control;security mechanism response time evaluation;wide area communication;wireless network","","0","","16","","","10-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSNs are a promising candidate to fulfill these requirements, but if the WSN becomes part of the CI in order to improve its reliability, then the dependability of the WSN itself needs to be significantly improved first. In this article we discuss the challenges and potential solutions to achieve dependability of WSNs taking into account accidental failures as well as intentional attacks.

Here all the resources are at one place in data centers. Cloud uses public and private APIs (Application Programming Interface) to provide services to its consumers in multitenant environment. In this environment Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS), especially HTTP, XML or REST based DDoS attacks may be very dangerous and may provide very harmful effects for availability of services and all consumers will get affected at the same time. One other reason is that because the cloud computing users make their request in XML then send this request using HTTP protocol and build their system interface with REST protocol such as Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure. So the threaten coming from distributed REST attacks are more and easy to implement by the attacker, but to security expert very difficult to resolve. So to resolve these attacks this paper introduces a comber approach for security services called filtering tree. This filtering tree has five filters to detect and resolve XML and HTTP DDoS attack.","","978-1-4673-1516-6","","10.1109/SCEECS.2012.6184829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184829","Cloud Computing;Distributed Denial of Service Attacks;IaaS;Network security;Paas;REST;SaaS","Cloud computing;Computer crime;IP networks;Matched filters;Simple object access protocol;XML","XML;application program interfaces;cloud computing;security of data;transport protocols","Amazon EC2;Distributed Denial Of Service Attack;HTTP DDoS attack;HTTP protocol;Microsoft Azure;XML DDoS attack;application programming interface;cloud computing protection;comber approach;infrastructure as a service;multitenant environment;platform as a service;software as a service","","2","","23","","","1-2 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The structure of two-layered access control is given, it contains two kinds of modules such as the top access control module in metadata server and the lower access control module in intelligent disk.

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware. We also evaluate them in terms of performance and the resources that they require.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903487","Xen;cloud computing;forensics;introspection;intrusion detection;monitoring;security;virtual machine;virtualization","Forensics;Kernel;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","cloud computing;digital forensics;invasive software;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","FVM;Mini-OS virtualised operating system;Xen virtualisation platform;cloud defence;forensic virtual machines;guest virtual machines;image vulnerability;malicious activities;malicious behaviour discovery;malware","","2","","29","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose VMDriver, a general and fine-grained approach for virtualization monitoring. The novel design of VMDriver is the separation of event interception point in VMM level and rich guest OS semantic reconstructions in management domain. With this design, variant monitoring drivers in management domain can mask the differences of guest OSes. We implement VMDriver on Xen and our experimental study shows that it introduces very small performance overhead. We demonstrate its generality by inspecting four aspects information about the target virtual machines with different guest OSes.

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions. This paper presents a novel tree-based hybrid TCAM+SRAM solution for the purposes of both TCAM space reduction and power saving. The experiments show that the proposed solution achieves significantly more savings on both memory space and power consumption on packet matching than existing solutions.","","978-0-7695-4879-1","","10.1109/PDCAT.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589360","SRAM;TCAM;multi-match;packet classification","Educational institutions;Indexes;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand;Protocols;Random access memory","SRAM chips;content-addressable storage;tree data structures","NDIS;TCAM memory space reduction;TCAM power saving;architectural solutions;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;network packets;network routers;packet header;power consumption;search speed;ternary content-addressable memory;tree-based hybrid TCAM-plus-SRAM solution","","1","","11","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Seminar on","20090714","2008","1","","3","6","According to the relationship between the antibody density and the pathogen attack intensity, a dynamic immunity-based real-time network risk evaluation method (DIRNR) is presented. In DIRNR, the concepts and formal definitions of self, nonself, antibody, antigen and immune detector in network risk evaluation domain are given. Then, depending on a series of immune responses to antigen, such as self evolution, self tolerance and immune detector lifecycle, the mathematical models for describing the change of network risk are established. Building upon the above models, a real-time network risk calculation model based on antibody density is presented. By using DIRNR, the types and intensity of network attacks can be calculated in real-time. In DIRNR, the concept of the antibody density in a biological immune system has been abstracted and extended, and a new method based on antibody density for network risk evaluation has been presented. The theoretical analysis and the experimental results show that the proposed method is a good solution to real-time evaluation for the network risk.","","978-0-7695-3560-9","","10.1109/ISBIM.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5164772","antibody density;immune response;network risk evaluation;pathogen attack intensity;real-time","Biological system modeling;Cells (biology);Cloning;Computational Intelligence Society;Computer science;Data security;Detectors;Immune system;Pathogens;Protocols","","","","0","","9","","","19-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Seventh IEEE International Conference on","20080331","2007","","","393","398","The ability to mine data represented as a graph has become important in several domains for detecting various structural patterns. One important area of data mining is anomaly detection, particularly for fraud, but less work has been done in terms of detecting anomalies in graph-based data. While there has been some work that has used statistical metrics and conditional entropy measurements, the results have been limited to certain types of anomalies and specific domains. In this paper we present graph- based approaches to uncovering anomalies in domains where the anomalies consist of unexpected entity/relationship deviations that resemble non- anomalous behavior. Using synthetic and real-world data, we evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms at discovering anomalies in a graph-based representation of data.","","978-0-7695-3019-2","978-0-7695-3033-8","10.1109/ICDMW.2007.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476697","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bipartite graph;Conferences;Credit cards;Data analysis;Data mining;Entropy;Information analysis;Needles;Sun","","","","13","","14","","","28-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They monitor network traffic by searching for unusual combinations in protocol headers and for malicious patterns in the packet payloads. In this paper we present ""Matryoshka"", a vulnerability that allows tunneled malicious packets to bypass the signature mapping procedures implemented in many industrial IDPS. Matryoshka is implemented as a tool and tested against Snort under different topologies and modes. To mitigate attacks that can be initialized using the bypassed tunneled malicious packets, a Snort preprocessor was developed and tested, and results demonstrated that all malicious tunneled packets were successfully detected. Processing overhead of the preprocessor to inspect and decapsulate tunneled packets was measured at 2% of the overall overhead of inspecting, decapsulating, and matching the malicious signature, and at 0:2% of the overall overhead of inspecting, decapsulating, assembling, and matching the signature.","","978-1-61284-380-3","","10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999864","Fragmentation;Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems;SNORT®;Tunneling","IP networks;Inspection;Network topology;Protocols;Security;Topology;Tunneling","computer network security","Matryoshka vulnerability;Snort preprocessor;bypassed tunneled malicious packet;computer network security;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;malicious signature decapsulation;malicious signature inspection;malicious signature matching;signature mapping procedure","","0","","23","","","4-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Hybrid Method for Feature Selection Based on Mutual Information and Canonical Correlation Analysis","Sakar, C.O.; Kursun, O.","Dept. of Comput.

However, under-sampled classes or rare but certain relations are overlooked by this measure, which can result in missing relevant features that could be very predictive of variables of interest, such as certain phenotypes or disorders in biomedical research, rare but dangerous factors in ecology, intrusions in network systems, etc. On the other hand, Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) is a nonlinear correlation measure effectively used to detect independence but its use for feature selection or ranking is limited due to the fact that its formulation is not intended to measure the amount of information (entropy) of the dependence. In this paper, we propose Predictive Mutual Information (PMI), a hybrid measure of relevance not only is based on MI but also accounts for predictability of signals from one another as in KCCA. We show that PMI has more improved feature detection capability than MI and KCCA, especially in catching suspicious coincidences that are rare but potentially important not only for subsequent experimental studies but also for building computational predictive models which is demonstrated on two toy datasets and a real intrusion detection system dataset.","1051-4651","978-1-4244-7542-1","","10.1109/ICPR.2010.1060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5597870","","Accuracy;Biomedical measurements;Correlation;Entropy;Joints;Kernel;Mutual information","correlation theory;entropy;feature extraction;operating system kernels;security of data;statistical analysis","KCCA;PMI;feature selection algorithm;information entropy;intrusion detection system;kernel canonical correlation analysis;nonlinear correlation measure;predictive mutual information","","1","","9","","","23-26 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Real world computer vision highly depends on reliable, robust systems for recognition of motion cues to make accurate high-level decisions about its surroundings. In this paper, we present a simple, yet high performance low-level filter for motion detection and estimation in digitized video signals. The algorithm is based on constant characteristics of a common, 2-frame interlaced video signal, yet its applicability to generically acquired image sequences is shown as well. In general, our approach presents a computationally low-cost solution to motion estimation application and compares very well to existing approaches due to its robustness towards environmental changes. A simple application of motion parameter estimation based on a pedestrian surveillance application is illustrated","","0-7803-6725-1","","10.1109/ICIP.2001.959033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959033","","Application software;Filters;Image processing;Motion detection;Motion estimation;Object detection;Parameter estimation;Robustness;Video compression;Video sequences","band-pass filters;image sequences;motion estimation;parameter estimation;surveillance;video signal processing","common 2-frame interlaced video signal;computer vision;digitized video signals;direction estimation;dynamics;high performance low-level filter;image sequences;motion cues;motion detection;motion estimation;motion parameter estimation;pedestrian surveillance;robust motion detection;speed estimation;video sequences;video surveillance","","1","2","9","","","2001","07 Oct 2001-10 Oct 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore in MANETs, the nodes themselves should be responsible for their own security. We propose a novel approach for trust management in MANETs that is based on the nodes' own responsibility of building their trust level and node-level trust monitoring. The main contribution of this work is in the introduction of a Node based Trust Management (NTM) scheme in MANET based on the assumption that individual nodes are themselves responsible for their own trust level. We explore and develop the mathematical framework of trust in NTM. Finally, in this context, we demonstrate our scheme with notations, algorithms, analytical model and prove of its correctness.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","978-0-7695-4159-4","10.1109/NSS.2010.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635570","MANET;Trust;Trust Management System;cluster;node;route","Ad hoc networks;Context;Markov processes;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Security","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","MANET;NTM;mobile ad-hoc networks;node-based trust management scheme","","6","","27","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
