"Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection","Ye, N.; Yebin Zhang; Borror, C.M.","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on","20040405","2004","53","1","116","123","Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2004.823851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169","","Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing","Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security","Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size","","38","1","56","","","March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This anomaly detection approach is part of an intrusion warning system (IWS) for dynamic coalition environments. It is designed to indicate suspicious actions and tendencies and to provide decision support on how to react on anomalies.

"Robust Correlation of Encrypted Attack Traffic through Stepping Stones by Flow Watermarking","Xinyuan Wang; Reeves, D.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on","20110314","2011","8","3","434","449","Network-based intruders seldom attack their victims directly from their own computer. Often, they stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones” in order to conceal their identity and origin. To identify the source of the attack behind the stepping stone(s), it is necessary to correlate the incoming and outgoing flows or connections of a stepping stone. To resist attempts at correlation, the attacker may encrypt or otherwise manipulate the connection traffic. Timing-based correlation approaches have been shown to be quite effective in correlating encrypted connections. However, timing-based correlation approaches are subject to timing perturbations that may be deliberately introduced by the attacker at stepping stones. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based-correlation scheme that is designed specifically to be robust against timing perturbations. Unlike most previous timing-based correlation approaches, our watermark-based approach is “active” in that it embeds a unique watermark into the encrypted flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. The unique watermark that is embedded in the encrypted flow gives us a number of advantages over passive timing-based correlation in resisting timing perturbations by the attacker. In contrast to the existing passive correlation approaches, our active watermark-based correlation does not make any limiting assumptions about the distribution or random process of the original interpacket timing of the packet flow. In theory, our watermark-based correlation can achieve arbitrarily close to 100 percent correlation true positive rate (TPR), and arbitrarily close to 0 percent false positive rate (FPR) at the same time for sufficiently long flows, despite arbitrarily large (but bounded) timing perturbations of any distribution by the attacker. Our paper is the first that identifies 1) accurate quantitative tradeoffs between the achievable correlation effectiveness - nd the defining characteristics of the timing perturbation; and 2) a provable upper bound on the number of packets needed to achieve a desired correlation effectiveness, given the amount of timing perturbation. Experimental results show that our active watermark-based correlation performs better and requires fewer packets than existing, passive timing-based correlation methods in the presence of random timing perturbations.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551157","Network-level security and protection;correlation;intrusion tracing;stepping stone.","Correlation;Cryptography;Decoding;Delay;Robustness;Watermarking","cryptography;random processes;watermarking","encrypted attack traffic;false positive rate;flow watermarking;network based intruder;random timing perturbation;stepping stones;true positive rate;watermark based correlation scheme","","1","","37","","2010-08-19","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, new network applications, such as intrusion detection systems, require information about all the matching results. We call this the multi-match classification problem. In several complex network applications, multi-match classification is immediately followed by other processing dependent on the classification results. Therefore, classification should be even faster than the line rate. Pure software solutions cannot be used due to their slow speeds. We present a solution based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), which produces multi-match classification results with only one TCAM lookup and one SRAM lookup per packet - about ten times fewer memory lookups than a pure software approach. In addition, we present a scheme to remove the negation format in rule sets, which can save up to 95% of TCAM space compared with the straight forward solution. We show that using our pre-processing scheme, header processing for the SNORT rule set can be done with one TCAM and one SRAM lookup using a 135 KB TCAM.","","0-7803-8686-8","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375197","","Application software;Associative memory;CADCAM;Complex networks;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer crime;Computer worms;Delay;Intrusion detection;Random access memory","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;table lookup","135 KB;SRAM lookup;header processing;intrusion detection systems;multi-match packet classification;negation format;rule sets;ternary content addressable memory","","21","","14","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant. And even we try to use the sporadic well-mannered cooperative behavior of the malicious node in favor of improving overall throughput of our WSN. Based on rationality we believe that even malicious nodes before being known as extreme notorious nodes, they try to impersonate their true type and show a little collaborative behavior.","0840-7789","978-1-4244-5376-4","978-1-4244-5377-1","10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575157","Nash equilibrium;Subgame perfect equilibrium;WSN — Intrusion detection system (IDS);attack-resistant mechanism;repeated game","Games;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nash equilibrium;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-defense problem;cooperative Nash equilibrium;dropping-packet attacks;game-theoretical model;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","1","","23","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, our approach uses a computationally low-cost solution to define the area of interest for tracking of multiple, moving objects. Despite its simplicity, it compares very well to existing approaches due to its robustness towards environmental changes. To demonstrate this, we present results of processing a sequence of JPEG-compressed monocular images of a parking lot in order to track pedestrians, cars and bicycles. Despite a high level of noise and changing lighting conditions, the algorithm successfully segments a moving object and tracks its position along a trajectory.","","0-7695-2319-6","","10.1109/CRV.2005.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443140","Interlace Filter;Motion Detection;Motion Tracking;Surveillance","Computer vision;Filters;Image coding;Image sequences;Motion detection;Motion estimation;Robustness;Tracking;Video compression;Working environment noise","computer vision;filtering theory;image sequences;motion estimation;target tracking;tracking filters;video signal processing","2-frame interlaced video signal;JPEG-compressed monocular images;computer vision systems;high performance low-level filter;interlace filter;motion tracking;multiple moving object tracking;noisy image sequences;people tracking;robust motion detection;robust motion estimation;surveillance","","4","","10","","","9-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most cases are trapped in the system due to a huge backlog of cases, excessive litigation in urban areas, corruption by the court staff and lack of proper monitoring of the functioning of courts. Efficient supervision and monitoring of courts can help in resolving some of the key problems in the system. We present preliminary results from a novel case record-keeping, management and monitoring solution that is able to meet several key performance goals of the National Judicial Policy. The overall aim of the work is to facilitate the work of the monitoring judges by helping them find the proverbial needle in the haystack and not get deluged by the volume of data routinely produced by the typical case-management systems. In this paper, we explore the application of intrusion detection techniques, such as the statistical anomaly detection schemes, to case management systems and present the results from our extensive case studies. Our proposed system, now in pilot, shows high accuracy in flagging anomalous cases, reduces the overall volume of information generated by the system and can help target several of the key reasons behind case pendency while bringing much needed transparency to the overall case-flow.","","","","10.1109/HICSS.2014.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758839","Judiciary;anomaly detection;monitoring","Auditory system;Delays;Engines;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optical character recognition software","law administration;security of data","Pakistan;case management systems;case record-keeping;case-management systems;intrusion detection techniques;judicial process delay;litigation;national judicial policy;remote court monitoring;statistical anomaly detection schemes","","0","","19","","","6-9 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides pointing out that data-flow-based detectors can be layered on top of control-flow-based ones (or vice versa) to improve accuracy, there is a large gap between the two research directions in that research along one direction had been fairly isolated and had not made good use of results from the other direction. In this paper, we show how data-flow analysis can leverage results from control-flow analysis to learn more accurate and useful rules for anomaly detection. Our results show that the proposed control-flow-analysis-aided data-flow analysis reveals some accurate and useful rules that cannot be learned in prior data-flow analysis techniques. These relations among system call arguments and return values are useful in detecting many real attacks. A trace-driven evaluation shows that the proposed technique enjoys low false-alarm rates and overhead when implemented on a production server.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721575","anomaly detection;control-flow;data-flow;system call argument","Computer security;Control system analysis;Control systems;Counting circuits;Data analysis;Detectors;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis","data flow analysis;security of data","anomaly detection;control-flow analysis;control-flow-based detectors;data propagation;data-flow analysis;data-flow-based detectors;false-alarm rates;intrusion detection;production server;system calls","","3","","21","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These targeted attacks use special-crafted malware and infrequent activity to avoid detection, so that hackers can retain control over target systems unnoticed for long periods of time. In order to detect these stealthy activities, a large-volume of traffic data generated in a period of time has to be analyzed. We proposed a scalable solution, Ctracer to detect stealthy command and control channel in a large-volume of traffic data. APT uses multiple command and control (C&C) channel and change them frequently to avoid detection, but there are common signatures in those C&C sessions. By identifying common network signature, Ctracer is able to group the C&C sessions. Therefore, we can detect an APT and all the C&C session used in an APT attack. The Ctracer is evaluated in a large enterprise for four months, twenty C&C servers, three APT attacks are reported. After investigated by the enterprise's Security Operations Center (SOC), the forensic report shows that there is specific enterprise targeted APT cases and not ever discovered for over 120 days.","","978-1-4673-7277-0","","10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207270","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT);Command and Control (C&amp;C);mapreduce;networking logs","Command and control systems;Computers;Electronic mail;Internet;Itemsets;Malware;Servers","business data processing;computer crime;digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software","APT attack;C&C channel;C&C sessions;Ctracer;SOC;Security Operations Center;advanced persistent threat;enterprise log data;forensic report;hackers;malware;network signature;scalable framework;stealthy activities detection;stealthy command and control channel detection;targeted attacks;traffic data","","0","","25","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The behavior of the system is defined in terms of a ""behavior set"" rather than using a single parameter. This facilitates greater accuracy in describing the behavior of the system and helps in reducing false-positives.

Usually, network researchers develop their own tools, sometimes from scratch, to fit the requirements of their experimentations, and these tools are then abandoned when the paper is published. In this study, we emphasize the importance, for the network research community, to use and contribute to the development of open source measurement tools. In this regard, we propose a survey and classification of IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters and open source tools available to collect or estimate these parameters. We highlight the parameters that can be extracted from wireless traffic probes and those that are available through the driver of wireless cards. Then, we introduce and compare open source tools that can be used to make the measurements, with special attention to the flexibility of the tools and their application scope.

The First International Conference on","20060508","2006","","","8 pp.","","Most current anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDSs) detect computer network behavior as normal or abnormal but cannot identify the type of attacks. Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","6","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets are groups of compromised computers controlled by a botmaster through a command and control (C&C) channel. They are noted as one of the foremost security threat causing large scale attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Spam, mass identity theft and click fraud. Various approaches are used to detect botnets and they range from network to host level detection. To enhance the detection rate, a correlation based model was proposed that combines both host and network level information. Such a model is valid in a network made of trusted hosts. The emergence of smartphones with the capability of mobility and being hosts in different networks, open the door of having untrusted hosts that can reveal fake information. As a solution, we propose a trust-based model that uses cooperative game theory to cluster trusted hosts. The trust is built using the reputation value and it is computed using the hosts' marginal contribution which is derived from Shapley value. Simulation results show that our model improves the detection score compared to the traditional correlation model. Where in one of the simulated scenarios we are able to detect a benign cluster of hosts faster than the traditional correlation model.","","978-1-4673-5306-9","","10.1109/ICCITechnology.2013.6579517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6579517","Botnet;botnet detection system;cooperative game theory;correlation;game theory","Computational modeling;Correlation;Data models;Game theory;Games;Ports (Computers);Security","command and control systems;correlation methods;game theory;invasive software;smart phones;unsolicited e-mail","DDoS;Shapley value;botnet detection;click fraud;command and control channel;cooperative game theoretical correlation based model;distributed denial of service;host level detection;mass identity theft;smartphones;spam;trusted hosts","","0","","21","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to the author's knowledge, very few dynamic prioritisation metrics exist. In this paper, a new prioritisation metric - OutMet, which is based on measuring the degree to which an alert belongs to anomalous behaviour is proposed. OutMet combines alert correlation and prioritisation analysis. We illustrate the effectiveness of OutMet by testing its ability to prioritise alerts generated from a 2012 red-team cyber-range experiment that was carried out as part of the BT Saturn programme.

Smartphone technology is more and more becoming the predominant communication tool for people across the world. People use their smartphones to keep their contact data, to browse the internet, to exchange messages, to keep notes, carry their personal files and documents, etc. Users while browsing are also capable of shopping online, thus provoking a need to type their credit card numbers and security codes. As the smartphones are becoming widespread, it's also becoming a popular target for security threats and attack. Since smartphones use the same software architecture as in PCs, they are vulnerable to be exposed to similar threats such as in PCs. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS). Major limitations of smartphone technology are its processing power and its scarce energy source since smartphones rely on battery usage. The smartphones have less storage and computational power to put into effect highly complex algorithms for intrusion detection and implementing signature based attack detection. Now in this paper, we propose a cloud based Intrusion Detection System for smartphones to overcome the issues of smartphone resource constraints and to detect any misbehavior or anomalous activity effectively.","","978-1-4799-6817-6","","10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7193252","Intrusion Detection System;SNORT;Signature Database;Smartphone","Intrusion detection;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Servers;Smart phones","cloud computing;digital signatures;invasive software;smart phones;telecommunication security","Internet browse;cloud based intrusion detection architecture;malware;message exchange;online shopping;signature based security attack detection;smartphone","","0","","21","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many mission-critic sensor network applications demand an effective, light, flexible algorithm for internal adversary identification with only localized information available. The insider attacker detection scheme proposed in this paper meets all the requirements by exploring the spatial correlation existent among the networking behaviors of sensors in close proximity. Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities. Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors. Our algorithm is purely localized, fitting well to the large-scale sensor networks. Simulation results indicate that internal adversaries can be identified with a high accuracy and a low false alarm rate when as many as 25% sensors are misbehaving.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215807","","Authentication;Batteries;Collaborative work;Communication system security;Cryptography;Data security;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attacker detection;cryptography-based techniques;internal adversary identification;large-scale sensor networks;spatial correlation;wireless sensor networks","","41","","30","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IDN is used to capture packets, de-multiplex packets, detect local intrusion and infer intrusion. The IDC is installed in an administration workstation for communicating and managing IDNs, it can also do the intrusion detection and intrusion inferring. The RA consists of several snoop functions for information gathering. After an attack behavior is detected, the RA may launch some kinds of information gathering functions to the attacker, so that the proposed NIDS-SA has the active snoop ability. Furthermore, NIDS-SA includes the functions of the pattern matching and statistical inference.

While introducing duty cycled communications can yield large power savings it does so at the cost of increased delay and decreased throughput. Many WSNs may incorporate several distinct message types of varying priority. A node with a high priority message to send may find the channel to be busy with a lesser priority message from another node and must therefore dasiaback-offpsila leading to further delays. In a multi-hop environment, these delays are compounded and may become unacceptably large. This paper proposes adding a high priority interrupt message to FrameComm that allows a node with important data to send to interrupt another nodepsilas lesser priority transmission giving immediate access to the channel.

Machine learning techniques can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and generate classifiers that are used to detect attacks on computer system. In general the input to classifiers is in a high dimension feature space, but not all features are relevant to the classes to be classified. Feature selection is a very important step in classification since the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features often degrade the performance of classification algorithms both in speed and accuracy. In this paper, we have considered three different approaches for feature selection, Chi square, Information Gain and ReliefF which is based on filter approach.

A self-organizing map (SOM) structure is used for constructing the mathematical model describing normal traffic and anomaly detection. The SOM structure preserves topological mappings between representations. A feature which is desired when classifying normal or intrusive behavior for network data, our hypothesis is that normal traffic representing normal behavior would be clustered around one or more cluster centers and any irregular traffic representing abnormal, and possibly suspicious, behavior would be clustered outside of the normal clustering or inside with high quantization error.

But, the plug-in-and-play architecture of WMNs paves way for malicious users who could exploit some loopholes of the underlying routing protocol. A malicious node can inundate the network by conducting frequent route discovery which severely reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we investigate the detection of route floods by incorporating a machine learning technique. We use a perceptron training model as a tool for intrusion detection. We train the perceptron model by feeding various network statistics and then use it as a classifier.

Such paradigm shift enables to build more manageable, agile and smarter data communication infrastructures. Despite the interest it is deserving on a multitude of physical and virtualized infrastructures, currently there are no systematic approaches of characterizing and comparing alternative SDN-based solutions regarding their resilience -- a characteristic of utmost importance on such critical environments.

For researchers to address these shortcomings, they need methods for evaluating HICHPs. This paper (1) presents an evaluation method called the true positive cost curve (TPCC), which makes it possible to evaluate and compare HICHPs in an operating environment, but also allows an operator to tune HICHPs within a specific operating environment; (2) presents improvements on the way HICHPs visit Web pages and evaluates them with the TPCC method; and (3) discusses the impact of time bombs on the performance of HICHPs in an operating environment and the ability to tune an HICHP for optimal performance with the help of the TPCC.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211044","client honeypot;evaluation;intrusion detection;security","Computer science;Computer security;Cost function;Design engineering;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Weapons;Web pages;Web server","Internet;Web sites;client-server systems;online front-ends;security of data","HICHP;Internet;classification;cost-based evaluation method;dedicated vulnerable Web browser;high-interaction client honeypot;potentially malicious Web page;security device;time bomb;true positive cost curve","","4","","28","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This autonomous topology of MANET makes it vulnerable against the internal attacks, such as black hole, wormhole, and flooding, from inside the system. One existing solution to this problem has been achieved by using Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios. Then a new approach, called Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK), based on NACK and Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is proposed. It is shown that the proposed acknowledgement method outperforms NACK with much less packet overhead, by comparing the results of simulations in Network Simulator v-2.35 (NS-2).","0840-7789","978-1-4799-5827-6","","10.1109/CCECE.2015.7129395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129395","Internal Attacker;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Negative/Selective-Acknowledgement","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Nickel;Protocols;Routing","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;Network Simulator v-2.35;SACK;SNACK method;black hole;independent devices;intrusion detection system;lightweight security monitoring;mobile ad-hoc network;packet delivery;selective acknowledgement;selective-negative acknowledgement algorithm;wormhole","","0","","20","","","3-6 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on information entropy, risk coefficient was defined to describe the whole condition of network security. To forecast the change of risk coefficient, a model was set up according to grey theory. Using a few data, the model can forecast risk coefficient accurately. Simulation and experiments were completed by MATLAB and in LAN. The experiments in LAN prove that information entropy can reflect anomaly traffic caused by DDoS attacks and Internet worms in time and effectively.

In I<sup>2</sup>-DES framework an empowering event ensures that the indicator event sensitizes the failure successfully. We have considered a practical example of Advanced Stealth Man in the Middle attack in Wi-Fi networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed I<sup>2</sup>-DES framework wherein the I-DES framework fails.","","","","10.1109/MED.2015.7158774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158774","ARP Spoofing;Diagnosability;I<sup>2</sup>-DES framework;IDS;Wireless Security","Cryptography;Discrete-event systems;IEEE 802.11 Standards;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Probes;Uncertainty","computer network security;discrete event systems;fault diagnosis;wireless LAN","Advanced Stealth Man detection;DES diagnosability condition;DES diagnoser;DES model;I-DES framework;I-nondiagnosable systems;I<sup>2</sup>-diagnosability framework;Middle Attack;Wi-Fi networks;diagnosability condition;discrete event system model;failure-indeterminate cycles","","0","","12","","","16-19 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ICC '06. IEEE International Conference on","20061211","2006","5","","2388","2393","Anomaly detection is a critical issue in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs). Most anomaly based NIDSs employ supervised algorithms, whose performances highly depend on attack-free training data. However, this kind of training data is difficult to obtain in real world network environment. Moreover, with changing network environment or services, patterns of normal traffic will be changed. This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset. The results show that the proposed approach is comparable to previously reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches evaluated over the KDD' 99 dataset.","8164-9547","1-4244-0355-3","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024522","","Access control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Training data","","","","12","","25","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with new techniques such as SDN come lots of new network security challenges. Conventional network security mechanisms are incompetent to overcome these challenges, since they are built on a static network configuration that facilitates attackers in finding the weaknesses of a network. In this article, we conceive a novel conceptual network security mechanism, the evolving defense mechanism (EDM), to resolve current and future security problems. EDM is based on a bio-inspired idea of network configuration variations. According to the security requirements of the system, the user, and the network security state, EDM selects an efficient network configuration variation strategy to prevent corresponding security threats. Combined with SDN implementation, EDM resolves security problems from a new angle and is capable of evolving with new network security technology. We sketch a way to implement EDM and present its reference framework, which serves as an ecosystem and coexisting environment for various kinds of network configuration variations. The proposed mechanism avoids the deficiency of conventional mechanisms and has potential to cope with emerging security threats.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2015.7081074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081074","","Biological systems;Communication networks;Ecosystmes;IP networks;Network security;Telecommunication network management","Internet;computer network security;software defined networking","EDM;Internet;SDN;bio-inspired idea;coexisting environment;ecosystem;evolving defense mechanism;future network security;network configuration variation strategy;network technology;security threat prevention","","0","","","","","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although coprocessor architectures have been proposed to avoid this security mechanism integrity problem, they either involve the application of non-standard hardware or rely on host-bound application programming interfaces (API). This is why, so far, they are only used in the field of network intrusion detection. In this paper, we present our results concerning a concurrent host memory sampling mechanism based on direct memory access (DMA) and demonstrate that it is possible to de-couple GPU kernel execution, thereby providing temporary isolation from the host and allowing data sampling actions to be taken without interruption. We present a security analysis of our approach and detail a proof-of-concept implementation of the autonomous concurrent monitoring and sampling system, thus, validating that self-sufficient data sampling using a commodity coprocessor (i.e. a GPU) is indeed possible.","","978-1-4673-2244-7","","10.1109/ARES.2012.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6329231","Autonomous GPU Kernels;Coprocessor;Data Sampling;Intrusion detection","Coprocessors;Graphics processing unit;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Kernel","application program interfaces;computerised monitoring;file organisation;graphics processing units;operating system kernels;security of data","API;DMA;GPU coprocessor architectures;GPU kernel execution decoupling;autonomous concurrent monitoring system;autonomous concurrent sampling system;commodity coprocessor;concurrent host memory sampling mechanism;data collection;direct memory access;host intrusion detection systems;host-bound application programming interfaces;mitigation mechanisms;nonstandard hardware;proof-of-concept implementation","","0","","15","","","20-24 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary function of the decision support module is to provide recommended actions and alternatives and the implications of each recommended action. In the decision support module, the GA (genetic algorithm) was run over a subset of the data, called the training data, and then tested over the entire data set to test real-world performance. The model generated by this GA was based on a new method of data analysis for the intrusion detection problem. Each node in the model's decision tree was designed to hold a randomized coefficient for the data, so that this coefficient multiplied by the data would yield a weight for the certainty of whether a certain record was an attack or not. The coefficients were based on ephemeral random constants (ERC), random numbers generated by the GA specific to mathematical modeling.","0840-7789","0-7803-8253-6","","10.1109/CCECE.2004.1349741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1349741","","Application software;Computer displays;Computer science;Computer security;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Training data;Watches","authorisation;computer network management;decision support systems;decision trees;genetic algorithms;random number generation","GA;active detection;automated response support;certainty weight;data analysis;decision support module;decision tree;ephemeral random constants;genetic algorithm;mathematical modeling;network intrusion detection;random number generation;randomized coefficient;real-world performance;training data","","0","","20","","","2-5 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The modified case grammar principal-subordinate consequence tagging case grammar and the 2-atom alert semantic network are used to generate the attack scenario classes. Alert mutual information is also applied to calculate the alert semantic context window size.
