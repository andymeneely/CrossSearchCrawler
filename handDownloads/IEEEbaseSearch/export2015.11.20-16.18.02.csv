The definitions of self, non-self, and immunocyte in the network transactions were first given. Then, with the evolvement of mature detector and immature detector, the real-time network fatalness evaluation equations were built up, which can exactly compute holistic and each network attack of the host and network. Finally, computer forensics was carried out according to the value of real-time network fatalness and attack intensity.

Network performance is sometimes reduced to unacceptable levels due to events such as congestion, equipment failure and information-warfare attacks. A popular solution to these problems is to increase available bandwidth within local area networks and across the wide area network. For the DoD, this option is often unavailable, especially for in-theater forces. It has been demonstrated that quality of service (QoS) policies, created with currently available commercial products, can improve the performance of IP-based networks by orders of magnitude. However, different QoS policies are needed to address specific scenarios such as a particular operational mission, a denial-of-service attack or bandwidth saturation. The network administrator must implement the appropriate QoS policy on an as-needed basis. This paper describes a prototype QoS event manager that automates the process of QoS policy implementation. Based on inputs from network monitoring devices, routers and humans, the QoS event manager selects an appropriate QoS policy and deploys it across the network. We discuss the QoS event manager design and consider issues regarding automated prioritization, tracking and deconfliction of QoS policies.","","0-7803-7225-5","","10.1109/MILCOM.2001.985960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=985960","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Equipment failure;Local area networks;Mission critical systems;Monitoring;Prototypes;Quality management;Quality of service;Wide area networks","computer network management;local area networks;military communication;military computing;quality of service;wide area networks","DoD;IP network;QoS event manager;QoS policies;automated prioritization;automated tracking;bandwidth saturation;congestion;denial-of-service attack;equipment failure;in-theater forces;information-warfare attacks;local area networks;network administrator;network monitoring devices;network performance;quality of service;routers;wide area network","","0","","","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to validate our system's capabilities we evolve a variety of port scan patterns while running the packets through an IDS, with the goal to minimizes the alarms raised during the scanning process.

While several sophisticated systems had been developed in the area of intrusion detection, new challenges arised. Pattern matching systems are not able to cope with high bandwidth (10 Gbps +) when analyzing the whole payload. Furthermore, new attack schemes arise by increasingly complex software and systems. New approaches like network behavior analyses (NBA) systems show promise for being able to cope with the new threats. These systems evaluate statistical flow data generated from the traffic of the monitored network. While originally designed for optimising traffic handling and accounting in the network, flow data appeared to be powerful for intrusion detection. NBA Systems based on machine learning techniques are able to evaluate these data and to recognize anomalies in the network. However, these systems suffer from a long-lasting learning phase and are susceptible to manipulations during that time. To overcome these shortcomings, we are introducing a fast-learning modular neural network based on pre-processed components. For the development of the new system, the possible attacks on NBA systems have to be investigated and understood in depth.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318983","Fast Learning ANN;IDS;Modular Neural Networks;NBA;NetFlow;sFlow","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Pattern matching;Payloads;Software systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern matching;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","NBA system;computer network security;fast-learning modular neural network;intrusion detection;long-lasting learning phase;machine learning technique;monitored network traffic handling;network behavior analysis;network behavior changing;pattern matching system;pre-processed component;statistical flow data","","1","","28","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we develop a mechanism for diagnosing traffic anomalies caused by DDoS attacks on the basis of analyzing the behaviour of network traffic. The traffic in communication networks has been shown to exhibit statistical self-similar phenomena that can be characterized by the so-called Hurst parameter. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the Hurst parameter coupled by variance and autocorrelation are employed as the key performance metrics to spot the anomalies of network traffic. The proposed diagnosis mechanism is validated through experiments where the datasets consist of two groups. The first group is obtained from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset. The second group is collected from our DDoS attack simulation experiments, which cover three representative traffic shapes resulting from three different DDoS attack behaviours, namely, constant intensity, ramp-up behaviour and pulse behaviour. The experimental results show that the developed mechanism can alert the DDoS attack schemes within short respond time.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295984","Anomaly diagnosis;DDoS attack;Intrusion detection;Traffic measurement","Computer crime;Correlation;Data models;Servers;Standards;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack behaviours;DDoS attack simulation experiments;Hurst parameter;MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset;abnormal bursty traffic;constant intensity;distributed denial-of-service attacks;network traffic anomaly;network traffic behaviour analysis;pulse behaviour;ramp-up behaviour;real-time diagnosis;statistical self-similar phenomena;statistical traffic analysis","","3","","18","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This occurs because the normal behavior data obtained through training on one machine cannot be used for detection on another machine. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system that shares normal behavior data between multiple machines. In the proposed system, normal behavior data obtained on each machine is accumulated in a server and the integrated data is distributed to each machine.This system improves the detection accuracy by integrating the data used for anomaly detection on each machine. The proposed system not only provides a straightforward algorithm for integration, but also two improved algorithms, namely, the majority algorithm and the similarity algorithm.

For instance, MANET is riddled by issues like unreliability of wireless media, uncertain connectivity, host mobility and lack of infrastructure. However, perhaps, a most important aspect of such networks is the problem of security. The computational load and complexity involved in this environment are strongly subject to the dynamic nature of network topology, especially the restriction by the node's available resources. Therefore, key management and authentication are a central aspect for security in MANET and thus they should not be weak. For such small-scale networks, we propose here a security architecture utilizing a seniority-based trust model and PGP type certification service by building a specific PKI. Related algorithms are also presented. The performance of this new model is evaluated through simulation. The model should find wide applicability because it is simple, easy to deploy, efficient, and more secure and reliable than other existing solutions in the literature.","","978-1-4244-2427-6","","10.1109/ISBAST.2008.4547670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4547670","MANET;PGP;PKI","Authentication;Buildings;Certification;Communication system security;Computer networks;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Telecommunication computing;Telecommunication network topology","ad hoc networks;computational complexity;cryptography;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET dynamic topology;certification service;computational complexity;computational load;hybrid cryptography model;key authentication;key management;security management;seniority-based trust model;small-scale networks;trust model;uncertain connectivity;wireless media","","1","","12","","","23-24 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For overcome this problem we present in this paper we proposed a novel parallel processing inspection model which is called CMRDS (Centralized multiple robust distribution system). This implies balanced parallel detection by adding multiple dimensions on pattern matching workload division from various different types of nodes. CMRDS allows multiple pattern matching algorithm and creates simultaneously different pattern set and handle variable pattern length efficiently for packet inspection is completed in O(N log M) and N is the size of the packet M is the longest packet length inspect packet for optimizing flow in the different network.

Our approach incorporates two types of detectors: binary and real-valued. Relatively short binary receptors are used for primary detection, while the real valued detectors are used to resolve eventual doubts. Such a hybrid solution is much more economical in comparison with ldquopurerdquo approaches. The binary detectors are more faster than real-valued ones, what allows minimize computationally and timely complex operations on real values.

Regular expressions are one method to implement such matching and are often built in FPGAs using non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs). To obtain high throughputs it is necessary to process many bytes in parallel. This paper extends the modular NFA construction method of Sidhu and Prasanna to handle the processing of many bytes in parallel. The paper also introduces the concept of partial character decoding in which character match units are shared but the number of signals needed to be routed around the FPGA is reduced over previous shared-decoder approaches. With these approaches, throughput over 5Gbps is achieved for the full default Snort rule-set (23401 literals) in a Xilinx Virtex-2 6000 FPGA. Throughputs over 40Gbps are achieved on smaller rule-sets.

L-WMxD , which works on a lexical based mutation engine, is an active defense system to discover XSS before the Webmail application is online for service. The engine is initialized by normal JavaScript code called seed. Then, rules are applied to the sensitive strings in the seed which are picked out through a lexical parser. After that, the mutation engine issues multiple test cases. Newly-generated test cases are used for XSS test. Two prototype tools are realized by us to send the newly-generated test cases to various Webmail servers to discover XSS vulnerability. Experimental results of L-WMxD are quite encouraging.

We apply our tool to Linux kernel 2.4.32 and identify 141,279 global invariants that are critical to its runtime integrity. Furthermore, comparison with the result of a dynamic invariant detector reveals 17,182 variables that can cause false alarms for the dynamic detector.

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

The framework includes author behavior categories, which are the set of characteristics that remain relatively constant for a large number of messages written by the author. Specific topics include user pattern analysis, user profiling, categorization, computational linguistics, data mining, and anomaly detection. The experiments focus on applying character frequency analysis to IM messages for authorship identification and validation. This addresses the questions; can we identify an author of an IM conversation based strictly on user behavior, do different conversations with a single user look similar, do conversations with different users look different, and what is the demarcation between similar and different? Another experiment focuses on applying an instance-based learning algorithm to the character frequency of IM user messages for authorship identification and validation. The experiment applies the nearest-neighbor classification method to classify messages. It also calculates a degree of confidence to validate the identity of the IM user","","1-4244-0174-7","","10.1109/CCST.2006.313445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4105332","","Communication effectiveness;Computer crime;Data mining;Forensics;Frequency;Humans;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Social network services;Writing","Internet;authorisation;electronic messaging;learning systems;pattern classification;telecommunication security","anomaly detection;author profiling;authorship identification;authorship validation;character frequency analysis;computational linguistics;data mining;instance-based learning;instant messaging;intrusion detection system;nearest-neighbor classification;user behavior;user categorization;user pattern analysis;user profiling","","2","","16","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

People have increasingly attached importance to research on software testing management method. The current main problem in software testing management research is how to effectively manage the whole software testing process. Through research on V Model and W Model in software testing management, these models have themselves inherent limitations and are largely impractical. Reflective architectures are used to allow a software system to define its behavior at runtime based on information that can be stored in metadata. This paper proposes RATMM - reflective architecture based software testing management model. The model integrates reflection theory and software architecture design method, constructed software testing management model by using meta-information theory and meta-model method. RATMM is logically divided into meta-level and base-level. Meta-level and base-level are interrelated. Meta object captures condition and behavior of base-level, meta-level makes the corresponding metacomputing. Meta-level reflects the changes in meta-information to base-level after computing. Based on the description of its own condition and behavior, RATMM can adjust the testing process, obtain information about structure and behavior of testing process, and build software testing management model by reflective architecture. The model allows the user to modify condition of a software testing process without programming. RATMM exists in the entire testing life cycle, as well as verifies and confirms the whole process of the system","","1-4244-0147-X","1-4244-0148-8","10.1109/ICMIT.2006.262335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4037133","","Application software;Computer architecture;Design methodology;Internet;Metacomputing;Reflection;Runtime;Software architecture;Software systems;Software testing","program testing;software architecture;software management","Internet;RATMM model;V Model;W Model;meta-information theory;meta-model method;reflection theory;reflective architecture based software testing management model;software architecture design method","","0","","14","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.","","","","10.1109/EAIT.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032","Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node","Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV","data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing","CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack","","0","","18","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module. We present the models capability to further calculate the power consumption of individual applications given measurements, and also the feasibility of our model to operate in real-time and without significant impact in the power footprint of the devices we monitor.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","","10.1109/SERE.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258304","energy model;power usage measurements;smart handheld devices","Brightness;Discharges (electric);Image color analysis;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Power demand;Power measurement","","","","12","","20","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes use a trust based transmission method based on previous records of successful packet transmission. Nodes which violate this relay of packets and cause denial of service attack in the form flooding of large packets may cause congestion which needs to be detected. Whenever congestion occurs then the senders should lower their transmission rate, but if certain senders do not do this, it can be found by the destination by comparing it with the previous sending rate. When both the rates are equal, the corresponding sender is considered as an attacker and has to be removed from the existing path. Such type of node is continuously sending the control and data packets in the network, hindering the connection establishment. An adaptive approach is proposed which involves taking an alternate path to the destination which is less congested in order to complete the message transfer.","2347-9337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012833","Congestion;flooding;wireless network","Conferences;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;trusted computing","adaptive approach;denial of service attack;distributed detection;infrastructureless wireless network;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;packet flooding;trust based transmission method","","0","","10","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distinguishing different anomaly patterns from large amount of data can be a challenge, let alone visualizing them in a comparative perspective. Recently, the unsupervised learning method such as the K-means [3], self-organizing map (SOM) [2], and growing hierarchical self-organizing map (GHSOM) [1] have been shown to be able to facilitate network anomaly detection [4][5]. However, there is no study addressing both mining and detecting task. This study leverages the advantage of GHSOM to analyze the network traffic data and visualize the distribution of attack patterns with hierarchical relationship. In the mining stage, the geometric distances between each pattern and its descriptive information are revealed in the topological space. The density and the sample size of each node can help to detect anomalous network traffic. In the detecting stage, this study extends the traditional GHSOM and uses the support vector machine (SVM) [6] to classify network traffic data into the predefined categories. The proposed approach achieves (1) help understand the behaviors of anomalous network traffic data (2) provide effective classification rule to facilitate network anomaly detection and (3) accumulate network anomaly detection knowledge for both mining and detecting purpose. The public dataset and the private dataset are used to evaluate the proposed approach. The expected result is to confirm that the proposed approach can help understand network traffic data, and the detecting mechanism is effective for identifying anomalous behavior.","1530-0889","978-1-4673-6471-3","","10.1109/DSN.2013.6575338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575338","Data Classification;Data Clustering;Network anomaly detection;Neural networks;Visualization","Data mining;Data visualization;Feature extraction;Forensics;Neural networks;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;self-organising feature maps;support vector machines;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","GHSOM;K-means method;SVM;anomalous network traffic detection;geometric distances;hierarchical SOM;hierarchical self-organizing map;network traffic anomaly detection;network traffic data analysis;pattern detection;public dataset;support vector machine;unsupervised learning method","","1","","6","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging as a prevailing technology due to its wide range of applications in military and civilian domains. These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency. In this paper multipath routing scheme is used as defense mechanism against selective forwarding attack. When a node detects packet drop during the routing, it will resend the packet through alternate route. Due to the resending mechanism reliability of the routing scheme is improved.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726833","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Reliability;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","defense mechanism;multipath routing;packet drop detection;routing reliability;security attack;selective forwarding attack;selective packet dropping;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in a cloud, for example, compromsing an easy-to-exploit machine in the cloud and then using the compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from the cloud and extracts the intensions of the actions recorded in the logs. Stealthy reconnaissance actions are often neglected by administrator for the insignificant number of violations. Hidden Markov model is adopted to model the steps of the attack plan performed by hacker and such stealthy events in a long time frame will become significant in the state-aware model.

Misuse detectors attempt detection by matching the current system/user activity against known signatures and patterns. As opposed to this, anomaly detection works by developing a reference graph and comparing the ongoing activity against it. Any significant deviation is flagged as an intrusion. Anomaly detection is more promising because of its potential to detect unseen types of attacks. However, both techniques have conventionally relied on audit trails sampled deep inside the system via probes and the sheer size of the data allows only after-the-fact and off line detection. In recent past, there have been efforts to capture the semantics of system activity for more rapid detection and this can typically be done at levels closer to the user. In our earlier works related to this effort, we presented a scheme and a reasoning framework to detect intrusions based on the encapsulated user intent. This paper addresses the scalability and implementation aspects of the system by introducing concepts such as workspaces and meta-operations. Although this security system is a general anomaly detection system, it is amenable to operator fault recovery. While encryption provides secure communication channels, it leaves the end points exposed.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) encompass one field of classification that has proven to yield high accuracy and has recently seen increased widespread use, however, the required computational intensity places a challenge on computer architects to design a hardware structure capable of performing real-time classifications while maintaining low power consumption. This paper proposes the first ever fully pipelined, floating point based, multi-use reconfigurable hardware architecture designed to act in conjunction with embedded processing as an accelerator for multiclass SVM classification. Several tasks, involving an extensive sample set of over 100,000 classifications, are evaluated for speed and accuracy against the same suite running on both an Intel Core i7-2600 system with lib SVM and an Nvidia GT 750M graphics card GPU.

Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%.

Many clustering algorithms have been proposed. However, most of them implicitly assume that nodes behave honestly in the clustering process. In practice, there might be some malicious nodes trying to manipulate the clustering process to make them serve as clusterheads, which can obtain some special power, e.g., eavesdropping more messages. In this paper we present a secure weighted clustering algorithm (SWCA). SWCA uses the weighted clustering algorithm (WCA) for clustering and TELSA for efficiently authenticating packets. We propose a novel neighbor verification scheme to check whether the values of election-related features (e.g., node degree) are forged by malicious nodes. Also, we theoretically analyze the probability for a malicious node to tamper node degree without being detected and derive a lower bound on the probability. Finally, simulation results show that SWCA is secure but still has comparable performance with WCA. To the best of our knowledge, SWCA is the first algorithm considering the security of 1-hop type clustering (in this type only the clusterhead can communicate with ordinary members directly) in ad hoc networks.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-2947-9","978-1-4244-2948-6","10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4917979","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Clustering algorithms;Communications Society;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Security;Software algorithms","ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","QoS;ad hoc networks;broadcasting;malicious node probability;packet authentication;routing;secure weighted clustering algorithm;wireless ad hoc networks","","1","","26","","","5-8 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the detection protocol, different nodes play different roles, and use different monitor schemes. Virtual cluster head and monitor nodes are elected. Monitor nodes monitor cluster head, and report to virtual cluster head. Virtual cluster head broadcasts abnormal cluster head to all member nodes, and initiates a new cluster head election. Member nodes are monitored by their cluster head. Simulation shows that, the detection protocol can real-time predict traffic attacks, and consume less energy.

In adhoc networks, routes may be disconnected due to dynamic movement of nodes. So, route selection and topology combination is very difficult and challenging issue. Such networks are more vulnerable to both internal and external attacks due to presence of bad neighbor nodes. Observed problem affects performance of routing protocol in adhoc networks. In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network. Besides, this approach is extended by adding extra parameters i.e. signal strength, flow capacity and relative position of a node in to the account.

Unfortunately, system administrators neither can keep up with the pace that an IDS is delivering alerts, nor can they react upon these within adequate time limits. Automatic response systems have to take over that task. In case of an identified intrusion, these components have to initiate appropriate actions to counter emerging threats. Most current intrusion response systems (IRSs) utilize static mappings to determine adequate response actions in reaction to detected intrusions. The problem with this approach is its inherent inflexibility. Countermeasures (such as changes of firewall rules) often do not only defend against the detected attack but may also have negative effects on legitimate users of the network and its services. To prevent a situation where a response action causes more damage that the actual attack, a mechanism is needed that compares the severity of an attack to the effects of a possible response mechanism. In this paper, we present a network model and an algorithm to evaluate the impact of response actions on the entities of a network. This allows the IRS to select the response among several alternatives which fulfills the security requirements and has a minimal negative effect on legitimate users.","1063-9527","0-7695-1828-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176302","","Computer bugs;Computer security;Counting circuits;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Watches;Web and internet services","security of data","IDS;IRS;automated intrusion response mechanism impact evaluation;countermeasures;emerging threats;firewall rules;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response systems;system administrators","","19","","15","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article presents the application of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), through Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG), for the problem of optimization of selection of test cases for testing computing systems that are based on intelligent agents. In order to validate the use of CLONALG, comparisons between the Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms (ACO) techniques were performed. In the experiments with the approach testing intelligent agents with different types of architecture in partially and completely observable environments, the approach selected a group of satisfactory test cases in terms of the generated information about the irregular performance of the agent.

Significant research efforts have been made to address the problem of misbehavior detection. However, little research work has been done to distinguish truly malicious behaviors from the faulty behaviors. Both the malicious behaviors and the faulty behaviors are generally equally treated as misbehaviors without any further investigation by most of the traditional misbehavior detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose and develop a policy-based malicious peer detection mechanism, in which context information, such as communication channel status, buffer status, and transmission power level, is collected and then used to determine whether the misbehavior is likely a result of malicious activity or not. Simulation results illustrate that the policy-based malicious peer detection mechanism is able to distinguish malicious peers from faulty peers with high confidence.

Since security as well as privacy play an increasingly important role in these contexts, sensor nodes and sensor networks need to be protected from spurious environmental effects and malicious attacks. In addition to attacks known from conventional wireless networks, the specific properties of WSNs lead to new kinds of attack. Moreover, countermeasures are subject to strict resource limitations of the motes and, therefore, have to be light-weight and effective at the same time. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive security architecture for WSNs, consisting of different attack types (including WSN-specific attacks) and countermeasures.

Through extensive simulation, four performance parameters, namely, detection rate, false positive rate, detection delay, and communication overhead are evaluated.","","978-1-4244-5175-3","978-1-4244-5176-0","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421824","","Authentication;Communication system security;Communications Society;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Multimedia systems;Nominations and elections;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","CCIDS;court-like cluster-based IDS;intrusion detection system;link deletion;link spoofing;mobile ad hoc networks;one-hop clusters;optimized link state routing protocol security","","0","","6","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the context of work carried on standards for online laboratories we pretend define methods for storing and retrieving learning objects for remote laboratories. The objective of this standard is also define methods for linking learning objects to design and implement smart learning environments and software components or objets for remote online laboratories The objects defined by this standard are, for example, interfaces for devices connected to user computers over computers networks and the devices themselves. They are also learning scenarios or collaboration tools for communications necessary to conduct an activity of practical online laboratory work, they will allow to design and implement mechanisms that make smart learning environment formed by the ad hoc aggregation of learning objects taking always into account the pedagogical context for their use. This will allow to easy design and implement the pedagogically driven remote laboratory environment and experiments as also is learning environments. The experiences and laboratories are build using the parts and separate components that we have in a separate “virtual closet” with parts, components, and already build experiences. To build this complex network we need to find a system that supports effectively this structure. This probably will be an enormous database of v-labs and independent elements, where will be possible sometimes to “recycle” some of the elements. For this structure we propose an Ontology because it allows to “re-use” the same element several times in m- ny experiences, and provide a very detailed description of each kind of element through is classes and sub-classes.","2165-9559","978-1-4673-6111-8","978-1-4673-6109-5","10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530257","CMS;E-learning;Ontology;Remote Laboratory;V-labs;Virtual Labs;distributed instrumentation","Business;Ontologies;Remote laboratories;Semantic Web;Standards;User interfaces","complex networks;computer aided instruction;computer networks;information retrieval;laboratory techniques;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","collaboration tools;complex network;computer networks;learning object retrieval;learning object storage;online experiences;ontology based online laboratory;pedagogical context;pedagogically driven remote laboratory environment;practical online laboratory work;remote online laboratories;smart learning environments;software components;user computers;v-labs database;virtual closet;virtual laboratory network","","0","","37","","","13-15 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, existing parallel schemes often fail to achieve linear speedup in IDS. The throughput even deteriorates severely for some network traffics. Hence, exploring and addressing the problems have become one of the most urgent issues in parallel IDS. In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system. Second, we propose a new fingerprint extraction strategy to deal with HRF. Experimental results show that the throughput deterioration is resolved completely and the throughput is enhanced by 45% by integrating our proposed method into the test bed and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120879","Intrusion Detection System;Snort;multi-core;pre-fliter;software pipeline","","","","","0","","20","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of IPsec, which encrypts network traffic, renders network intrusion detection virtually useless unless traffic is decrypted at network gateways. Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) can provide some of the functionality of NIDSs but with limitations. HIDSs cannot perform a network-wide analysis and can be subverted if a host is compromised. We propose an approach to intrusion detection that combines HIDS, NIDS, and a version of IPsec that encrypts the header and the body of IP packets separately (""Two-Zone IPsec""). We show that all of the network events currently detectable by the Snort NIDS on unencrypted network traffic are also detectable on encrypted network traffic using this approach. The NIDS detects network-level events that HIDSs have trouble detecting and HIDSs detect application-level events that can't be detected by the NIDS.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455095","","Cryptography;Electrostatic precipitators;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Pattern matching;Payloads;Performance analysis;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","","","","0","","22","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our algorithm uses a semiglobal alignment and a unique scoring system to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder and the user signature, which is a sequence of commands collected from a legitimate user.

The IDS to accomplish its function must, in some way, to guarantee reliability and availability to its own application, so that it gets to give continuity to the services even in case of faults, mainly faults caused by malicious agents. This paper proposes an adaptive fault tolerance mechanism for network intrusion detection system based on intelligent agents. We propose the creation of a society of agents that monitors a system to collect information related to agents and hosts. Using the information which is collected, it is possible: to detect which agents are still active; which agents should be replicated and which strategy should be used. The process of replication depends on each type of agent, and its importance to the system at different moments of processing. We use some agents as sentinels for monitoring and thus allowing us to accomplish some important tasks such load balancing, migration, and detection of malicious agents, to guarantee the security of the proper IDS","","0-7695-2560-1","","10.1109/SEUS-WCCIA.2006.4","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1611713","","Availability;Face detection;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Information security;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Load management;Monitoring;Protection","computer networks;fault tolerant computing;information retrieval;multi-agent systems;security of data","authorization;fault tolerance;information retrieval;intelligent agents;network intrusion detection system;security","","2","","16","","","27-28 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power while switching of gates and reduces the wiring-crises. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that makes use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an approach using artificial intelligence technique with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918856","digital world;electronic circuit;rough set","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Artificial intelligence;Educational institutions;Electronic circuits;Logic gates;Set theory","logic gates;rough set theory","artificial intelligence based approach;circuit miniaturization;decision rules;electronic circuit;rough set theory","","0","","7","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many recent new services are based on cloud environments, and a lot of people are using cloud networks. Since many diverse hosts and network configurations coexist in a cloud network, it is essential to protect each of them in the cloud network from threats. To do this, basically, we can employ existing network security devices, but applying them to a cloud network requires more considerations for its complexity, dynamism, and diversity. In this paper, we propose a new framework, CloudWatcher, which provides monitoring services for large and dynamic cloud networks. This framework automatically detours network packets to be inspected by pre-installed network security devices. In addition, all these operations can be implemented by writing a simple policy script, thus, a cloud network administrator is able to protect his cloud network easily. We have implemented the proposed framework, and evaluated it on different test network environments.","","978-1-4673-2445-8","978-1-4673-2446-5","10.1109/ICNP.2012.6459946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459946","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing;Security;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer network security","CloudWatcher framework;OpenFlow;cloud computing;cloud environment;cloud network administrator;dynamic cloud network;network packet;network security device;network security monitoring;policy script;security monitoring-as-a-service","","10","","17","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a new algorithm for the correlation of alerts generated by Network Intrusion Detection Systems. It is specifically oriented to face multistep attacks where multiple intrusion activities belonging to the same attack scenario are performed within a small time window. This algorithm takes as its input the security alerts generated by a NIDS and, through a pseudo-bayesian alert correlation, is able to identify those that are likely to belong to the same multistep attack scenario. The proposed approach is completely unsupervised and applicable to security alerts generated by any kind of NIDS.","","978-1-4577-1034-6","","10.1109/CSS.2011.6058565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058565","","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Indexes;Intrusion detection","computer crime;computer network security","NIDS;correlated network intrusion alert;false alarm;information systems attack;pseudoBayesian alert correlation","","2","","12","","","8-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An Efficient Parallelized L7-Filter Design for Multicore Servers","Danhua Guo; Bhuyan, L.N.; Bin Liu","Microsoft Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on","20121011","2012","20","5","1426","1439","L7-filter is a significant deep packet inspection (DPI) extension to Netfilter in Linux's QoS framework. It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","1","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Failure of any sub-system to properly defend itself against attacks poses a serious risk to the protection of smart grid as a whole. Therefore, securing residential demand response (DR) applications as part of the smart grid requires careful attention. This paper discusses security concerns of a specific DR implementation: the Home Energy Management (HEM) system developed at Virginia Tech (VT). The paper identifies possible security attacks against its various key components, and presents best practices for the counter-measure against those attacks. Privacy issues have also been addressed using access control methods.

However, when the user remote login the UNIX system, the login packets that contain private messages such as account and password easily captured and cracked by the hackers because they are transmitting in the network without encryption. Firstly, we review the main principle of packet capture technology. Then to aim at UNIX remote login packet, we give a detailed case to illustrate the whole process to invade UNIX successfully. The process consists of following steps: how to use packet capture technology to capture it illegally in the network, how to further analysis its' frame structure, how to obtain the secret information without user authorization by deciphering it.

Good digital evidence is becoming a business enabler. Very few organizations have the structures (management and infrastructure) in place to enable them to conduct cost effective, low-impact and efficient digital investigations [1]. Digital Forensics (DF) is a vehicle that organizations use to provide good and trustworthy evidence and processes. The current DF models concentrate on reactive investigations, with limited reference to DF readiness and live investigations. However, organizations use DF for other purposes for example compliance testing. The paper proposes that DF consists of three components: Pro-active (ProDF), Active (ActDF) and Re-active (ReDF). ProDF concentrates on DF readiness and the proactive responsible use of DF to demonstrate good governance and enhance governance structures. ActDF considers the gathering of live evidence during an ongoing attack with a limited live investigation element whilst ReDF deals with the traditional DF investigation.
