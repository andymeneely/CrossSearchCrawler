Black hole attacks are potentially devastating attacks on wireless sensor networks in which a malicious node uses spurious route updates to attract network traffic that it then drops. We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic. We examine the resource-preserving mechanisms of our system using simulations and demonstrate that we can allow groups of nodes to collectively evaluate network traffic and identify attacks while respecting the limited hardware resources (processing, memory and storage) that are typically available on wireless sensor network nodes.","","","","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835013","","Cryptography;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","autonomous self-organizing low-power nodes;black hole attacks;flexible attack detection scheme;lightweight expert system;malicious node;network traffic;node-resident expert systems;resource-preserving mechanisms;spurious route updates;watchdog mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","0","","20","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since it seems impossible to guarantee complete protection to a system by means of the ""classical"" prevention mechanisms, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems has emerged as a key element in network security. In this paper we address the problem considering some techniques for detecting network anomalies. Our approach is based on the use of different compression algorithms for detecting anomalies in the network traffic running over TCP. In more detail we take into account the use of three different compression algorithms, based on distinct approaches, namely: Huffman coding, Dynamic Markov Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. The proposed methods are based on the consideration that the entropy represents a lower bound to the compression rate that we can obtain, and that the more redundant the data are and the better we can compress them. The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199270","","Communications Society;Compression algorithms;Cryptography;Data security;Entropy;Huffman coding;Image coding;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection","Internet;Markov processes;encoding;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Huffman coding;Internet;Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm;TCP;compression algorithms;dynamic Markov coding;intrusion detection systems;network anomaly detection;network security;network traffic;security attacks","","0","","19","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection model in which we combine a newly proposed genetic based feature selection algorithm and an existing Fuzzy Support Vector Machines (SVM) for effective classification as a solution. The feature selection reduces the number of features by removing unimportant features, hence reducing runtime. Moreover, when the Fuzzy SVM classifier is used with the reduced feature set, it improves the detection accuracy.

This paper proposes the application of a genetic algorithm to estimate the location of such malicious nodes. Simulation results show that with nine anchor nodes in a 1 km by 1 km area, the algorithm is capable of estimating the intruderpsilas position within a radius of 45 meters in 60% of the cases.

Traditional MAS-based distributed IDSs commonly do their detection work within a framework that employs the method of distributed data collection and hierarchical data analysis. This is a simple and strict method, but it restricts the characteristic of distributing, intelligence and real-time response badly.

The lack of mechanisms for management frame authentication and the complexity of the protocol itself have derived into a considerable number of denial of service and identity spoofing attacks. As most denial of service attacks are based on spoofing of MAC addresses, spoofed frame detection schemes have gained attentions. Currently the most efficient techniques to detect this kind of attacks are based on the creation of profiles for the wireless nodes and behavior based protocol anomaly detection. However, these techniques tend to generate too many of false positives. This is caused by the unstable nature of the wireless medium and also because of the difficulty to model the behaviour of the diverse implementations from different manufacturers. One way to reduce false positives is to combine different techniques to carry out the analysis. We propose a novel method that identifies the impersonation of certain management frames, which helps to reduce the number of false positives within other existing MAC spoofing detection techniques.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529384","802.11 MAC address spoofing;false positive","Authentication;Availability;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer science education;Computer security;Identity management systems;Intrusion detection;Personal digital assistants;Protocols","access protocols;computational complexity;message authentication;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 network;beacon MAC frame spoofing attack detection;management frame authentication;protocol","","1","","26","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network traffic sample is considered an anomaly if its abstract feature falls on the outside of the fitting envelope. We justify the effectiveness of the presented approach against 150000+ traffic samples from the NSL-KDD dataset in training and testing, demonstrating positive promise in detecting network attacks by identifying samples that have abnormal features.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280573","incremental learning;intrusion detection system;neural networks;outlier detection","Adaptation models;Character recognition;Classification algorithms;Testing","computer network security;data structures;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","NSL-KDD dataset;abnormal features;anomaly behavior;data abstraction;dynamic changing environment;fitting envelopes;incremental majority learning;intrusion detection systems;iterative evolutions;large network traffic data;network attacks;network-traffic anomaly detection;unsupervised learning","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One method uses hidden Markov model to check reflector DoS attacks, another based on adaptive resonance theory, which can learn the normal behavior with unsupervised method. The advantages of the methods are that they donpsilat need attack signatures and can detect intrusion in real-time.

This dependence of modern societies on the Internet has also resulted in more criminals using the Internet for their purposes, causing a steady increase of attacks, both in terms of quantity as well as quality. Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible. To overcome this shortcoming we present a new behavior-based detection architecture that uses similarity measurements to detect intrusions as well as insider activities like data exfiltration in encrypted environments.","0163-6804","","","10.1109/MCOM.2014.6852093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6852093","","Encryption;Internet;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Payloads;Telecommunication network management","Internet;computer network security;cryptography","Internet;behavior-based intrusion detection;data exfiltration;encrypted communication;encrypted environments;malicious activity detection","","0","","","","","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite many of these machine learning approaches have achieved the goal of getting high accuracy levels in a more automatic way, the fact is that only a few of them have actually been deployed on real life scenarios. This could be explained if we take into consideration that some of the assumptions in which these techniques rely on, do not easily hold. Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels. Prototype relays on a hybrid detection and evolutionary summarizing schemes The viability of the two schemes has been confirmed trough experiments considering different attack distributions and types.","","978-1-4799-1426-5","","10.1109/IDAACS.2013.6663006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663006","Genetic Algorithms;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Sociology;Statistics","computer network security;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","attack distributions;attack types;evolutionary summarizing scheme;human effort reduction;hybrid detection scheme;machine learning techniques;network intrusion detection;network traffic model generation;prototype relays","","0","","13","","","12-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely ""attack signature"", resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper we propose an intrusion detection method that proposes rough set based feature selection heuristics and using fuzzy ants for clustering data. Rough set has to decrease the amount of data and get rid of redundancy. Fuzzy ants clustering methods allow objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership.

When present, the intruder chooses how to corrupt the data. The second type models virus attacks.

To overcome this bottleneck, today's network processors can utilize a wide-range of mechanisms - such as multi-level memory hierarchy, wide-word accesses, special-purpose result-caches, asynchronous memory, and hardware multi-threading. However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.","","978-1-59593-082-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260","data-caches;multithreading;network processors","Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput","internetworking;multi-threading","asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses","","6","3","42","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper reviews different approaches of node localization discovery in wireless sensor networks. Intrusion detection in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is of practical interest in many applications such as detecting an intruder in a battlefield.

Another interesting but more resource and time consuming playground is made available thanks to high interaction honeypots where a blackhat can connect to the system and download, install and execute his own tools in a less constrained environment. Once caught in the honeypot, the blackhat leaves many fingerprints behind: network (information gathering scans, IRC chats, mail, etc) and system activity (what he did on the system, which tools he used, etc). The aim of honeypot forensics is to identify these fingerprints as part of the evidence gathering process. We present a methodology that will help the analyst to achieve this goal. The first step is to analyze the honeypot's ingress and egress network traffic. The second one is to look at the actions performed by the blackhat and the tools he used on the honeypot. The next step is to correlate these data: network and system events are joined to identify common events or patterns, and also to highlight unexplained items and focus on them.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437793","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437793","","Event detection;Fingerprint recognition;Forensics;Humans;IP networks;Local area networks;Marine animals;Postal services;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","egress network traffic;evidence gathering process;fingerprint identification;honeypot forensics;network event;system event","","5","","11","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One difficult class of attack to defend against is user-initiated malicious software (malware) execution. User-initiated malware penetrates the security perimeter with assistance provided, either intentionally or unintentionally, by and enterprise's end users. These users assist the attacker by downloading malware from a Web site, invoking malware arriving as e-mail attachments and introducing malware inside the perimeter via the unauthorized use of foreign media, e.g., floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or unauthorized media devices, e.g., USB drives, or unauthorized wireless networking hardware. In this paper, we describe characteristics of the most widely used defense techniques for the blocking of user-initiated malware and why these techniques are insufficient. We then introduce a module verification strategy that eliminates, or at least severely reduce, this problem by extending the classic ""defense in depth"" network security strategy. We then describe how the augmentation of a standard operating system loader to include references to a database of cryptographic hashes of module executables can be used to implement this strategy.

Virtualization has a key role in supporting the IaaS model. However, virtualization also makes it a target for potent rootkits because of the loss of control problem over the hosted Virtual Machines (VMs). This makes traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operating system kernel trustworthiness, no longer an effective solution to secure the virtual infrastructure of the IaaS model. In this paper, we explore briefly the security problem of the IaaS cloud computing model, and present CloudSec, a new virtualization-aware monitoring appliance that provides active, transparent and real-time security monitoring for hosted VMs in the IaaS model. CloudSec utilizes virtual machine introspection techniques to provide fine-grained inspection of VM's physical memory without installing any monitoring code inside the VM. It actively reconstructs and monitors the dynamically changing kernel data structures instances, as a prior step to enable providing protection for kernel data structures. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype using VMsafe libraries on a VMware ESX platform.

However, anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often provide such low-level, difficult to comprehend information. This paper details a Human Interface for Security Awareness (HISA) algorithm for interpreting cyber incident information to human operators from anomaly based intrusion detections systems. A similarity algorithm mapping anomaly results to signature based intrusion system rules is developed. Categorizations of attacks found in rules created for the Snort intrusion system were used as a basis of information to present to the user. A proof of concept system was developed using Perl native functions and custom modules. Testing with generated ICMP packets resulted in an identification accuracy of 60% proving the efficacy of the presented HISA algorithm.","","978-1-4244-3959-1","978-1-4244-3960-7","10.1109/HSI.2009.5091055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5091055","command and control systems;site security monitoring","Communication system control;Communication system security;Computer security;Control systems;Humans;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Safety","digital signatures;security of data;traffic information systems;user interfaces","cyber security anomaly detection system;digital signature;human interface;intrusion detection system;network traffic information system;security awareness;snort intrusion system;user interface","","1","","18","","","21-23 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transmittance contrast between the x- and y-polarized modes reaches 31.9 dB, which is sensitive enough to monitor any polarization state change in the fiber. A pressure sensor with the sensitivity of 0.25 rad/N is thus demonstrated. The corresponding stress-optic coefficient of the fiber is measured at 1550-nm telecomm band.

Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. The host based systems as well as the network based systems have their own limitations. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present NIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces some significant problems contained by the previous systems such as trust issues and message spreading problems. In the proposed IDS we donpsilat need to install the system for every host. That reduces the system overhead to a reasonable extent.

Due to its architecture, it suffers from various types of denial of service attacks like collision attacks, packet dropping and misdirection. Denial of Service attacks affects the availability of network and prevents legal nodes to use the network services.

Engineers revise agent implementations and face the challenge to comprehend, validate and finally predict the resulting system-level behaviors. In this paper we discuss the usage of simulation models to assist engineers in examining MAS dynamics. Particularly, we show how stochastic transition systems can be inferred from agent implementations. The resulting models allow engineers to explore the stochastic processes that may underly agent designs, facilitating both system design and validation as well as system optimization.

Early work in MANET research has mainly focused on developing an efficient routing mechanism in such a highly dynamic and resource-constrained network. At present, several efficient routing protocols have been proposed for MANET. Most of these protocols assume a trusted and cooperative environment. However, in the presence of malicious nodes, the networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. In MANET, routing attacks are particularly serious.

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule. Through the careful co-design and optimization of our architecture with a new string matching algorithm we show that it is possible to build a system that is 10 times more efficient than the currently best known approaches.","1063-6897","0-7695-2270-X","","10.1109/ISCA.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431550","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Databases;Heart;Intrusion detection;Network-on-a-chip;Protection;Throughput","computer architecture;optimisation;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","network chips;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;network security;network speed;string matching architecture;wireless device","","16","30","31","","","4-8 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless image sensor networks, some monitoring quality loss may be tolerated since visual information retrieved from source nodes may have different relevance for the application, according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors' poses and fields of view. Based on such sensing relevancies, we propose an energy-efficient visual monitoring mechanism where the frequency of image snapshots transmitted by each source node will be a function of the monitoring relevance of the node for the application. Doing so, we achieve energy saving over the active paths as lower relevant source nodes will transmit fewer images in a period of time, but with low impact to the monitoring functions of the application since sufficient information is still received from the most relevant source nodes.

Advancements in sensor networks enable a wide range of environmental monitoring and object tracking applications. Secure routing in sensor networks is a difficult problem due to the resources limitations in WSN. Moreover, multihop routing in WSN is affected by new nodes constantly entering/leaving the system. Therefore, biologically inspired algorithms are reviewed and enhanced to tackle problems arise in WSN. Ant routing and human security has shown an excellent performance for sensor networks. Certain parameters like energy level, link quality, lose rate are considered while making decisions. These decisions will come up with the optimal route and also to take best action against the security attacks. In this paper, the design and initial work on biological-inspired self-organized secure autonomous routing algorithm for sensor networks are presented. The proposed bio-inspired algorithm will also meet the enhanced sensor network requirements, including energy consumption, success rate and time delay.","","978-1-4244-2866-3","978-1-4244-2867-0","10.1109/RFM.2008.4897444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4897444","ANT Colony;Human Immune System;Self-healing;Self-optimization;Wireless Sensor Network","Ant colony optimization;Biosensors;Data security;Humans;Monitoring;Particle swarm optimization;Routing protocols;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","bio-inspired self-organized secure autonomous routing protocol;energy consumption;environmental monitoring;human security;multihop routing;object tracking;security attacks;success rate;time delay;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","","2-4 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It uses Discrete Cosine Transform to build compact generative models which are then used to detect novel classes and concept drift effectively.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to automated response called the Response and Recovery Engine (RRE). Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.","","978-1-4244-4422-9","978-1-4244-4421-2","10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307","","Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics)","Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game","","21","2","28","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504","Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security","Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip","firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests","","0","","28","","2015-06-23","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed.

An organization, not uncompromising on security, dedicates a hefty budget proportion for deploying security plans and updates. Fighting and chasing the modern attackers 24times7 has enforced thoughts of redesigning security framework. Existing perimeter is layered of border routers, firewalls, IDS, IPS, VPN devices, software architecture over DMZs and subnets, beside server and host filters and antivirus applications. These are not fully customizable against adversaries in providing strong security framework. The current deployment nature of security perimeter where these layered components are prone to various egress and ingress nasty activities raises some serious questions. The traditional perimeters do not provide sufficient security to overcome these limitations in order to provide uncompromised security nodes [3][11][12]. To address security needs efficiently, at critical knots within a network, we introduce a security framework. The proposed framework focuses three key areas related to defense-in-depth; (1) maximizing synchronization among layered security services (2) modularizing various services for better endpoint security (3) reducing traffic while providing secure mechanism for encrypted updates in traditional networks.

Unfortunately, the amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Several feature selection and feature extraction techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of data. Few are focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the finding of that finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. A new hybrid algorithm MID-PCA combining PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance - MID evaluation criteria) is proposed. PCA is first applied to the original dataset. Then, mRMR-MID is applied to the intermediary output to further reduce redundancy and maximize relevancy. An exhaustive evaluation of the MID-PCA algorithm is conducted with the KDD Cup'99, a used widely dataset in the network security community. MID-PCA performance was compared to that of PCA and mRMR using two classifiers namely J48 (C4.5) and BayesNet. Experimental results assert the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm MID-PCA for NIDS feature extraction compared with PCA and Mutual Information. The newly proposed MID-PCA shows better performance and classification accuracies with reduced datasets of only 4 dimensions for BayesNet (99.77%) and 6 dimensions for J48 (99.94%). This is an improvement over PCA which achieves similar classification accuracy with 12 principal components (twelve dimensions). An extension of this paper will conduct broader experiments using other datasets, then compare results to that of several well known feature reduction algorithms to confirm the superiority of MID-PCA.","","978-1-4673-2276-8","","10.1109/IS.2012.6335176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335176","Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Mutual Information;Principal Component Analysis","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Principal component analysis","Internet;computer network security;data analysis;feature extraction;pattern classification;principal component analysis;redundancy;telecommunication traffic","BayesNet classifier comparison;Internet traffic monitoring;J48 classifier comparison;KDD Cup'99;MID evaluation criteria;MID-PCA hybrid algorithm;NIDS;classification accuracy;data size reduction;feature extraction technique;feature selection technique;mRMR;malicious activity detection;minimum redundancy maximum relevance;mutual information;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;redundancy reduction;relevancy maximization","","0","","31","","","6-8 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a distributed clustering algorithm based on the group mobility and a revised group mobility metric which is derived from the instantaneous speed and direction of nodes. Our dynamic, distributed clustering approach use Gauss Markov group mobility model for mobility prediction that enables each node to anticipate its mobility relative to its neighbors. In particular, it is suitable for reflecting group mobility pattern where group partitions and mergence are prevalent behaviors of mobile groups. We also take the residual energy of nodes and the number of neighbor nodes into consideration. The proposed clustering scheme aims to form stable clusters by reducing the clustering iterations even in a highly dynamic environment. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed framework is superior to two well-known clustering approaches, the MOBIC and DGMA, in terms of average number of clusterhead changes.","","","","10.1109/APNOMS.2015.7275358","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275358","MANETs;clustering algorithm;group mobility model;node mobility","Clustering algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","Gaussian processes;Markov processes;iterative methods;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern clustering","DGMA;Gauss Markov group mobility model;MANET;MOBIC;distributed clustering algorithm;group mobility based clustering algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;mobility prediction","","","","","","","19-21 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It intends to verify if networking of heterogeneous sensors in WSN improves the system reliability and security. Unlike many other reported approaches, which employ conventional networking intrusion detection techniques in a WSN environment, this paper presents methods specific to sensor networks. They are designed to take an advantage of receiving sensor signals from networked sensors by building the models of the sensor signals and, on the higher network levels, objects under measurement. The methods are based on statistical processing of the measurement results coming from sensors and employing those models to detect the anomalies caused either by an equipment malfunctioning or human malicious activities and mistakes. Three algorithms are examined and implemented with SunSpot sensor kits produced by Sun Corp. Their performance in two intrusion activities executed on real sensor networks is analyzed.","1930-0395","978-1-4244-4548-6","978-1-4244-5335-1","10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5398525","","Acoustic sensors;Base stations;Computer science;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Protection;Sensor systems;Vibration measurement;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Sun Corp;SunSpot sensor;WSN;heterogeneous sensors networking;intrusion detection methods;statistical processing;system reliability;system security;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","25-28 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While it is well-understood that operational conditions may differ from test conditions, little attention has been paid to the question of assessing the effect on IDS results of parameter estimation errors resulting from these differences. In this paper we consider this question in the context of multi-step attacks. We derive simulated distributions of the posterior probability of exploit given the observation of a series of alerts and bounds on the posterior uncertainty given a particular distribution of the model parameters. Knowledge of such bounds introduces the novel prospect of a confidence versus agility tradeoff in IDS administration. Such a tradeoff could give administrators flexibility in IDS configuration, allowing them to choose detection confidence at the price of detection latency, according to organizational priorities.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721564","Bayesian network;Intrusion detection;Probabilistic inference","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer security;Expert systems;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Phase detection;System testing;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;parameter estimation;probability;security of data","inference uncertainty;intrusion detection system;low base rate address;parameter estimation error;posterior probability distribution;test condition;uncertainty-bounding multistep analysis","","0","1","11","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most techniques involve software-based analysis which is too slow to support the tight timing constraints often imposed on embedded systems. We propose a hardware-based intrusion detection approach which does not alter the functional performance of the system. When using a real-time operating system, the executing process changes several times each second, requiring fast adaptation on the part of the intrusion detection mechanism. We present a technique to exploit the partial runtime reconfiguration feature present on many modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to adapt intrusion detection to a new process at each context switch. The use of runtime reconfiguration enables the flexibility of software-based approaches with the performance benefits of hardware-based approaches.","1063-6404","978-1-4673-3051-0","","10.1109/ICCD.2012.6378633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378633","","Doped fiber amplifiers;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Law;Monitoring;Registers;Runtime","embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;invasive software;operating systems (computers)","FPGA;adaptable intrusion detection;anomalous malware behavior;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-based approaches;hardware-based intrusion detection approach;partial runtime reconfiguration;real-time operating system;software-based analysis;software-based approaches;timing constraints","","0","","21","","","Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Lightweight mobile core networks for machine type communications","Taleb, T.; Ksentini, A.; Kobbane, A.","Aalto Univ., Espoo, Finland","Access, IEEE","20141003","2014","2","","1128","1137","Machine type communications (MTCs) enable the communications of machines (devices) to machines over mobile networks. Besides simplifying our daily lives, the MTC business represents a promising market for mobile operators to increase their revenues. However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks. Finally, a real-life implementation of LightEPC on top of cloud platform is discussed.","2169-3536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2359649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906244","Carrier cloud;Machine type communications (MTC);mobile cloud networking;network function virtualization (NFV)","Logic gates;Machine-to-machine communications;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Object recognition;Protocols;Radio access networks;Servers","3G mobile communication;cloud computing;mobile computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","3GPP;LightEPC framework;MTC;NFV;cloud computing;cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks;machine type communications;network function virtualization;network node failures","","3","","27","","2014-09-22","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
