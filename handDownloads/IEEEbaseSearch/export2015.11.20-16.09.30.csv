The network conditions like topology, node density, energy constraint makes difficult to decide which protocol suits best for the scenario. The routing in MANETs exploits Proactive and Reactive Routing. Proactive routing provides better packet delivery while Reactive routing has low overheads. Thus, Hybrid routing approach is needed to carry out the routing using both proactive and reactive approaches. The paper proposes a Hybrid Routing algorithm which utilizes the benefits of both reactive and proactive routing in MANETs. The protocol mainly focuses on trust factor of the node which uses frequency of the node and number of retransmissions from the node. The protocol changes its behavior according to different applications in MANETs.","","978-1-4799-8889-1","","10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7148405","Frequency;MANETs;Trust factor","Ad hoc networks;Cache memory;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing","MANET node trust factor;hybrid routing algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;proactive routing protocol;reactive routing protocol;routing attacks","","0","","15","","","15-16 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anonymization of network data for sharing sets up a fundamental tradeoff between privacy protection versus security analysis capability. This privacy/analysis tradeoff has been acknowledged by many researchers but this is the first paper to provide empirical measurements to characterize the privacy/analysis tradeoff for an enterprise dataset. Specifically we perform anonymization options on single-fields within network packet traces and then make measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy for security analysis capability. Our results show: (1) two fields have a zero sum tradeoff (more privacy lessens security analysis and vice versa) and (2) eight fields have a more complex tradeoff (that is not zero sum) in which both privacy and analysis can both be simultaneously accomplished.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529343","privacy-enhanced security data sharing","Access control;Automation;Collaboration;Data privacy;Data security;Information analysis;Information security;Pattern analysis;Protection;Risk analysis","data privacy;security of data","anonymized packet traces;distributed security analysis;intrusion detection system alarms;network data;privacy protection;security analysis capability","","0","","32","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper concerns using Computational intelligence based learning machines for intrusion detection in hierarchical order of attacking scenarios, which is a problem of general interest to transportation infrastructure protection since a necessary task thereof is to protect the computers responsible for the infrastructure's operational control, and an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy. Hence we use SVM for our proposed Hierarchical Feature reduction for intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396095","DOS;IDS;PSO;Probe;R2l;U2R;support vector machine","Accuracy;Hafnium compounds;Optimization;Subspace constraints","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines","ANN;Artificial Neural Networks;HAB-IDS;HFO-ANID;IDS;SVM;Support Vector Machines;anomaly based intrusion detection systems;attack scenario;computational intelligence based learning machines;hierarchical feature optimization;network security;problem solving;transportation infrastructure protection","","0","","27","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for the CLEFIA to date.

Through fault-injection simulations, the proposed schemes are benchmarked, and it is shown that they achieve error coverage of close to 100%.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision. We conclude our paper with properties and recommendations for IDSs working for WSNs and some future works.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296068","Energy consumption;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Byzantine generals problem;IDS;WSN lifetime;attack detection;encryption;environmental data monitoring;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network lifetime;oral message algorithm;prevention measures;security challenges;spatial distributed autonomous sensors;wireless sensor network","","0","","42","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper concerns detecting DoS attacks using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The key idea is to train SVMs using already discovered patterns (signatures) that represent DoS attacks. Using a benchmark data from a KDD competition designed by DARPA (U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), we demonstrate that highly efficient and accurate classifiers can be constructed by using SVMs to detect DoS attacks.

However, the amount of available IPv4 addresses only has about 250 million. Although some solutions for saving the IPv4 shortage problem, like NAT or CIDR, were applied, the best way for solving the IPv4 shortage is using IPv6 addresses. Because the protocol between the IPv4 and IPv6 address is not compatible, the dual stack solution may be needed to support IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Hence, the organization facing the threats from both IPv4 and IPv6 networks will be a critical issue. In this paper, we proposed a light-weight penetration test tool for IPv6 threats to detect vulnerability in the network environment. In the proposed system, we first use common IPv6 attack tool to generate IPv6 attack signatures to attack a virtual victim. A sniffer will be used to observe network package to check whether it meets pre-defined signatures.

For intrusion detection method based support vector machine (SVM), there is a big obstacle that the amount of audit data for modeling is very large even for a small network scale, so it's impractical to directly train SVM using original training datasets. Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance. So it is worth applying and popularizing.","","978-1-4244-3835-8","978-0-7695-3816-7","10.1109/AICI.2009.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5375980","extension clustering;intrusion detection;support vector machine","Artificial intelligence;Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Delay;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","security of data;support vector machines","extension clustering support vector machine;intrusion detection algorithm;response time","","0","","13","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them, ""ICMP traceback (iTrace)"" is currently being considered as an industry standard by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). While the idea of iTrace is very clever, efficient, reasonably secure and practical, it suffers a serious statistic problem such that the chance for ""useful"" and ""valuable"" iTrace messages can be extremely small against various types of DDoS attacks. This implies that most of the network resources spent on generating and utilizing iTrace messages will be wasted. Therefore, we propose a simple enhancement called ""intention-driven"" iTrace, which conceptually introduces an extra bit in the routing and forwarding process.

ANCS 2005. Symposium on","20081117","2005","","","211","220","Real-time IP flow estimation has many potential applications in network management, monitoring, security, and traffic engineering. Existing techniques typically rely on flow definitions being constrained as subsets of the fields in packet headers. This makes flow-membership tests relatively inexpensive. In this paper, we consider a more general flow estimation problem that needs complex packet-payload based tests for flow-membership. An example is to estimate traffic with common strings in the payload and detect potential virus signatures for early alarm generation.

Thus, with a system that seeks only to define and categorize normalcy, there is the potential to detect new types of network attacks without any prior knowledge of their existence.

In this paper, we firstly define the entropy-based analysis, then analyze the amount of incoming packets to our collage. As the results, we were able to extract the following features for the entropy analysis. Firstly, entropy-based analysis detect distributed small amount of 80/TCP anomaly accesses compared to the frequency-based analysis.

Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538","Keywords—Local monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.","Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication","","6","","39","","2010-12-30","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As an additional security measure, the intrusion detection system would help determine whether unauthorized users are attempting to access, have already accessed, or have compromised the network Intrusion detection, as the second line of defense, is an indispensable tool for highly survivable networks. In this paper two anomaly intrusion detection methods are proposed for peer-to-peer system. The main characters of the methods are that they can detect intrusion in real-time without any expert knowledge and attack signatures. One method uses hidden Markov model to check reflector DoS attacks, another based on adaptive resonance theory, which can learn the normal behavior with unsupervised method. The experimental P2P system is built on FreePastry 1.401 and JDK 1.5.0. The results have indicated that the methods can find DoS attacks immediately and find new intruders with low false alarm rate.","","978-0-7695-2943-1","","10.1109/NPC.2007.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4351471","","Application software;Authentication;Communication system security;Computer crime;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Resonance","adaptive resonance theory;hidden Markov models;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","adaptive resonance theory;anomaly intrusion detection methods;hidden Markov model;peer-to-peer system","","0","","19","","","18-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detecting anomalies is hence critical both to protect against misuse and attacks, but is subject to constraints. These include primarily efficiency, but also legal and contractual restrictions limiting the depth of intrusiveness, which can be achieved by an intrusion detection system. In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients. In this paper we therefore propose to monitor system calls at the VM host level without requiring any instrumentation within VMs and argue that this level of granularity is sufficient to capture a number of relevant attack classes. This, together with the efficiency and efficacy of the approach is shown through experiments and statistical analysis in a Linux KVM-based reference scenario.

Many diverse, mission-critical applications are deployed, including military, rescue, healthcare, factory floor, and smart homes. Security is a fundamental requirement in such sensitive applications in order to ensure their reliable and stable operation. However, security is a fairly difficult task to achieve. The open nature of the wireless communication, the unrestricted deployment and limitations of WSNs and the existence of a variety of attacks threaten the security of a sensor network. Currently, research efforts have mainly focused on developing prevention and intrusion detection mechanisms in WSNs. Intrusion recovery is also an important aspect of security provisioning that is not given the same attention. Researchers have proposed intrusion recovery protocols to restore the network's operation when an attack is detected. Their designs are mostly based on simplified threat models, making the intrusion recovery countermeasures vulnerable to advanced threat models. Although the network may recover its operation after an attack is detected, it does not mean that the threat is eliminated. For example, a persistent adversary can adapt his intrusion strategy to compromise the deployed recovery countermeasure. This research work evaluates the robustness and reliability of well-known recovery countermeasures in WSNs against persistent adversaries. Evaluation results have shown that existing intrusion recovery solutions are vulnerable and can be exploited under different attack strategies in order to compromise the applied recovery countermeasures, and thus the network. The vulnerability assessment is carried out using ns-2 simulations in an IEEE 802.15.4 network and within the AODV context. Observations derived from the assessment contribute towards future directions that can drive new designs of intrusion recov- - ery protocols in WSNs.","1530-1346","978-1-4577-0680-6","978-1-4577-0678-3","10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983922","WSN security;advanced threat model;intrusion recovery;vulnerability assessment","Computer crime;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Switches;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;protocols;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","AODV context;IEEE 802.15.4 network;WSN;factory floor;healthcare;intrusion recovery countermeasure;ns-2 simulations;pervasive computing;protocols;smart homes;vulnerability assessment;wireless communication;wireless sensor networks","","1","","28","","","June 28 2011-July 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The case study presented starts with a multi-attribute risk assessment that results in a prioritized list of risks. Security specialists estimate countermeasure benefits and how the organization's risks are reduced. Using SAEM, security design alternatives are compared with the organization's current selection of security technologies to see if a more cost-effective solution is possible.

Research has shown that the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can enable distributed application and devices to device communication, even on very resource constrained devices, and thus play an important role for IoT and CPS. In order to realize the vision of Internet of Things, communication between devices must be secured. Security mechanisms for resource constrained devices has attracted much interest from the academic community, where research groups have shown solutions like IPsec, VPN-tunnels, (D)TLS, etc. are feasible to use on this type of networks. However, even though the use of well-known security mechanisms are vital for SOA-based IoT/CPS networks and systems to be protected, they do not provide any fine-grain access control. In this paper, a CoAP-based framework for service-level access control on low-power devices is presented. The framework allows fine grain access control on a per service and method basis. For example, by using this approach a device can allow read/write access to its services to one group of users while only allowing read access to another group. Users without the right credentials are not even allowed to discover available services. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, several implementations are presented together with test results. The aim is to provide a holistic framework for secure SOA-based low power networks comprise by resource constrain devices.","","","","10.1109/IECON.2014.7049308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7049308","","Access control;Authentication;IP networks;Protocols;Servers;Service-oriented architecture","Internet of Things;authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;service-oriented architecture;telecommunication power management","CoAP based Internet of Things;access control framework;authentication framework;available service discovery;constrained application protocol;cyber-physical systems;device communication;fine grain access control;low power device;resource constrain device;right credentials;security mechanisms;service level access control;service oriented architecture","","0","","20","","","Oct. 29 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Architectural problems including the difficulty to overcome distributed and coordinated attacks, because it requires large amounts of distributed information, thus requiring synchronization between detection components of scattered information anyway. This paper proposes the multiagent architecture that implements distributed IDS based on ACC to recognize a new and coordinated attack, and the movement of large data handling, synchronization capabilities, the ability of cooperation between components without the presence of centralized computing components, good detection performance in real-time to turn on warning alarm.","","978-1-4799-8477-0","","10.1109/ICEECS.2014.7045229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045229","ACC;IDS;agent;ant colony clustering;distributed;intrusion detection system","Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Distributed databases;Feature extraction;Load modeling;Real-time systems","ant colony optimisation;computer crime;distributed processing;multi-agent systems;pattern clustering;software architecture","ACC;ant colony clustering;attack detection;cooperative agent;coordinated attacks;data handling;distributed IDS;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion detection system;information security;multiagent architecture;synchronization capabilities","","0","","16","","","24-25 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing,","20081021","2008","","","608","612","One popular solution for reducing the resource consumption of intrusion detection system (IDS) in MANET is to elect a head-cluster (leader) to provide intrusion detection service to other nodes in the same cluster. However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively reduce the IDS resource consumption without sacrificing security.","","978-0-7695-3393-3","978-0-7695-3393-3","10.1109/WiMob.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654307","Game theory;Intrusion detection systems;MANET security;leader election","Communication system security;Game theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Protection;Robustness;Sampling methods;Switches","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;probability;telecommunication security","Bayesian game theory;MANET;intrusion detection;leader election;nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model;probability;resource consumption","","2","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers. Thus, we conclude that estimating the information entropy and the relevant inference risk using a pre-processor can yield a simpler and more accurate classification tree.","1082-3409","978-1-4244-5619-2","978-0-7695-3920-1","10.1109/ICTAI.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362617","","Artificial intelligence;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Facebook;Information entropy;Information security;Privacy;Protection;Risk analysis;Social network services","decision trees;entropy;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;mobile computing;pattern classification;risk analysis","Web2.0 applications;classification tree analysis;data training;decision tree;information entropy;knowledge representation;large mobile phone field;location-aware application;low-entropy situations;preprocessor;social inference risk estimation method;unwanted social inference function;user privacy","","2","","29","","","2-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper tries to exploit some interesting concepts proposed by the new danger theory to overcome the problems associated with the self and non-self model. That by improving NSA in order to achieve better detection rates by integrating the basic danger concepts. In this approach, the intrusion detection is related to the damage that can occur in the system and that can be caused by both external elements such as internal elements.

Our work is complementary and consists in reorganising a given set of existing countermeasures in order to optimise both the security and the availability of the circuit without reducing its global performances. The proposed solution is based on a double-processor architecture and on mechanisms to parametrise the hardware and software countermeasures. One processor embeds the state-of-the-art set of countermeasures and executes the application code. The second processor, much smaller, applies the strategy of security (i.e the response of the circuit when a security event arises), but without sharing sensitive data with the first processor.

The increase in transmission of highly sensitive data and challenges of data protection and of privacy, data loss prevention has major significant implications for systems engineering, systems integration, and systems analysis, design and validation. Furthermore, the design and development of complex integrated systems engineering and network systems lack effective transparency, auditability, validation and implementation of adequate security measures for transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks using third party and outsourced networks and the Internet and global privacy regulatory requirements for such data transfer across international borders. The major problem with current state of art approaches of controls for global critical infrastructures of virtual private networks (VPN) depend on inadequate third-party systems. Thus current approaches lack transparency, auditability and validation of the implementation of adequate privacy and security controls for data transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks.

However, such a centralized approach is not flexible nor is it robust. For example, it is very hard to find an appropriate system to which the user can upload information during a disaster, and the centralized server may be down because of overload or has been physically destroyed. We must consider a distributed and dynamic architecture for the system.

Tested systems included the BlueView ProViewer P450E-15, BlueView ProViewer P900E-20, and RESON SeaBat 7128, which were chosen for the good balance of resolution and range provided by their frequency of operation (450 kHz, 900 kHz, and 400 kHz, respectively) revealed during a prior study. Video clips were recorded from these systems while observing swimmers, open-circuit scuba divers, and closed-circuit rebreather divers in a marine harbor in St. Petersburg, FL. Clips were randomized and presented to 18 volunteer evaluators who were asked to identify which clips contained divers and which did not. The highest scoring system also had the highest operating frequency. However, the same high-scoring sonar in a different configuration scored similar to the system with the lowest frequency. This indicates that signal frequency, and therefore image resolution, is not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. After noticing many evaluators performed poorly with cluttered clips or clips with low acoustic target strength, results were recalculated to remove swimmers and surface swim routes such that only uncluttered, clearly-reflecting targets were included. Some sonar scores were moderately improved by this change, while others significantly decreased. This indicated that target clarity is also not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. Further analysis is recommended to reveal all major factors affecting assessment to maximize quality and eventually bring underwater security assessment to a high level.","","978-1-4244-4332-1","","10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664320","","Acoustic beams;Acoustics;Book reviews;Humans;Imaging;Security;Sonar","sonar imaging;underwater acoustic communication","high security underwater assessment;human recognizable images;imaging sonars;preliminary evaluation;surface swim routes","","0","","1","","","20-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually such attacker degrades the network performance in terms of packet loss rate, collision, and overhead. Designing MANET that can work reliably even in the presence of inside packet drop attackers is really challenging. In order to overcome these issues, we have proposed an enhanced Ant based Defense Mechanism for Selective Forwarding Attack in MANET. First, we have implemented S-ACK scheme to transmit the secure acknowledgement. To detect attackers, a trust model is designed. The Forward ant agents transmit back the digitally signed S-ACK through the Backward Ant agent to detect any selective forwarding attack against any source node. Also a Challenge and Monitoring packet is transmitted by source node to monitor the neighbor node and the verification table updated by an ant agent.","","","","10.1109/ICDEW.2015.7129553","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129553","Forwarding Attack;MANET;digitally signed","Monitoring;Packet loss;Reliability","ant colony optimisation;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","ACO technique;MANET;S-ACK scheme;ant based defense mechanism;backward ant agent;forward ant agents;mobile ad hoc network;secure acknowledgement;selective forwarding attack;trust model","","0","","12","","","13-17 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we model the activity of an intruder with a Markov chain of finite state space, corresponding to logical or physical states in a network, and suppose there is a state b which we would not like the intruder to enter. The intruder, on the other hand, would like to enter this sensitive part of the network and wants to spend as much time there as possible. The state of the intruder evolves in discrete time; also there are a limited number of opportunities for the security system to make state observations over the finite horizon of the problem. This model can be used to capture the essence of intrusion detection in a variety of situations such as hackers in a network or physical intruders in a spatial area where there is a constraint on the number of observations one may make due to power limitations. We develop an optimal policy for dynamically scheduling observations to minimize the amount of time that the intruder spends in b without being discovered.","","978-1-4673-0008-7","978-1-4673-0723-9","10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6167419","IT security;decision making;dynamic programming;intrusion detection;monitoring;network security;resource allocation;surveillance","Communities;Dynamic programming;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Vectors","Markov processes;computer network security","IT networks;Markov chain;alarm intrusion detection;computer network;finite state space;network logical states;network physical states;optimal policy","","0","","14","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The recently discovered security attacks like W32.Stuxnet and the Duqu worm changed this almost established belief. Further, usual methods of anomaly detection cannot simply be employed in embedded systems since they are usually resource-constrained and the detection methods might interfere with performance of the main system tasks. However, behavior of applications running in embedded systems is relatively known, and profiling the correct behavior and comparing it with the runtime behavior is accounted as an effective approach for anomaly detection with no such interferences. In this paper, we consider the inter-effects of processor temperature and power consumption of embedded systems, and present a novel technique to detect malicious activities with minor delays with respect to the occurrences. This is done through analyzing the simultaneously observed power and temperature of the processor. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by using the power and temperature traces of a real processor obtained through detailed simulations.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994033","X2-distance;anomaly detection;clustering;power trace;profiling;temperature trace","Embedded systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","computer crime;embedded systems;invasive software;power consumption;safety-critical software","Duqu worm;W32.Stuxnet;anomaly detection;embedded systems;malicious activities detection;power consumption;power monitoring;processor power;processor temperature inter-effects;runtime behavior;security attacks;security violations;temperature monitoring","","0","","20","","","3-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary users dictate the system states and their transitions while the secondary users and jammers behave non-cooperatively to achieve their goals independently under different system environment. Our Markovian game model captures not only the zero-sum interactions between secondary users and the jammers but also the dynamics of the system. Our results indicate that the secondary users can enhance their security level or increase their long-term payoff by either improving their sensing capabilities to confuse the jammer with the choice or choosing to communicate under states where the available channels are less prone to jamming.

A Web service is defined as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network based on a set of XML standards. This new architecture and set of protocols brings new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect Web services. In this paper, we propose using honeypots to detect and study attacks against Web services. Honeypots are used to learn new techniques, tools and motivations of hackers to better protect the production systems against attacks. Our solution (WS Honeypot) is to deploy a honeypot as a web service application. This honeypot captures all request messages and analyses them by using machine learning techniques in order to detect and study attacks.","","978-1-4577-1439-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064371","","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Humans;Intrusion detection;Simple object access protocol;Support vector machines","Web services;XML;computer crime;open systems;software architecture","Web service honeypot;XML standard;encryption mechanism;firewalls;hacker motivation;interoperable machine-to-machine interaction;intrusion detection system;machine learning;next-generation Web application;request message;security technique;software system design","","0","","14","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, current distributed intrusion detection system mostly uses distributed component to collect data then sent to processing center. Data is analyzed in the processing center. These models have the following problems: bad real time capability, bottleneck, and single point of failure. In order to overcome these shortcomings of current intrusion detection techniques, a new distributed intrusion detection model based on mobile agent is proposed in this paper. Intelligent and mobile characteristics of the agent are used to make computing move to data. As mobile agent can only improve the structure of system and can not supply fundamental new detecting techniques, improved dynamic clonal selection algorithm and collaborative signal mechanism are adopted for reducing false positive rate and increasing detection rate in this paper. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm were simulated by KDDpsila99 datasets. Comparing with winning entry of KDDpsila99 classifier learning contest, the proposed model has low false positive rate and higher detection rate in both Dos and Probing attacks, and greatly higher detection rate in U2R attack. Robustness and dynamic adaptability of the system are validated.","","978-0-7695-3699-6","","10.1109/APCIP.2009.249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5197236","dynamic clonal selection;intrusion detection system;mobile agent","Autonomous agents;Collaboration;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Detectors;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents","mobile agents;security of data","collaborative signal mechanism;distributed component;distributed intrusion detection model;dynamic clonal selection algorithm;immune mobile agent;intelligent agent;intrusion detection system;processing center","","0","","8","","","18-19 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we make the first attempt to establish several models for the security of network protocols. We divide the security of network protocols into two folders: the implementation security of network protocols, and the design security of network protocols. Four models are proposed to clarify the security problems: software vulnerability model, scalability model, authentication model, and covert model. We also propose several defense principles for all models. The security reduction is also proposed to transform the solution method for security problems to other available security verification and testing approaches. For example, the implementation security of network protocols is reduced to the security of software implementation for parsing protocols, so that the fuzzy test can be used for verification. The pressure test are used for scalability model. The exploration of the paper can help to stimulate the further discussions on the foundations of network security, especially the design security of network protocols.","","978-1-4673-2100-6","","10.1109/ICCT.2012.6511311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511311","Network Security;Security Model;Security Requirement Engineering;Software Security","","fuzzy set theory;message authentication;protocols;telecommunication security","authentication model;covert model;defense principle;design security;fuzzy test;network protocol design;network security;parsing protocol;scalability model;security reduction;security verification;software vulnerability model;testing approach","","0","","11","","","9-11 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Network anomaly detection tools based on association rules","Othman, Z.A.; Eljadi, E.E.","Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.","2155-6822","978-1-4577-0753-7","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705","Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS)","Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces","computer network security;data mining","CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule","","1","","25","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current implementations allow passengers to access Internet for pleasure and in some cases secure VPN access is provided to corporate networks. Several researchers are looking at the possibility of the existence of a total of three networks: passenger network (PN); crew network (CRN); and the control network (CON). Researchers envision an architecture where these three networks will co-exist in an airplane. The available Internet connectivity can be utilized for transporting flight critical information like cockpit flight data recorder (CFDR) data, digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data, cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data, and controller pilot data link communication. In addition, the Internet connectivity could also be used for other safety mechanisms like video surveillance and remote control of the flight. Security is one of the major concerns that affect the successful deployment of aircraft data networks (ADN) and other safety features. Several studies have been carried out to secure the network using firewalls and intrusion detection system but so far no study has focused on securing the communication channel (between the aircraft and the ground station) and its impact on the ADN. The scope of this research is to determine the viability and need of a security mechanism. The research also focuses on the performance of different security architectures and determine their usability in the framework of an ADN.","0885-8985","","","10.1109/MAES.2006.1635168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635168","","Aerospace safety;Aircraft;Airplanes;Communication system control;Communication system security;Data security;IP networks;Internet;Video surveillance;Virtual private networks","Internet;aerospace computing;aircraft communication;aircraft displays;virtual private networks","Internet connectivity;VPN access;aircraft data networks;cockpit flight data recorder data;cockpit voice recorder data;communication channel;control network;controller pilot data link communication;corporate networks;crew network;digital flight data recorder data;flight critical information;intrusion detection system;passenger network;remote control;video surveillance","","1","","17","","","May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The GNP is based on directed graph, In this paper the security issues related to deploy a data mining-based IDS in a real time environment is focused upon. We generalize the problem of GNP with association rule mining and propose a fuzzy weighted association rule mining with GNP framework suitable for both continuous and discrete attributes. Our proposal follows an Apriori algorithm based fuzzy WAR and GNP and avoids pre and post processing thus eliminating the extra steps during rules generation. This method can sufficient to evaluate misuse and anomaly detection.

Such a system can work without the need for massive sets of pre-labeled training data and has the added versatility of being free of the over specialization that comes with systems tailored for specific sets of attacks. Thus, with a system that seeks only to define and categorize normalcy, there is the potential to detect new types of network attacks without any prior knowledge of their existence.

Introducing objects into the control processes of complex systems makes IoT security very difficult to address. Indeed, the Internet of Things is a complex paradigm in which people interact with the technological ecosystem based on smart objects through complex processes. The interactions of these four IoT components, person, intelligent object, technological ecosystem, and process, highlight a systemic and cognitive dimension within security of the IoT. The interaction of people with the technological ecosystem requires the protection of their privacy. Similarly, their interaction with control processes requires the guarantee of their safety. Processes must ensure their reliability and realize the objectives for which they are designed. We believe that the move towards a greater autonomy for objects will bring the security of technologies and processes and the privacy of individuals into sharper focus. Furthermore, in parallel with the increasing autonomy of objects to perceive and act on the environment, IoT security should move towards a greater autonomy in perceiving threats and reacting to attacks, based on a cognitive and systemic approach. In this work, we will analyze the role of each of the mentioned actors in IoT security and their relationships, in order to highlight the research challenges and present our approach to these issues based on a holistic vision of IoT security.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785328","","Context;Data privacy;Ecosystems;Privacy;Reliability;Safety;Security","Internet of Things;data privacy;security of data","IoT security;cognitive dimension;control processes;internet of things;object autonomy;privacy protection;safety guarantee;smart objects;systemic dimension;technological ecosystem","","0","","14","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
