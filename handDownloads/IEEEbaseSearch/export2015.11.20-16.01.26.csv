This paper focuses on the design of a new anomaly detection system for each node of the network, which contains detection subsystem for MAC layer, routing layer and application layer. Audit data taken from MAC level/network level/application level from the traces in Glomosim and are preprocessed separately for each layer's detection subsystem. Feature data sets for each layer are selected from normal transactions. The detection subsystem contains normal profiles obtained from the feature vectors of training data sets. In our work, we used Bayesian classification algorithm, Markov chain construction algorithm and association rule mining algorithm for anomaly detection in MAC layer, routing layer and application layer respectively for effective intrusion detection. Test data obtained from the network traffic is feed in to the detection subsystems. If there is any deviation from normal behavior, it is considered as abnormal or anomaly based on predefined thresholds. Intrusion results from detection subsystems of all the three layers are integrated at local integration module and the final result is sent to the global integration module. Intrusion results are received also from the neighbor nodes and are sent to the global integration module for making a final decision","","1-4244-0997-7","1-4244-0997-7","10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156645","","Association rules;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Media Access Protocol;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Training data","Bayes methods;Markov processes;ad hoc networks;data mining;decision making;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Bayesian classification algorithm;MAC layer;Markov chain construction algorithm;application layer;association rule mining algorithm;decision making;mobile adhoc network;multilayer integrated anomaly intrusion detection;network traffic;routing layer","","5","","15","","","22-24 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detecting attacks based on information taken from a single protocol or a group of protocols at a certain layer results in a high rate of false positives or false negatives. In this paper, we introduce a new cross protocol design for IDSs in the NGNs based on protocol anomaly detection. Our design aims at correlating various detection results from the protocols involved in a session, both, horizontally and vertically. By horizontal correlation we aim at monitoring sessions taking place within a single layer of the protocol stack, whereas, vertical correlation addresses sessions taking place across multiple protocol layers. In addition, our design is supported by intelligent mechanism based on fuzzy logic to help the system reduce the rate of false alarms which is relatively high in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems.

The task of traffic identification is a complex task due to the constantly changing Internet and an increase in encrypted data. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as port-based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications use random ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes an Optimized Hybrid Model (OHM) that makes use of a rule-based model (Apriori) along with a self-organizing map (SOM) model to tackle the problem of traffic classification without making use of the payload or ports. The proposed method also allows the generation of association rules for new unknown applications and further labeling by experts. Besides that, a optimizer called Firefly Algorithm was also used to enhance the results by optimizing both Apriori and SOM parameters and a comparative study was performed on both optimized and non-optimized models. The OHM showed to be superior to a non-optimized model for both eMule and Skype applications, reaching levels superior to 94% for correctness rate. The OHM was also validated against another model based on computational intelligence, named Realtime, and the OHM proposed in this work presented better results when tested in real time.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755057","Association Rules;Firefly Algorithm;Network Traffic Measurement;Self-Organizing Maps","Association rules;Computational modeling;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems;Training","Internet;computer network management;cryptography;data mining;evolutionary computation;pattern classification;self-organising feature maps","Apriori;DPI;Internet;OHM;Realtime computational intelligence;SOM;Skype;association rules;deep packet inspection;eMule;encrypted data;firefly algorithm;hybrid model;network traffic classification;network traffic identification;optimized hybrid model;port-based inspection;rule-based model;self-organizing map;traffic volume","","1","","24","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classic way to identify flows, e.g., examining the port numbers in the packet headers, becomes ineffective. In this context, deep packet inspection technology, which does not only inspect the packet headers but also the packet payloads, plays a more important role in traffic classification. Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA. We also introduce some optimizations to accelerate the matching speed.

Thus, it is of paramount importance to protect the networks from attackers. Consequently, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are quickly becoming a popular requirement in building a network security infrastructure. Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT.

However, they tend to show good performance on off-line data and their accuracy drop when they are deployed to realtime intrusion detection systems that receive data streams constantly. In other words, the problem with a conventional classifier model, when applied to realtime detection systems, is that it is likely to perform poorly against new data that is different from the patterns against which the model was trained. This work presents an adaptive classification framework for a realtime intrusion detection system that changes its behavior according to the patterns occurred in the new received data. The performance of the system is constantly monitored and whenever it drops under a certain level of accuracy, the classifier model is retrained to learn new patterns and eliminate the obsolete ones from its knowledge. Further, the framework uses a semi rule-based approach to classification in order to make the model more understandable for human experts and facilitate the user interference in the learning process.","","978-1-4673-1420-6","","10.1109/CYBER.2012.6392538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392538","","Accuracy;Association rules;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;user interfaces","adaptive classification framework;classification algorithm;classifier model;cyberinfrastructure;cybersecurity;data mining method;incremental semi rule-based learning model;realtime intrusion detection system;user interference","","0","","13","","","27-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, it is very difficult to find a real origin of attackers because DoS/DDoS attacker uses spoofed IP addresses. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic route selection algorithm to trace the attacker's real origin. This algorithm uses three types of packets such as an alert packet, an agent packet and a reply agent packet. The alert packet is in use to notify to a victim that DDoS attacks occur. The agent packet is in use to find the attacker's real origin and the reply agent packet is in use to notify to a victim that the agent packet is reached the edge router of the attacker. When source-end detector and victim-end detector detect attacks, the victim-end detector sends the alert packet to the victim. The victim received the alert packet generates the agent packet and sends it to a victim's edge router. The attacker's edge router received the agent packet generates the reply agent packet and send it to the victim. The agent packet and the reply agent packet is forwarded refer to probabilistic packet forwarding table by routers. The probabilistic route selection algorithm runs on the distributed routers and probabilistic packet forwarding table is stored and managed by routers. We simulate for the propose of validation this algorithm by using OPNET14.0 in terms of false positive and required number of packets to trace DDoS attack traffic source.","","978-1-4244-9222-0","978-1-4244-9223-7","10.1109/ICISA.2011.5772420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5772420","","Computer crime;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Logic gates;Probabilistic logic;Watermarking","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;probability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack traffic source;DoS attack;Internet;OPNET14.0;agent packet;alert packet;distributed denial of service;probabilistic packet forwarding;probabilistic route selection algorithm;reply agent packet;source-end detector;spoofed IP addresses;victim-end detector","","0","","7","","","26-29 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The end-to-end (E2E) sharing of information related to probes and attacks is a facet of an emerging trend toward ""collaborative security"". The key benefit of a collaborative approach to intrusion detection is a better view of global network attack activity. Augmenting the information obtained at a single site with information gathered from across the network can provide a more precise model of an attacker's behavior and intent. While many organizations see value in adopting such a collaborative approach, some challenges must be addressed before intrusion detection can be performed on an inter-organizational scale. We report on our experience developing and deploying a decentralized system for efficiently distributing alerts to collaborating peers. Our system, worminator, extracts relevant information from alert streams and encodes it in bloom filters. This information forms the basis of a distributed watchlist.

After biological immune principles are introduced, the corresponding distributed intrusion detection model is described in detail. With the detector set generated by evolutionary negative selection algorithm, the immune agents can evolve to adapt to the change of intrusion patterns according to the real circumstance. Therefore the anomaly changes in large non-self space can be detected by the immune agents with relatively small detector sets.

Database firewalls take defense deep into the organization by providing full syntax control and audit of the SQL API stream before it reaches the database, and enforcing content-driven access to database. This paper proposes a layered reference model for database firewalls by enhancing the capability of COAST Laboratorys model. It separates a database firewall into three layers (network layer, schematic layer and semantic layer) according to the knowledge, computation target, and the control granularity of each layer.

This paper deals with design consideration of Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on the Hadoop framework and acceleration of its performance by using General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU). The large volume of data from an entire infrastructure is assigned to Hadoop framework and intrusion detections are carried out on GPGPU. This approach improves NIDS performance and it enables to provide quick response to various attacks on the network. In order to perform the general purposed computation on the GPU, NVidia provides the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which is a parallel programming model which performs high-end complex operations using GPU. In order to process large volumes of data in distributed networks, Hadoop framework has to configure with various supporting ecosystems like Flume, Pig, Hive and HBase. These ecosystems enable the Hadoop framework to handle streaming data on the network and large log files on servers. The proposed system is capable of performing analytics over intrusion pattern and their behavior on the network, which helps a network administrator to configure network security policy and settings. Analytics over intrusion is done by using a Score-Weight approach called as Pattern Frequency Inverse Cluster Frequency (PF-ICF). The design consideration of accelerated NIDS is a solution towards the performance issues of various NIDS that faces due to the large volumes of the network traffic.","","","","10.1109/PERVASIVE.2015.7087201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087201","CUDA;GPGPU;Hadoop;NIDS;Network Security","Algorithm design and analysis;Ecosystems;Graphics processing units;Intrusion detection;Servers;Telecommunication traffic","data analysis;graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming;security of data","CUDA;Compute Unified Device Architecture;Flume;GPGPU;HBase;Hadoop framework;Hive;NIDS;NVidia;PF-ICF;Pig;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion pattern analytics;log files;network intrusion detection system;network security policy;network traffic;parallel programming model;pattern frequency inverse cluster frequency;score-weight approach;streaming data handling","","0","","15","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is, however, currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by administrative and legal complaints. To gain an insight into such abuse, we designed and implemented a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and the systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints, and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard. Our results show that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malwares have been identified. To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections. To facilitate forensic traceback of malicious traffic, we implemented a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling-based approach to correlate botnet traffic at Tor entry routers and that at exit routers.

Generally, these mechanisms overwhelmingly describe and record patterns of suspicious packets as alerts in the form of intrusion logs. Thereafter, analysts must subsequently validate the content of each intrusion log to ascertain the validity of each alert. Secondly, high level of expertise is required to discern each alert. However, more time and resources are unduly spent at the expense of countermeasures that ought to be proactively initiated to thwart attacks in progress. Accordingly, TSA-Log analyzer that uses a computationally fast technique and a uniform baseline to determine patterns of intrusions is proposed in this paper. Validations that are carried out on five publicly available datasets demonstrate that propagation strategies of intrusions, efficient countermeasures and the extent of similarity of intrusions can be forecasted giving the knowledge of the patterns of alerts in intrusion logs.","","978-1-4673-0687-4","","10.1109/CIS.2011.6169144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6169144","Alert;intrusion;intrusion detection system;patterns of intrusions;time series analysis;timestamp","Computer networks;Computers;Conferences;Cybernetics;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Time series analysis","forecasting theory;security of data;time series","TSA-log analyzer;computer system threats;electronic evidence monitoring;intrusion detection system;intrusion logs;network intrusion forecasting;thwart attacks;time series analysis","","0","","19","","","1-2 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET. The purpose of this paper is to present an improved version of EAACK called EAACK2 that performs better in the presence of false misbehavior and partial dropping.","1550-445X","978-1-61284-313-1","978-0-7695-4337-6","10.1109/AINA.2011.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763422","DSA;Digital Signature;EAACK;MANET","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Encryption;Mobile computing;Public key;Receivers","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","DSA;EAACK scheme;MANET;digital signature algorithm;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;forged acknowledgement detection;mobile ad hoc network;wireless communication mechanisms","","5","1","24","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a stat- based approach to measuring intrusion impacts on the basis of IDS reports, and analyzing costs and benefits of response polices supposed to be taken. Specifically, assuming the system evolves as a Markov process conditioned upon the current system state, imperfect observation and action, a partially observable Markov decision process to model the efficacy of IDSs (as well as alert correlation technology) as providing a probabilistic assessment of the state of system assets, and to maximize rewards (cost and benefit) by taking appropriate actions in response to the estimated states.

Due to lack of information, it can be quite difficult for conventional intrusion detection systems to identify such attacks in progress. Cooperative intrusion detection, on the basis of information sharing, is proved as a necessary measure to detect widespread attacks by other researcher D. Frincke (2000), Polla, D. et al., (1998). This paper presents a cooperative approach for intrusion detection that provides a method for individual ID components working cooperatively to perform concerted detections. Being constructed on the basis of ID components, CoIDS can adopt both existed (usually more mature) and new ID techniques. This makes CoIDS extensible and scalable. In addition, an ID component is essentially an autonomous agent, which makes CoIDS available with certain loss of functionality even when the intrusion detection manager does not work. Its reliability is also improved because failure of one ID component will not cause any other to stop working. Furthermore, it improved the accuracy of detection for conventional intrusions by validating analysis result with data from different ID components.","0840-7789","0-7803-7781-8","","10.1109/CCECE.2003.1226031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1226031","","Autonomous agents;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Data analysis;Decision making;Internetworking;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Prototypes;Wide area networks","Internet;cooperative systems;internetworking;safety systems","Internet;autonomous agent;computer system;concerted detection;cooperative intrusion detection system;individual ID component;information sharing;internetworking;multiple host;multiple network;widespread attack detection","","1","1","13","","","4-7 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2050685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499108","Class-association-rule mining;evolutionary computation;fuzzy membership function;intrusion detection","Data mining;Databases;Economic indicators;Fuzzy set theory;Genetic algorithms;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Tree graphs;Web and internet services","data mining;directed graphs;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;security of data","directed graph structures;fuzzy class-association-rule mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic network programming;intrusion-detection model","","20","","33","","2010-07-01","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network???s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network???s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and - he delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173452","Fiedler value;ad hoc networks;algebraic connectivity;distributed power control;topology adaptation","Ad hoc networks;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Network topology;Protocols;Robustness;Routing;Topology","","","","0","","","","","August 2015","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

On the other, the employment of cloud storage and processing capabilities can expedite the forensics process and focus the investigation onto pertinent data earlier in an investigation. This paper examines the state-of-the-art in cloud-focused, digital forensic practises for the collection and analysis of evidence and an overview of the potential use of cloud technologies to provide Digital Forensics as a Service.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2015.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299965","Cloud Computing;Cloud Forensics;Cybercrime Investigation;Digital Forensics","Cloud computing;Forensics;NIST;Security;Servers","cloud computing;digital forensics","cloud computing;cloud service;cloud storage;digital forensics as a service","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection Systems can be a pertinent solution because they can deal with the large data volumes of logs gathered from the multitude of systems and can even identify new types of attacks if based on anomaly detection. In this paper we propose an IDS model which includes two stages: feature selection with information gain and detection with Support Vector Machines (SVM). A draw-back of SVM is that its performance results are influenced by its user input parameters. Therefore, in order to better the classifier we exploit the advantages of a recent Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithm, the Bat Algorithm (BA), which we improve by enhancing its randomization with Lévy flights. We test our model for the NSL-KDD dataset and prove that it can outperform the original BA, ABC or the popular PSO.","","978-1-4799-1779-2","","10.1109/CSCS.2015.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7168448","Bat Algorithm;IDS;L??vy flights;SVM","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Silicon;Support vector machines","feature selection;optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","BA;IDS model;Lévy flights;NSL-KDD dataset;SI algorithm;SVM;anomaly intrusion detection systems;attack type identification;data volumes;feature selection;improved bat algorithm;information gain;support vector machines;swarm intelligence algorithm","","0","","21","","","27-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A FCM for a dynamic system is a signed graph consisted of relevant concepts and causal relationships/weights between the concepts in the system. With suitable weights defined by experts in the related areas, the inference of the FCM can provide meaningful modeling of the system. Thus correctness of the weights is crucial to the success of a FCM system. Normally the weights are set by experts in the related areas. Considering the possible inefficiency and subjectivity of experts when judging the weights, it is an appealing idea to generate weights automatically according to the samples obtained through observation of the system. Some training algorithms were proposed. However, to our best knowledge, few learning algorithm has been reported to generate weight matrix based on sample sequences with continuous values. In this paper, we introduce a new learning algorithm to train the weights of FCM. In the proposed algorithm, the weights are updated by gradient descent on a squared Bellman residual, which is an accepted method in machine learning. The experiment results show that given sufficient training samples, the correct weights can be approximated by the algorithm. The algorithm proposes a new way for FCM research and applications.","1098-7584","978-1-4244-7315-1","978-1-4244-7316-8","10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007485","Fuzzy cognitive maps","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Training","cognitive systems;fuzzy set theory;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence)","FCM inference;FCM system;dynamic system;fuzzy cognitive map;gradient descent;gradient residual algorithm;learning algorithm;machine learning;signed graph;squared Bellman residual;system modeling;weight matrix","","0","","19","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a cyber security incident occurs, the critical question that security administrators are concerned about is: What has happened? Cyber situation assessment is critical to making correct and timely defense decisions by the analysts. STIX ontology, which was developed by taking advantage of existing cyber security related standards, is used to represent cyber threat information and infer important features of the cyber situation that help decision makers form their situational awareness. However, due to the widespread application of information technology, security analysts face a challenge in information overload. There are still huge volumes of low level observations captured by various sensors and network tools that need to be used to derive the high level intelligence queries such as potential courses of action and future impact. Therefore, identification of the relevant cyber threat information for a specific query is a crucial procedure for cyber situation assessment. In this paper, we leverage the STIX ontology to represent cyber threat information in a logical framework. In order to recognize specific situation types and identify the minimal and sufficient information for answering a query automatically, we propose an information relevance reasoning mechanism based on situation theory. Finally, we implement our proposed framework using a dataset generated by Skaion corporation.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266729","","Cognition;Computer security;Computers;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Semantics","inference mechanisms;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data","STIX ontology;Skaion corporation;cyber security information relevance reasoning;cyber security related standards;cyber situation assessment framework;cyber threat information;defense decisions;high level intelligence queries;information overload;information technology;security analysts;situation theory;situational awareness","","","","","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless mesh network technologies with the 802.15.4, 802.11, and WiMAX standards. Each of these will expose the power grid to cybersecurity threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid-the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)-where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks. AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection. Simulation results demonstrate that this is a promising methodology for supporting the optimal communication routing and improving system security through the identification of malicious network traffic.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2159818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963752","Artificial immune system;cybersecurity;data classification;intrusion detection;smart grid;support vector machine;wireless mesh networks","Communication system security;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Wide area networks;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks","WiMax;Zigbee;artificial immune systems;computer network security;home computing;power engineering computing;smart power grids;support vector machines;wide area networks;wireless LAN;wireless mesh networks","AIS;HAN;IEEE 802.11;IEEE 802.15.4;Internet-like communications network;NAN;SGDIDS;SVM;WAN;WiMax standards;analyzing module;artificial immune system;cybersecurity threats;distributed intrusion detection system;home area networks;malicious data classification;malicious network traffic;multilayer network architecture;neighborhood area networks;optimal communication routing;power grid;smart grids;support vector machine;wide area networks;wireless mesh network technologies","","45","","54","","2011-07-28","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our aim is to develop such a system that operates on signatures extracted from execution profiles. These signatures are not descriptions of exploits, but instead are descriptions of the program conditions that lead to the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, i.e., they depend on the structure of the vulnerabilities themselves. A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures. Then, we insert probes in select locations in the application to enable online signature matching. To evaluate our technique, we implemented it for Java programs and applied it on Tomcat 3.0 in order to detect well-known attacks. Our results were promising, as no false negatives and a maximum of 4.5% false positives were observed, and the runtime overhead was less than 5%.","","978-1-4244-3725-2","","10.1109/IWSESS.2009.5068454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068454","","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Conferences;Databases;Intrusion detection;Java;Pattern matching;Probes;Runtime","Java;digital signatures;program diagnostics;security of data","Java programs;Tomcat 3.0;execution profiles;intrusion detection system;malicious behavior;online signature matching;program analysis;program statements;security mechanism;signature extraction;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","26","","","19-19 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server. Our emulated Minos systems running Linux and Windows have stopped several actual attacks.

Today's software based NIDSs (eg. Snort) show inef ciency and even fail to perform for the faster Internet. Implementing stateful TCP inspection in EPGA aims at achieving an ef cient, fast NIDS in general, - Snort speci cally. By dividing a TCP connection into two ows, one to the Sewer and another to the Client, monitoring of the TCP ow can be sped up. A TCP ow deals not only with a single packet but also with multiple packets over the network. Reassembly of those packets is one of the main tusks that the TCP ow monitoring should accomplish. By parallelizing the tasks of reassembling TCP packets on the Sewer and the Client on an EPGA, the performance of stateful TCP inspection can be greatly improved. The performance obtained by this work is a throughput of 2.75 Gbps.","","0-7803-8510-1","","10.1109/NORCHP.2004.1423841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423841","","Communication system security;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Informatics;Inspection;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","","","","0","2","9","","","8-9 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and difference distance map are used for selection of significant features. This approach is able to transform high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional domain. The similarity between new incoming packets and a normal profile is determined using Euclidean distance on the simple, low-dimensional feature domain.

Todaypsilas network traffic is so voluminous that manual inspection would be unreasonably expensive. In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer. In this paper, we present measurement algorithms for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the main protocol for Web browsing. When applied to real Web browsing traffic, the algorithms were able to discount 98.5% of measured bytes and effectively isolate information leaks.","1081-6011","978-0-7695-3633-0","","10.1109/SP.2009.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207641","Forensics;HTTP;Information Leaks;Intrusion Detection;Web Traffic","Bandwidth;Cryptography;IP networks;Inspection;Internet;Network servers;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Volume measurement","Internet;hypermedia;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;data loss prevention systems;hypertext transfer protocol;information leaks;network bandwidth;network traffic;outbound Web browsing traffic;protocol specifications","","12","1","27","","","17-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cybersecurity Applications & Technology","20090324","2009","","","230","236","The uncertainties that currently exist about the efficacy of network data anonymization, from both technical and policy perspectives, leave the research community in a vulnerable position. Even as the field marches forward, it does so with little understanding of the implications of publishing anonymized network data on the privacy of the networks being monitored and the utility to researchers. Without that understanding, data publishers are left to wonder what fields must be anonymized to avoid legal fallout, while researchers question the confidence of results gained from the data. However, the extensive work done on micro- data anonymity provides the network research community with several useful insights about how to effectively apply anonymization to published data. At the same time, prior wisdom cannot be applied directly without first overcoming several challenges, including the development of appropriate privacy and utility definitions for the more complex case of network data. Addressing these challenges is essential, in our view, to ensure the continued, yet responsible, availability of network trace data to support security research.","","978-0-7695-3568-5","","10.1109/CATCH.2009.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804449","","Computer security;Data mining;Data privacy;Data security;Information security;Law;Legal factors;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Terrorism;Testing","data privacy","anonymized network data;data publishers;network data anonymization;network privacy;security research","","10","","46","","","3-4 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing works mainly investigate the system performance given some attacking patterns. In this technical note, we investigate how an attacker should schedule its Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to degrade the system performance. Specifically, we consider the scenario where a sensor sends its data to a remote estimator through a wireless channel, while an energy-constrained attacker decides whether to jam the channel at each sampling time. We construct optimal attack schedules to maximize the expected average estimation error at the remote estimator. We also provide the optimal attack schedules when a special intrusion detection system (IDS) at the estimator is given. We further discuss the optimal attack schedules when the sensor has energy constraint. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal attack schedules.","0018-9286","","","10.1109/TAC.2015.2409905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054460","DoS attack;State estimation;energy constraint;state estimation","Channel estimation;Computer crime;Estimation error;Schedules;State estimation;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;estimation theory;optimisation;scheduling","CPS security;DoS attack;IDS;cyber-physical system security;energy-constrained attacker;expected average estimation error maximization;intrusion detection system;optimal Denial-of-Service attack scheduling;remote estimator","","0","","","","2015-03-04","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Prompt action by DNS server operators minimized the duration and impact of the attack, which had little effect on overall Internet performance. Intrusion detection systems are researched and developed to detect attacks from outside world since 1980. Intrusion detection systems create an alert data or log data when detect an intrusion. But Many IDS uses heterogeneous data set, so these data must be mapped to another format. IDWG in IETF proposed IDMEF. This paper designs an alert data format compatible IDMEF. The secure networking framework is consisted of SGS and CPCS. SGS acts as an intrusion detection system on edge of network ingress point, and CPCS acts as a higher-level server. SGS makes an alert data compatible IDMEF and sends it to CPCS. CPCS parses an IDMEF alert data and makes an alert object for using correlation analysis. SGS can see its area only, but CPCS can see wide network area. CPCS can detect more complex attacks as well as support integrated management through cooperating each other. In the view of alert processing we converted raw alert data to Ladon-alert data to support interoperability. We use IDMEF-compatible alert datat structure. We have designed and developed integrated IDS on gateway, and security control server on higher-level class. Then this framework offers cooperative intrusion detection, policy based controlling.","","0-7803-8114-9","","10.1109/APCC.2003.1274479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1274479","","Cities and towns;Computer science;Data security;Electronic mail;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;correlation methods;open systems;safety systems;telecommunication security","DNS server operators;IDMEF alert data;Internet traffic;Ladon-alert data;alert processing;correlation analysis;distributed denial-of-service;higher-level server;integrated management;intrusion detection systems;network ingress point;policy based control;secure networking;security control server","","1","","11","","","21-24 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From the definition of DDoS, thousands of network attacks must initiate simultaneously and continuously to achieve a successful DDoS attacking. Therefore, almost all of the information system cannot survive as they confront the DDoS attacks. Although there are a lot of intrusion detection system (IDS) developed, preventing DDoS attack is still difficult and perplexing. In this paper, an early warning system for detecting DDoS attacking has been mounted to a traditional IDS to form a completely system. This early warning system is developed based on the rationale of time delay neural network. In the networking topology, each node is monitored with the deployment of detectors to establish a multilayer architecture. In addition, the activities of each node will be monitored by their neighboring nodes to check whether it is still survival or not mutually. After then, all of the attacking information will be collected and transferred to the expert module for integrating analysis. As those nodes dispatched on the DMZ or between the first and second layer of firewall face some attacking similar as the pattern of DDoS, the kernel expert module which dispatched behind the second firewall will take some feasible actions and initiate the defense strategies to protect the kernel information system. In the meanwhile, those failed nodes will be restarted and act as the role of vanguard to assure the networking under normal operation.","","978-1-4244-8378-5","978-0-7695-4222-5","10.1109/IIHMSP.2010.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636160","Denial of service;Distributed denial of service;Information security;Internet hacking;Time-delay neural network","Alarm systems;Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Nonhomogeneous media;Servers","computer network security;delays;network topology;neural nets;safety systems","DDoS attack;distributed denial of service;early warning system;information security;intrusion detection system;multilayer deployment;network attack techniques;networking topology;time delay neural network","","0","","7","","","15-17 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose of this work is to provide a mechanism for detecting malicious incorrect packet forwarding attacks. To this end, a trust model extending routing protocols and based on the reputation concept is developed. Our model provides two main functionalities: monitoring the behavior of the neighboring nodes in the network and computing their reputations based on the information provided by the monitoring. This paper also discusses how the reputation information is gathered, stored and exchanged between the nodes, and computed according to the different scenarios.

However, since it still suffers from detecting an unknown attack, i.e., 0-day attack, the ultimate challenge in intrusion detection field is how we can exactly identify such an attack. Unlike the existing approaches that investigate raw traffic data, we introduced a feature extraction method in order to detect such an attack from IDS alerts [J. Song et al., 2007]. However, there is a problem that it can be only applied to limited IDS products. In this paper, we present a generalized version of the feature extraction method. To this end, we define new 7 features using only the basic 6 features of IDS alerts; detection time, source address and port, destination address and port, and signature name. In order to detect 0-day attack from IDS alerts with new 7 features, we apply an unsupervised learning technique, One-class SVM, to them. We evaluated our method over the log data of IDS that is deployed in Kyoto University, and our experimental results show that it has capability to detect not only a type of 0-day attack detected in our previous study, but also several different types of 0-day attack.","","978-0-7695-3297-4","","10.1109/SAINT.2008.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604543","","Computer security;Data security;Feature extraction;Informatics;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic;Unsupervised learning","feature extraction;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication security;unsupervised learning","0-day attack detection;cyber attacks;generalized feature extraction;intrusion detection system alerts;one-class SVM;raw traffic data;support vector machines;unknown attack detection;unsupervised learning","","5","","23","","","July 28 2008-Aug. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

EEG signals capture important information pertinent to different physiological brain states. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for evaluating the power-accuracy trade-off for EEG-based compressive sensing and classification techniques in the context of epileptic seizure detection in wireless tele-monitoring. The framework incorporates compressive sensing-based energy-efficient compression, and noisy wireless communication channel to study the effect on the application accuracy. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compressive sensing are used for EEG signals acquisition and compression. To obtain low-complexity energy-efficient, the best data accuracy with higher compression ratio is sought. A reconstructed algorithm derived from DCT of daubechie's wavelet 6 is used to decompose the EEG signal at different levels. DCT is combined with the best basis function neural networks for EEG signals classification. Extensive experimental work is conducted, utilizing four classification models. The obtained results show an improvement in classification accuracies and an optimal classification rate of about 95% is achieved when using NN classifier at 85% of CR in the case of no SNR value. The satisfying results demonstrate the effect of efficient compression on maximizing the sensor lifetime without affecting the application's accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2479-3","","10.1109/IWCMC.2013.6583564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6583564","DCT;EEG;classification;compressive sensing;feature extraction;wavelet compression","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Discrete cosine transforms;Electroencephalography;Support vector machines;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical telemetry;compressed sensing;discrete cosine transforms;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;performance evaluation;radio networks","DCT;EEG signals;EEG-based epileptic seizure detection;brain electric activities;compression-accuracy trade-off;compressive sensing;daubechie wavelet;discrete cosine transform;electroencephalogram signals;energy-efficient compression;noisy wireless communication channel;performance evaluation;wireless telemonitoring","","1","","27","","","1-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
