In order to improve the performance of IPv6 network, it is a really important task to identify and manage application traffics efficiently and exactly. Aiming at the feature of IPv6, this article analyzes several technologies of application traffic identification and raises a proposal combined with the function of PME (Pattern Matching Engine) and TLU (Table Lookup Unit) on the hardware platform of network processor MPC8572.

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a “Union then Minimize” framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a “Minimize then Union” framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers. The key to our approach is a space- and time-efficient routine for merging two compact D <sup>2</sup>FA into a compact D <sup>2</sup>FA. In our experiments, our algorithm runs on average 155 times faster and uses 1500 times less memory than previous algorithms. For example, we are able to construct a D <sup>2</sup>FA with over 80 000 000 states using only 1 GB of main memory in only 77 min.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2309014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807837","Deep packet inspection;information security;intrusion detection and prevention;network security;regular expression matching","Automata;Explosions;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Minimization;Standards","deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;telecommunication security","D<sup>2</sup>FA;NFA;RE;XFA;bypassing space explosion;delayed input DFA;deterministic finite state automata;expensive nondeterministic finite automata;extended finite automata;high-speed regular expression matching;minimize then union framework;network intrusion detection;network prevention systems;regular expression signatures;security threats;union then minimize framework","","2","","37","","2014-04-29","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we focus on the best relay selection and the optimization of the Physical-Layer Network Coding (PNC) at the relays, aiming at the throughput maximization of the network. Existing literature optimizes PNC with respect to the maximization of the minimum rate among users. The proposed strategy maximizes the sum rate of the users allowing non-symmetric rates, while the optimal solution is explored with the aid of the Pareto frontier. The problem of relay selection is matched to a coalition formation game, where the relays and the CD cooperate to maximize their profit. Efficient coalition formation algorithms are proposed, which perform joint relay selection and PNC optimization. Simulation results show that a considerable improvement is achieved compared to existing results, both in terms of the network sum rate and the players' profits.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2015.2405547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045583","Cloud Base Stations;Cloud Radio Access Networks;Cloud radio access networks;Compute-and-Forward;Cooperative Game Theory;Physical Layer Network Coding;Relay Selection;cloud base stations;compute-and-forward;cooperative game theory;physical layer network coding;relay selection","Equations;Games;Network coding;Optimization;Relays;Vectors;Wireless communication","Pareto optimisation;cloud computing;decoding;game theory;network coding;receiving antennas;relay networks (telecommunication)","CD;L antennas/relays;Pareto frontier;centralized decoder;cloud compute-and-forward;cloud network;coalition formation game;compute-and-forward protocol;decode integer equations;distributed receiving antennas;maximization;physical layer network coding;relay cooperation;relay selection;transmitted messages","","0","","32","","2015-02-19","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude. The results also show that the software implementation of our scheme without using any hardware parallelism can support up to one thousand customer VLANs and one million rules, where each rule consumes less than 60 bytes and each packet classification can be accomplished under 50 memory accesses.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.140112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689489","Packet classification;VLANs;datacenter network;firewalls;packet forwarding;router architectures;scalability","Data structures;Decision trees;Encoding;Hardware;IP networks;Indexes;Software","computer centres;firewalls;local area networks;telecommunication network routing;virtual machines","VLAN;classification rules;datacenter networks;encoded rule expansion;hardware parallelism;hash table;length combinations;packet classification;packet forwarding;storage penalty","","1","","48","","","January 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The advantages of using knowledge representation and management techniques in information security have been already identified by some researchers, however, little has been done to enable security technologies with them. We present an ontology-based multiagent architecture that implements outbound intrusion detection, a monitoring approach that aims at guaranteeing that local systems are not used to compromise others. The specific goal is to identify automated attack tools, which constitute a public, unexplored repository of software security information. An attacker-centric ontology supports the architecture. Agents organized into teams execute on trusted sub-environments called cells, which are in turn organized non-hierarchically. Cells perform two independent misuse detection strategies whose output is further correlated to provide a third, more accurate diagnosis. Ontology and signature updates are deployed over the Internet as a way to speed up incident response.","","0-7803-8735-X","","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387085","","Computer architecture;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Knowledge representation;Monitoring;Ontologies;Software tools;Technology management","Internet;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data","Internet;attacker-centric ontology;automated attack tools;information security;knowledge representation;misuse detection;ontology-based multiagent approach;outbound intrusion detection;signature updates;software security information","","4","","20","","","2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since CCR is a device which is made up three mutually orthogonal mirrors, an incident ray sent toward CCR can be reflected back in the opposite direction of the incident ray. Using this characteristic, the distance between sensor node and source can be calculated by measuring the difference in detection time of source and sink. However there is a short detection range problem because the power of ray reflected by MEMS CCR is not strong enough to be detected. So we analyze reflection process using MEMS CCR and base station, and simulate using analysis of reflected power of ray. And we suggest MEMS CCR array instead of single MEMS CCR to overcome weak power problem and analyze the power of ray reflected by MEMS CCR array.

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682694","","Conferences;Degradation;Fingerprint recognition;Games;IP networks;Probes;Security","Internet;computer network security;game theory;operating systems (computers)","DeceiveGame;Internet;Nash equilibrium;counter-fingerprinting;dynamic mechanism;game-theoretic approach;remote operating system fingerprinting;selective mechanism","","0","","19","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a set of benchmark data from a KDD (knowledge discovery and data mining) competition designed by DARPA, we demonstrate that efficient and accurate classifiers can be built to detect intrusions.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the currently existing intrusion detection algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, inefficient, and have high rates of false positives. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully cooperative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","1556-6463","978-1-4244-3805-1","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772624","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772624","","Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Protocols;Radio network;Redundancy;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","Byzantine failure of nodes;centralized monitoring points;cooperative radio network;distributed intrusion detection system;intrusion detection protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc network;routing information;transient network partitioning;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This IDS can correlate the information received from the local systems, as well as monitoring data from the Grid System, using statistical methods, to identify attacks that cannot be detected at a local level.

According to the superstatistics theory, the complex dynamic system may have a large fluctuationary of intensive quantities on large time scales which causes the system to behave as nonstationarity and nonlinearity which are also the characteristics of network traffic flows. This new idea provides us a novel way to partition the nonstationary traffic time series into small stationary segments which can be modeled by Poisson distribution in sub-second time scales. Different segments follow Poisson distribution with different distribution parameters which are named slow changing parameter compared to the fast changing traffic flows and the series of distribution parameter follows certain distribution too. We use this slow changing parameter of the segments as the key determinant factor of system to describe the network characteristic. To distinguish between the normal traffic and anomalous traffic we calculate hurst parameter of slow changing parameter. By analysing the hurst parameter series we successfully detect some of the anomalous events.","","978-0-7695-3109-0","","10.1109/CISIS.2008.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606740","","Artificial intelligence;Educational technology;Event detection;Exponential distribution;Information processing;Intelligent control;Statistical analysis;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Poisson distribution;computer networks;security of data;statistical analysis;stochastic processes;telecommunication traffic;time series","Hurst parameter series;Poisson distribution;complex dynamic system;network anomaly detection;network traffic flows;nonstationary Poisson process;superstatistics theory;time series","","0","","28","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966","","Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness","multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment","","2","","16","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Differentiated services (DiffServ) QoS model is adopted by many recent and upcoming networks standard. Applications running on these networks can specify suitable service classes to their connections or flows. The flows are then treated according to their service classes. However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2]. In this paper, we extend our framework by introducing new features that can be effectively used to classify legacy flows. The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms. Average correctness up to 98.82% is achieved when the framework is used to learn and classify unseen flows from the same user. Cross-user classifications yield average correctness up to 74.15%.","","978-953-6114-93-1","978-953-6114-95-5","10.1109/SOFTCOM.2007.4446129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446129","","Application software;Communication standards;Communications technology;Computer science;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Throughput","DiffServ networks;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","automatic flow classification;differentiated services;legacy flow classification;machine learning;network standard;packet-level data","","2","","30","","","27-29 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The higher the numbers of nodes that trust each other in the network means the higher successful communication process rates could be expected. To determine trust, there are several criteria need to be considered. These criteria which are also known as features or evidences can be used to represent each node's trust properties in the trust evaluation process prior to initiating certain packet forwarding task. Nodes that are able to present valid features requested by source node will be included in the MANET operations. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of security vulnerabilities in MANET and the use of trust concept to enhance the security.

Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which recognizes a set of regular expressions, is the basic data structure to scan input traffic byte by byte. Though DFA meets the requirement of real-time processing of network traffic, constructing a combined DFA for a set of regular expression signatures is very time-consuming, especially when the signature set is large. To attack this problem, we propose new strategies to accelerate DFA construction. The basic idea of our method is to construct the combined DFA by hierarchical merging of the DFAs of each single regular expression. Our method runs in O(|Q||Σ| In n) time, which is substantially superior to the time complexity O(|Q||Σ|(Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>|Qi|)<sup>2</sup>) of classical subset construction algorithm.

The approach taken is to assume that the defender's goal is to thwart attackers by enact optimal tactical responses. It is then shown that, even in an idealized environment, the defender has no guarantee that the correlation system's estimates of the enacted attacks are correct. A theoretical path always exists by which the attacker can influence the contents of the correlation system's low-level alert clusters. As these low-level clusters form the basis of all higher level analyses, this is sufficient to show that the attacker has influence over the tactical assessments reported by correlation systems. In essence, the attackers can cause the defender to mis-correlate an attack's generated INFOSEC alerts in a manner which can go undetected and is to the attacker's advantage. This capability is shown to hinge on there being attacks whose identification requires the analysis of shared alerts (i.e., alerts generated by two or more distinct attacks).","","0-7803-9427-5","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532055","","Councils;Fasteners;Game theory;Large-scale systems;Performance analysis;Pressing;Production;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","military communication;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security","network security;standard alert correlation systems;tactical assessments;timing characteristics","","0","","23","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By plotting the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves induced by the traffic activity, we quantify the effectiveness of network activity models in discriminating normal connections from attack connections generated by denial-of-service and probing attacks. It is verified that denial-of-service and probing attacks leave traces on simple network activity models, with rates of false alarm which are comparable to the false alarm rates obtained by the participants of the 1998 DARPA evaluation, in which much more complex detection schemes were utilized. For application models, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to show that attacks using telnet connections in the DARPA data set form a population which is statistically different from the normal telnet connections.

However, the present DDoS attack detection techniques face a problem that they cannot distinguish flooding attacks from abrupt changes of legitimate activity. We discover that the traffic at one time is similar to that at the same time in different days under no attacks but its abrupt changes will occur under attacking. Based on this phenomenon, we propose a model for detecting DDOS attacks automatically. In order to reduce the error to identify attacks, we use discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique. In the end, we use actual data to validate our model and obtain good results in terms of tradeoff between correct detections and false alarms.","","978-1-4244-4129-7","978-1-4244-4131-0","10.1109/CISP.2009.5300903","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5300903","","Computer crime;Computer security;Discrete wavelet transforms;Face detection;Information science;Internet;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","discrete wavelet transforms;security of data","DDoS attacks;DWT;Internet;attack detection techniques;correct detections;discrete wavelet transform technique;distributed denial-of-service attacks;false alarms;flooding attacks;wavelet analysis","","1","","26","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the last years these threats have reached a new quality of automatization and sophistication, rendering most defenses ineffective. Conventional security measures that rely on the manual analysis of security incidents and attack development inherently fail to provide a timely protection from these threats. As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses. In this paper, we reconsider the problems, challenges and advantages of combining machine learning and computer security. We identify factors that are critical for the efficacy and acceptance of learning methods in security.

In this paper, we propose to develop and implement a lightweight Security Framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) that combines the advantages of both cryptography and IDS techniques to assure the privacy of communication and detect the most dangerous attacks such as spoofed, altered or replayed routing information, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator. According to our simulation results, our framework outperforms other security frameworks proposed in the literature in terms of detection rate, false positive rate, energy consumption and average efficiency.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883886","Attacks;Intrusion detection systems;Symmetric cryptography;Wireless sensor networks","Encryption;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","TOSSIM simulator;average efficiency;cryptography techniques;detection rate;energy consumption;external attacks;false positive rate;internal attacks;intrusion detection systems;lightweight hybrid security framework;malicious node;privacy of communication;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are often deployed in complex dynamic systems that provide users with broad access privileges, but also leave the system vulnerable to various attacks. Techniques to detect threats originating from beyond the system are relatively mature, but methods to detect insider threats are still evolving. A promising class of insider threat detection models for CIS focus on the communities that manifest between users based on the usage of common subjects in the system. However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions).

The key of this approach is to model the components of the system as autonomous agents and to simulate their behavior for evaluating the system as a whole. That is very useful for observing the emergence of properties in social, biological, environmental or financial systems, among others. Artificial immune systems, which is a sub field of artificial intelligence, comprises systems modeled by simplifying models from the biological immune system. If agent-based modeling and simulation is used as a laboratory for understanding the biological immune system then, it can also be used for transferring the observed principles into artificial immune system models or for evaluating models that have been already adapted for solving technical problems. This paper presents first, a methodology for transferring principles of the biological immune system into the field of artificial immune systems.

Our design is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. By exploiting this heterogeneity, expensive operations can be delegated to mesh routers, which help alleviate the overhead of mesh clients during key establishment. The new scheme possesses two desirable features: (1) Neighbor mesh clients can directly establish pairwise keys; and (2) Communication and storage costs at mesh clients are significantly reduced.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654744","Deployment knowledge;Matrix;Pairwise key;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Knowledge engineering;Security;Symmetric matrices;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","matrix algebra;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","WMN;adversarial activities;communication costs;deployment knowledge;eavesdropping;matrix-based pairwise key establishment scheme;mesh routers;neighbor mesh clients;security issue;storage costs;wireless mesh networks;wireless transmission","","1","","16","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection. A new match rule is introduced, called r-chunks, and the generalizations induced by different partial matching rules are characterized in terms of the crossover closure. Permutations of the representation can be used to achieve more precise discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns.

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference.

Smart home is one of the emerging examples for pervasive computing applications. In a smart home scenario, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can potentially provide information about device activities and their status. This information can be useful for variety of purposes like monitoring home security, examining status of nodes, and replacing nodes that are malfunctioning or dead. The sensor network needs to be protected from intrusions and anomalies. Over the years, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed for preventing WSNs from intrusions. Although some mobile agent based IDS are proposed, anomaly detection for wireless smart home sensor network (WSHSN) is not fully exploited. In this article, we have proposed a mobile agent based anomaly detection mechanism for WSHSNs. The proposed scheme takes advantage from heterogeneous nature of devices in smart home for effectively detecting anomalies. The anomaly detection infrastructure is installed at resource rich nodes such as Cluster Heads (CHs).The mobile agent takes only few bytes of data to further assess the anomalous behavior of suspicious node. The analysis and comparative study show several advantages of the proposed scheme, such as efficient utilization of memory, reducing network load, and reduction in overall computational cost of the network. The nature of our proposed solution is generic, so that as it is, or with slight modifications, it can be implemented on other heterogeneous wireless sensor networks.","","978-1-4673-3084-8","","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2012.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332015","anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;mobile Agent;pervasive computing;wireless smart home sensor network","","home computing;mobile agents;security of data;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","CH;IDS;WSHSN;WSN;cluster heads;device activities;home security;intrusion detection systems;memory utilization;mobile agent based anomaly detection;network load reduction;node replacement;node status examination;overall computational cost reduction;pervasive computing applications;suspicious node anomalous behavior;wireless smart home sensor networks","","3","","23","","","4-7 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Malicious nodes can attack the network by jamming, selectively forwarding packets, black-hole attack and spoofing. In the case of statically deployed, dense Wireless Sensor Networks which use flat routing, alternate path for secure transmission on packets across such malicious nodes have to be found. Scattering multiple copies of the packets in order to reach the sink, leads to more network and energy inefficiency. Moreover, collusion of malicious nodes is addressed vaguely by literature. In this paper, we propose a secure routing methodology which semi-randomly propagates a packet in the shortest path to the Sink by circumventing the malicious nodes. Extensive simulations show that the number of broadcast hops, activity of network and the packet drop ratio are significantly lesser for the proposed routing technique. Simulations also prove that the proposed technique handles collusion of malicious nodes more efficiently.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972317","collusion;malicious node;secure routing;wireless sensor networks","Conferences;Dispersion;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","black-hole attack;broadcast hops;denial-of-service attacks;energy inefficiency;flat routing;malicious nodes;packet drop ratio;secure routing methodology;semirandomised propagation;static wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The distribution of vulnerable hosts on the Internet, however, is highly non-uniform over the IP-address space. This implies that random scanning wastes many scans on invulnerable addresses, and more virulent scanning schemes may take advantage of the non-uniformity of a vulnerable-host distribution. Questions then arise how attackers may make use of such information, and how virulent the resulting worm may be. These issues provide ""worst-case scenarios"" for defenders and ""best-case scenarios"" for attackers if the vulnerable-host distribution is available. This work develops such a scenario as the so-called importance scanning. Importance scanning results from importance sampling in statistics that scans IP-address space according to an empirical distribution of vulnerable hosts. An analytical model is developed to relate the infection rate of worms with the importance-scanning strategies. Experimental results based on parameters chosen from code red and slammer worms show that an importance-scanning worm can spread much faster than both a random-scanning worm and a routing worm. Furthermore, a game-theory approach suggests that the best strategy for defenders is to scatter applications uniformly in the entire IP-address space.","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577955","","Analytical models;Application software;Computer worms;Internet;Monte Carlo methods;Probability;Routing;Scattering;Space technology;Statistical distributions","IP networks;Internet;game theory;importance sampling;invasive software;telecommunication security","IP-address space;Internet worms;code red;game-theory approach;importance sampling;importance-scanning worm;random-scanning worm;routing worm;scanning schemes;slammer worms;vulnerable hosts;vulnerable-host distribution","","8","1","19","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ACSAC '06. 22nd Annual","20061226","2006","","","235","244","Active worms pose major security threats to the Internet. In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, i.e., camouflaging worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm has the capability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time, thereby camouflaging its propagation from existing worm detection systems. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and non-worm traffic. We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain, however, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm.

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead.","","978-1-4244-4153-2","978-0-7695-3650-7","10.1109/MDM.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088926","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Detection algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Training data;Uncertainty;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;inference mechanisms;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;outlier detection;security","","9","","41","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999911","Android Malware;Android malware;Behavioral Analysis;Dynamic Analysis;Obfuscation;Static Analysis;Stealth Malwar;behavioral analysis;dynamic analysis;obfuscation;static analysis;stealth malware","Androids;Google;Humanoid robots;Malware;Smart phones;Tutorials","Android (operating system);application program interfaces;invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;smart phones","API;Android device;Android malware application;Internet;SMS;application programming interface;dynamic-analysis-based method;location-based service;malware detection techniques;malware penetration;multimedia services;next-generation Android security enforcement mechanism;office application;prevalent stealth techniques;signature-based analysis method;smartphone OS security;static analysis method;static analysis methods;vehicle guidance;voice call","","0","","143","","2014-12-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, we find that one out of 27 hosts is potentially a scanning source among 2<sup>32</sup> IPv4 addresses. We then show that malicious sources have a persistent, non-uniform spatial distribution. That is, more than 80% of the sources send packets from the same 20% of the IPv4 address space over time. We also find that 7.3% of malicious source addresses are unroutable, and that some source addresses are correlated. Next, we show that most sources have a short lifetime. 57.9 % of the source addresses appear only once in the trace, and 90% of source addresses appear less than 5 times.

A second line of defense is required to provide intrusion detection and response techniques in protecting the OLSR protocol against attacks from inside intruders. In this paper, we describe security threats to the OLSR MANET routing protocol and present an intrusion detection solution based on protocol semantics checking. Our approach is based on semantic properties that are implied in the protocol definition and specify the correct OLSR routing update behavior. Conflict checking based on semantic properties is applied in every MANET node. Any abnormal protocol semantics triggers an intrusion alarm.

Instead, we address another issue: the scalability of DFAs to parallel systems and their buffer requirements. To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted. This scheme is the first in literature that proposes effective parallelization of DFA walk, hence allowing for packet processing time reduction and less memory for reordering buffers. The result is that speed scales as the number of processing units.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-9266-4","978-1-4244-9267-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134010","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Instruction sets;Memory management;Multicore processing;Synchronization","buffer storage;deterministic automata;finite automata;inspection;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;pattern matching;performance evaluation;sampling methods;security of data","DFA parallelization;buffer reordering;buffer requirements;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;multicore systems;packet processing time reduction;parallel systems;regular expression matching performance;sampling technique;text expression","","0","","14","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work presents a technique whereby the operator, using visualization alone, is able to display the full picture of events occurring in the network.

At the same time, research on the accelerating algorithm of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction has also been conducted, and a 3D spatial filtering method is proposed to filter the 3D reconstruction model.

With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","978-0-7695-4521-9","10.1109/ANCS.2011.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729","Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput","automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching","Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead","","1","","27","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are those kinds of monitoring tools that have gained a considerable amount of popularity, A number of specification-based IDSs have been proposed, where security requirements or attack scenarios are specified using some languages. Currently, attack specification languages are being deployed for describing security requirements. Use of two different languages for software specification and security specification invites a number of unwanted but complicated issues, such as duplication of requirements specification effort as well as the existence of redundant and conflicting requirements. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection technique that uses a formal software specification language called abstract state machine language (AsmL) for the specification of security requirements. We present a framework, and develop the algorithm for the IDS that interprets the AsmL attack scenario specifications in order to detect intrusions.

Many techniques are exploited in Traffic Classification. Among them, machine learning has grown considerably attention because of its accuracy. Feature selection chooses feature combinations for machine learning algorithms, and has significant influence on the accuracy and efficiency. To discover optimal features, all possible combinations need to be evaluated by testing real classifiers. With numerous features, feature selection can cost an abundance of time and computational resources. This paper proposes a feature selection algorithm for C4.5 Decision Tree. This algorithm utilizes structural characteristics of C4.5 algorithm to exclude some of the combinations without actually testing the classifiers. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can reduce the number of tests in seeking the optimal feature combination.","","","","10.1109/INCoS.2013.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630283","C4.5 Decision Tree;Feature Selection;Machine Learning;Traffic Classification","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Machine learning algorithms;Testing;Training;Upper bound","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile communication;telecommunication computing","C4.5 decision tree;RangeTree algorithm;feature selection algorithm;fine-grained network management;machine learning;mobile network;traffic classification;traffic detection","","1","","18","","","9-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the static model is no longer appropriate due to the fluctuation nature of the number of alerts incurred by Internet traffic fluctuation nature. This paper proposes an efficient real time adaptive intrusion detection alert classifier dedicated for high speed network. Our classifier is based an online self-trained SVM algorithm with several learning strategies and execution modes. We evaluate our classifier against three different data-sets and the performance study shows an excellent results in term of accuracy and efficiency.
