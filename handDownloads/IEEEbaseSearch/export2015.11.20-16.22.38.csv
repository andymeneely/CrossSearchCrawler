It has the ability to detect and predict with a high accuracy a future malicious behavior of an attacker. This is unlike the current detection scheÃÅmas, where there is no prevention technique since they aim to detect only current attackers that occur in the network. We used game theory concept to predict the future behavior of the monitored vehicle and categorize it into the appropriate list (White, White & Gray, Gray, and Revocation_Black) according to its predicted attack severity. In this paper, our aim is to prevent from the most dangerous attack that targets a vehicular network, which is false alert's generation attack. Simulation results show that our intrusion detection and prevention schema exhibits a high detection rate and generates a low false positive rate.

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","","978-1-4244-5175-3","978-1-4244-5176-0","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","0","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each time. The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses. Asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the composite hypotheses case, where there is uncertainty in the distribution parameters. Simulation results then illustrate the performance of the algorithms.","","","","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6736855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736855","Anomaly detection;intrusion detection;sequential hypothesis testing","Approximation methods;Error probability;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Testing;Uncertainty","computer network security;minimisation;probability;statistical testing","abnormal components;abnormal independent component;abnormal state;anomalous component;anomaly localization;asymptotically optimal low-complexity algorithms;component priorities;composite hypothesis;distribution parameter uncertainty;distribution parameters;error probability constraints;expected weighted completion time sum minimization;independent model;normal component;optimal index policies;overall network damage reduction;resource-constrained cyber network","","4","","24","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased. The model is verified on the dataset taken from KDD99Cup which is a standard dataset used for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8862-9","978-0-9564263-6-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678024","","","computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;R-to-L intrusion detection system;evolutionary techniques;feature extraction;incremental genetic algorithm;machine learning;network security;pattern classification;remote-to-local attack detection;standard dataset","","0","","18","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As Internet telephony becomes more and more popular, attackers will attempt to exhaustively ""test"" implementations' robustness, transmitting various types of malformed messages to them. Since it is almost infeasible to avoid or predict every potential error caused during the developing process of these subsystems, it is necessary to specify an appropriate and robust, from the security point of view, framework that will facilitate the successful detection and handling of any kind of malformed messages aiming to destruct the provided service.

It is at the forefront of many networks. Massively used protocols like IP, ARP do not have any mechanism for protection against malicious activities by the network clients due to which IP and ARP spoofing are used by attackers to launch various kinds of attacks such as Man In The Middle (MITM), Denial of Service (DoS) and other attacks. These attacks can have the threatening effects on the organizations. Detection, mitigation and prevention of IP-ARP spoofing can enhance the security to great extent. This paper presents several schemes for detecting, mitigating and preventing ARP Spoofing attacks. The important features and limitations of the already reported methods have been highlighted in this paper and the suggestions for further improvement towards the development of an ideal solution have been examined.","","978-1-4799-7676-8","","10.1109/EESCO.2015.7253748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7253748","ARP Cache;ARP Protocol;ARP Spoofing Attack;Spoofing detection and prevention","Authentication;Computers;Hardware;IP networks;Monitoring;Protocols","IP networks;computer network security;protocols","ARP spoofing attack detection;ARP spoofing attack mitigation;ARP spoofing attack prevention;IP-ARF spoofing;address resolution protocol","","0","","","","","24-25 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these machine learning schemes are rarely employed in large-scale practical settings. In this paper, we implement and compare machine learning schemes of neural networks, SVM and decision trees in a uniform environment with the purpose of exploring the practice and issues of using these approaches in detecting abnormal behaviors. With the analysis of experimental results, we claim that the real performance of machine learning algorithms depends heavily on practical context.

By interacting with a system, an insider plays games with the security mechanisms employed to protect it. We apply game theory to model these interactions in an extensive form game, that is being played repeatedly with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The outcomes of the game are quantified by specifying players' preferences and by assigning numbers to reflect these preferences. Examining players' best responses, the solution of the game follows by locating all the Nash Equilibria (NE). We extend the NE notion to the logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), to capture players' bounded rationality. The QRE results are more realistic and show that the solution of the game might be significantly different than the corresponding NE solution.

The security of the outsourced data in the cloud is dependent on the security of the cloud computing system and network. Though, there have been numerous efforts on securing data on the cloud computing system, evaluation of data security on the network between cloud provider and its users is still a very challenging task. The audit of the cloud computing system and network will provide insights on the security and performance of VMs and the operating system on multiple data centers and the intra-cloud network managed by cloud providers and the wide-area network between the cloud user and cloud provider. Thus, network traffic analysis for cloud auditing is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to verify the data security on the network between cloud provider and its users.

Algorithms are used to analyze potential consequences, the relative importance of targets to the adversary, and security vulnerability levels, to arrive at a relative risk for each threat and target combination. Countermeasures are then developed to minimize the risk and the methodology is reapplied to determine the relative risk reduction achieved. This iterative process is continued until the most cost-effective method for reducing risk to an acceptable level is identified. The airport modeling and characterization is documented by recording data and performing calculations through use of a spreadsheet during table-top discussions of the scenarios.

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.","","978-1-4244-8448-5","978-0-7695-4236-2","10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852","ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence","Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation","computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems","biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator","","0","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion.

These vital signs are periodically reported back to a monitor using agents we designed for effective reporting (ER). These ER agents are installed in hosts and routers throughout the network. To minimize communications overhead, we achieve a size reduction of the raw, XML health reports by over 98% in a short-list, delta-set update. As a result, a 1.07 MB update was reduced to only 3,756 B.

In the present trend of self-organizing and self-protecting system, a special type of IDS that operates by non-supervised learning is an interesting approach. This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests. The proposed method is completely self-organized, and does not require configuration or signature updates to prepare the IDS to detect new forms of attacks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method yield fewer false positive alerts when compared to similar non-supervised methods in the literature.","","978-1-4673-6425-6","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632070","Intrusion detection;anomaly-based detection;clustering;security","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Training;Web servers","Internet;file servers;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;self-adjusting systems;statistical analysis;transport protocols","HTTP access patterns;clustering-based method;data clustering;heuristic method;intrusion detection systems;nonsupervised IDS;nonsupervised learning;protecting Web servers;self-organizing system;self-protecting system;web servers","","0","","19","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","","978-1-4244-4678-0","978-0-7695-3760-3","10.1109/LADC.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325","Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks","Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes","security of data","Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach","","3","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Now-a-days intrusion detection systems have become a standard component in security infrastructures. Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular problems. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present RIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces most of the problems contained by the previous systems.

Replication of data collection devices is employed to deal with such failures, with voting among the replica devices to move a correct data to the end-user. Here, the data being voted upon can be large-sized and/or take long time to be compiled (such as images in a terrain surveillance system and transaction histories in an intrusion detection system). The goal of our paper is to engineer the voting protocols to achieve good performance while meeting the reliability requirements of data delivery in a high assurance setting. The performance metrics are the data transfer efficiency (DTE) and the time-to-complete a data delivery (TTC). DTE captures the network bandwidth wasted and/or the energy drain in wireless-connected devices; whereas, TTC depicts the degradation in user-level QoS due to delayed and/or missed data deliveries. So, improving both DTE and TTC is a goal of our performance engineering exercise. Our protocol-level optimizations focus on reducing: i) the movement of user-level data between voters, ii) the number of voting actions/messages generated, and iii) the latency caused by the voting itself. The paper describes these optimizations, along with the experimental results from a prototype voting system.","","978-1-4244-1796-4","978-1-4244-1797-1","10.1109/COMSWA.2008.4554452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4554452","","Data engineering;Embedded system;History;Intrusion detection;Power engineering and energy;Protocols;Real time systems;Reliability engineering;Surveillance;Voting","distributed processing;embedded systems;optimisation;protocols;quality of service;telecommunication network reliability","data transfer efficiency;distributed embedded system;high assurance data collection systems;network bandwidth;performance engineering;protocol-level optimizations;reliability requirements;replica voting protocols;time-to-complete metric;user-level QoS;wireless-connected devices","","3","","11","","","6-10 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Now the research is going on On-Line Updates for local agents and global agents individually in high data rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), when the network has maximum mobility and maximum data rate.","","978-1-4673-0270-8","","10.1109/ICCCA.2012.6179178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179178","Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes;Intrusion Detection;Key management;Wireless Sensor Networks","Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Noise measurement;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","error statistics;protocols;self-adjusting systems;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DYDOG;WSN;data flow;dynamic intrusion detection node;dynamic intrusion detection protocol model;global agent;high error rate wireless sensor network;intrusion monitoring node;local agent;maximum data rate;maximum mobility;network attack;one-hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;physical environment;secure session key management;self-organizing sensor node;two hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;wireless environment","","3","","11","","","22-24 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since it is too expensive for many application systems to rebuild and embed such modules, the paper proposes an economical solution which can identify the database operation source close to the fact. The advantage of the algorithm is its support to bypass monitoring mode, which needs no change to existed application systems and is more economical than embedded audit modules.

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536","intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering","Costs;Engines;Face detection;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Reconfigurable architectures;Scalability;Software performance;Throughput","computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security","DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture","","1","","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control.

Experiment results on KDDCUP 99 datasets show that our scheme achieves high detection rate for R2L or U2R intrusions and significantly low false positive rate compared with one class SVM alone.

They pose a serious challenge to the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which heavily rely on inspecting the network packet fields and are consequently unable to monitor encrypted sessions. IDSs can be broadly categorized into two types: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. The signature-based IDSs rely on previous attack signatures but are often ineffective against new attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based detection systems depend on detecting the change in the protocol behavior caused by an attack. The latter can be employed to detect novel attacks, and therefore are often preferred over their signature-based counterpart. In this paper, we envision an anomaly-based IDS which can detect attacks against popular encrypted protocols, such as SSH and SSL. The proposed system creates a normal behavior profile and uses non-parametric Cusum algorithm to detect deviation from the normal profile. Upon detecting an anomaly, the proposed mechanism generates an alert, sets a delay to the protocol response, and traces back the attacker. The effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme is verified via simulations.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288876","","Access protocols;Authentication;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Databases;Delay;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Transport protocols","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security","anomaly-based detection systems;attack signatures;encrypted protocols;intrusion detection systems;nonparametric Cusum algorithm;packet network;secure socket layer;signature-based systems","","4","","15","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, legal issues must be considered due to piracy associated with P2P applications. P2P effects are especially harmful in corporate, institutional and government networks that do not want to assume the responsibility to carry this type of data traffic. This paper presents an extensive analysis of eDonkey protocol that is one of the most popular P2P protocols. The analysis is focused on studying those important characteristics that allow understanding its behavior. A methodology to identify efficiently the associated TCP flows is also proposed.

Instead, the mobile nodes forward packets to each others, allowing communication among nodes outside wireless transmission range. In this dynamic network, each node is considered as a mobile router but in an energy-conserving manner. This fact makes node an active element in the network which is able of the best and of the worst. Actually, a malicious node can easily disrupt the proper functioning of the routing by simply refusing to forward routing message (misbehavior node), inject the wrong routing packets, modifying others, etc. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol for wireless ad-hoc network based on multi-agent systems and particularly on ant behavior. The novelty of our protocol relies in the fact that, apparently for the first time, a protocol combines at the same time routing on one side and trust level and reputation between nodes on the other side. This combination permits to increase the security of route establishment. More generally, this protocol opens the door to the use of different agents for obtaining different mixed functionalities, routing and trust level in this paper but also other functionalities like key-distribution.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529460","","Ad hoc networks;Ant colony optimization;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Femtocell networks;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Multiagent systems;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;multi-agent systems;routing protocols;security of data","AntTrust;ant behavior;ant routing protocol;mobile nodes;mobile router;multi agent systems;trust;wireless ad hoc network","","0","","20","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 19th International Symposium on","20081208","2008","","","1","5","Recently, Personal Networks (PNs) have been focused in supporting the userpsilas business and private activities without jeopardizing privacy and security of the users and their data. The support in business and private activities will take place through the userpsilas own personal network consisting of a core Personal Area Network (PAN) extended with clusters of remote devices which could be private, shared, or public and able to adapt to the quality of the network accessed. The extended PAN with its cluster communication with another PN forms a Federation of Personal Networks (PN-F). PN-F is a secure cooperation between different PNs, making services and resources available for the purpose of achieving a common goal, increasing the security requirements and challenges. The communication in this scenario can happen in various places (home, work, public places), involving various types of network infrastructure, between various types of hardware, and exchanging any kind of service. Context aware security manager (CASM) has been proposed to solve the PN security issue, putting all the security decision in the gateway between PAN and cluster or PN and another PN. CASM relies on providing security policy based on the context being given by user. So far, algorithm regarding how to input the context has not yet been defined. Furthermore, how CASM react upon the context in deciding what security action should be performed has also not yet been elaborated. This paper will analyze the impact of context to security. The paper will work as a continuation of CASM by elaborating further a proposed algorithm on defining the context parameters, quantifying context parameter so that CASM can make decision upon it, and optimizing the matrix of context information.","","978-1-4244-2643-0","978-1-4244-2644-7","10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4699962","Ad Hoc Network;Communication System Security;Personal Communication Network;Protocols","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Communication system security;Context awareness;Data security;Hardware;Information security;Personal area networks;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","internetworking;personal area networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","business activity;context aware security manager;context information matrix;decision making;gateway;personal area network security;private activity;remote device","","0","","9","","","15-18 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The tool automates the creation of efficient field programmable gate array architectures (FPGA). The generated hardware allows an FPGA-based system to perform deep-packet inspection of streams at up to 10 Gb/s line rates at a high level of area efficiency. Going beyond previous basic string-matching implementations that offer only single-string matching, the architecture provides support for rules requiring complex, linked (correlated-content) constructions.

It introduces our research addressing privacy in the design of one such system funded by the European Commission's FP7 Programme. Debates surrounding national security and privacy involve policy makers, regulators, academics, security engineers and the public. A proposal from the designer of the Privacy by Design framework is discussed and the paper concludes by challenging policy makers, researchers and the technology industry to review and develop such proposals and enable the protection of national security and privacy.","","","","10.1109/ETHICS.2014.6893417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6893417","","Data privacy;Europe;Government;National security;Privacy;Surveillance","critical infrastructures;data protection;decision making;national security;terrorism","European Commission FP7 Programme;communication network;critical infrastructure network protection system;data protection;ethical principle;financial services;national security;organized crime;policy maker;privacy protection;public safety;terrorism;traffic management systems","","0","","24","","","23-24 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First we provide preliminary investigation results establishing program based anomaly detection is effective if short system call sequences are modeled along with their occurrence frequency. Second as a consequence of this, built normal program model can tolerate some level of contamination in the training dataset. We describe an experimental system Sequencegram, designed to validate the contributions. Sequencegram model short sequences of system calls in the form of n-grams and store in a tree (for the space efficiency) called as n-gram-tree. A score known as anomaly score is associated with every short sequence (based on its occurrence frequency) which represents the probability of short sequence being anomalous. As it is generally assumed that, there is a skewed distribution of normal and abnormal sequences, more frequently occurring sequences are given lower anomaly score and vice versa. Individual n-gram anomaly score contribute to the anomaly score of a program trace.","","978-1-4244-8952-7","978-1-4244-8951-0","10.1109/COMSNETS.2011.5716416","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5716416","Intrusion detection system;Program based anomaly detection;n-gram based analysis","Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Testing;Training;Windows","security of data;sequences;telecommunication security","abnormal sequences;program based anomaly detection;sequencegram model short sequences;system calls;training dataset","","2","","19","","","4-8 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Completion of intrusion detection task in bounded time at the sensors is also important to detect complex and co-ordinated attack patterns. Existing Linux based packet capturing solutions, NAPI and PFRING, are inefficient and have poor real-time performance. We have implemented a user space network interface (DMA ring) to capture packets under high network load on a modest commodity platform.

Many intrusion detection systems have been proposed and most of them are tightly related to routing protocols, such as Watchdog/Pathrater and Routeguard. These solutions include two parts: intrusion detection (Watchdog) and response (Pathrater and Routeguard). Watchdog resides in each node and is based on overhearing. Through overhearing, each node can detect the malicious action of its neighbors and report other nodes. However, if the node that is overhearing and reporting itself is malicious, then it can cause serious impact on network performance. In this paper, we overcome the weakness of Watchdog and introduce our intrusion detection system called ExWatchdog. The main feature of the proposed system is its ability to discover malicious nodes which can partition the network by falsely reporting other nodes as misbehaving and then proceeds to protect the network. Simulation results show that our system decrease the overhead greatly, though it does not increase the throughput obviously.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288867","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communications Society;Computer networks;Information science;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","Pathrater;Routeguard;Watchdog;intrusion detection system;mobile wireless ad hoc networks;routing protocols","","14","","11","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The security problems in broadband networks are discussed widely and frequently. There exit various network security protection tools, such as firewall, IDS (intrusion detection system), leak scanning and so on. All these tools deal with packet heads, not with detailed packet content. But some attacks, for example, guessing password, can only be examined in packet content. This paper presents a broadband network monitoring system (BBNMS) based on Libnids, which is an implementation of an e-component of network intrusion detection system. In the system not only packet heads but packet contents can be analyzed. The paper has explored three main topics: packet content analysis, packet real-time analyzing with optimized programming technologies and enhancing Libnidspsila function to detect PPPoE protocol packets of broadband network. Empirical results illustrate that the intrusion detection model can detect intrusion more accurately.","","978-0-7695-3687-3","","10.1109/NISS.2009.213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5260848","computer application;network monitor;network security","Broadband communication;Educational institutions;Functional programming;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Monitoring;Paper technology;Programming profession;Protection;Protocols","broadband networks;telecommunication security","Libnids;PPPoE protocol packets;Winpcap;broadband network monitoring system;network intrusion detection system;network security protection tools;packet content analysis;packet real-time analyzing","","0","","7","","","June 30 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
