Higher performance makes embedded software more complex, but to satisfy user demands and that of time-to-market, it has to be developed fast and achieve quality. Testing is the most important factor in embedded software development. Increasing complexity of the embedded system makes difficult to test manually and properly evaluate quality. This made automated testing becoming popular and in turn decline of manual testing. Because of the characteristics of embedded software, automated testing has difficulty performing all relevant tests and evaluation of the areas of concern. Manual testing of embedded software is affective in these areas and can directly affect quality of software. To properly test software manually it is necessary to have the proper testing procedures and personnel along with a well defined description of the system. In this paper we propose a manual testing mechanism that is more structured, effective and will improve quality of embedded software. We describe the model which is based on the existing problem of manual testing and analysis requirements. The model and technique we propose will make testing on software and related hardware areas more effective, and the way to share the testing experience and using quality evaluation.","","978-0-7695-3131-1","","10.1109/ICIS.2008.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529868","","Automatic testing;Costs;Embedded software;Embedded system;Hardware;Performance evaluation;Software quality;Software testing;System testing;Time to market","embedded systems;formal specification;program testing;software process improvement;software quality","embedded software;manual testing;requirements analysis;software quality evaluation","","0","","9","","","14-16 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multipattern matching is known to require intensive memory accesses and is often a performance bottleneck. Hence, specialized hardware-accelerated algorithms are required for line-speed packet processing. We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory. Furthermore, we modify this algorithm to be able to handle arbitrarily large strings at the cost of a little more on-chip memory.

For example, Linux 2.6 includes the Linux security modules (LSM) framework that enables the enforcement of MAC policies (e.g., type enforcement or multi-level security) for individual systems. While this is a start, we envision that MAC enforcement should span multiple machines. The goal is to be able to control interaction between applications on different machines based on MAC policy. In this paper, we describe a recent extension of the LSM framework that enables labeled network communication via IPsec that is now available in mainline Linux as of version 2.6.16. This functionality enables machines to control communication with processes on other machines based on the security label assigned to an IPsec security association. We outline a security architecture based on labeled IPsec to enable distributed MAC authorization. In particular, we examine the construction of a xinetd service that uses labeled IPsec to limit client access on Linux 2.6.16 systems.

They generally want to avoid honeypots since it is hard to spread attacks from them, attacks are thoroughly monitored on them, and some honeypots contain planted false information. This suggests that it could be useful for a computer system to pretend it is a honeypot, to scare away smarter attackers. We examine here from a number of perspectives how this could be accomplished as a kind of ""vaccination"" of systems to reduce numbers of attacks and their severity. We develop a mathematical model of what would make an attacker go away. We report experiments with deliberate distortions on text to see at what point people could detect deception, and discover they can respond to subtle clues. We also report experiments with real attackers against a honeypot of increasing obviousness. Results show that attacks on it decreased over time which may indicate that attackers are being scared away.

An efficient pattern matching algorithm plays an important role in NIDS. There have been many proposed methods for pattern matching algorithms. Traditionally, the multi-character NFA that is capable of matching multiple characters per cycle can be built by duplicating entire circuit of 1-character architecture. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing based architecture to improve the original multi-character architecture. The design of the proposed architecture and its implementation in FPGA are described in details. Our simulation results show that the proposed architecture performs better than all the existing Brute-Force based approaches in terms of the throughput and the slice utilization.

An ANC can be used to handle some of the information processing conventionally done inside the enterprise networks. ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.","1545-0678","978-1-4673-1423-7","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258190","","Delay;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Inspection;Logic gates;Optimization;Upper bound","","","","0","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through a comparative theoretical study, this paper analyzes several organizational security objectives in order to determine the network intrusion detection system that effectively meets these objectives.

In this correspondence, we propose an intrusion detection algorithm based on the AdaBoost algorithm. In the algorithm, decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features. Adaptable initial weights and a simple strategy for avoiding overfitting are adopted to improve the performance of the algorithm.

The complexity, accessibility, and openness of the Internet have served to increase the security risk of information systems tremendously. Intrusions pose a serious security risk in a network environment. The normal and the abnormal behaviors in networked computers are hard to predict, as the boundaries cannot be well defined. This prediction process usually generates false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced, where a set of fuzzy rules is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and a fuzzy inference engine can be applied over such rules to determine intrusions. This paper proposes a technique with genetic algorithm to generate fuzzy rules instead of manual design that are able to detect anomalies and some specific intrusions. Experiments were performed with DARPA data sets, during normal behavior and intrusive behavior. This paper presents some results and reports the performance of generated fuzzy rules in classifying different types of intrusions.","","978-1-4244-8622-9","","10.1109/ITAIC.2011.6030165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030165","fuzzy classification;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Biological cells;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Training","Internet;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;security of data","DARPA data sets;Internet;anomaly based intrusion detection system;computer network;evolving fuzzy classifiers;false alarm rate;fuzzy inference engine;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithm;information security;information system;intrusive activity;intrusive behavior;network environment;prediction process;security risk","","1","","7","","","20-22 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By arranging several sensors to deal with the traffic in parallel, the intrusion detection system's speed can be significantly increased. How to split the traffic to the sensors is the key problem of a parallel intrusion detection system. To resolve the problems, load balance has to be concerned. There is an emerging need for parallel intrusion detection techniques that can keep up with the increasing network throughput. A novel algorithm of load balance in the parallel IDS (intrusion detection system) was proposed to improve detection ability of parallel IDS. The algorithm was adopted to hash the network packet header information in data packet, to map the corresponding packet to the scope of the sensors' number, and to adjust the scope according to the performance and load of each sensor. Theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can dispatch data packets reasonably and utilize all the sensors' sources effectively.","","978-1-4244-3746-7","","10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731402","hash function;high availability;load balancing;parallel IDS","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Educational technology;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Round robin;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer networks;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data packet;dynamic adaptive load balance algorithm;network packet header information;network throughput;network-based intrusion detection system;parallel intrusion detection system","","0","","9","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once authenticated and associated with the access point, the user can easily move around in the transmission range of the access point without losing data or network connection enjoying bandwidths of the order of multiples of 10 Mega bytes. On the negative side, these wireless LANs tend to have fuzzy boundaries, making it easy for an intruder to capture these transmission signals with a receiving device fitted with a sensitive antenna. An analysis of these captured packets can be good news to the intruder.

Since data are highly sensitive, organizations are reluctant to share them. In many organizations, the security team who can collect such data is not willing to share them even within the organization. The University of Maryland (UMD) plays a significant role in cybersecurity research due to a collaboration between the Office of Information Technologys (OIT) security team and UMD researchers. The result of the collaboration is access to and analysis of all security related data collected on UMD networks. The talk will review some studies conducted using the data provided by OIT. First, organizations face increasing challenges in addressing and preventing computer and network security incidents. Being able to understand and predict trends in incidents can aid an organizations ability to allocate resources for the prevention of such incidents, as well as the evaluation of mitigation strategies. We compared non-homogeneous Poisson process software reliability growth models and time series models with a large set of security incident data. Based on the over 12,000 incidents recorded since 2001, these models were compared for their prediction capability for the number of incidents. Second, security administrators lack network visibility, i.e., they often do not have the tools to monitor their networks in detail. Even though about 40,000 IP addresses are linked to UMD users, the UMD network consists of more than 130,000 IP addresses. We developed a tool called Nfsight that identifies clients, servers, and scanners solely based on network flows. Various heuristics have been applied and combined using a Bayesian method. Nfsight is currently monitoring the UMD network and the security team has integrated Nfsight into their security tool suit- - e. Nfsight has found compromised computers that were undetected by the other security tools used by the security team.","","978-1-4577-0374-4","978-1-4577-0373-7","10.1109/DSNW.2011.5958863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958863","","","","","","0","","","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both signature matching and a variety of feature-based pattern recognition methods have been applied to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must ""port over"" a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain. Finally, we also propose and evaluate a hypothesis testing approach to detect port spoofing by exploiting confusion matrix statistics.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963163","domain adaptation;flow-based classification","Accuracy;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Payloads;Protocols;Servers;Training","cryptography;pattern classification;transport protocols","confusion matrix statistics;data encryption;feature based pattern recognition method;flow classification;offline network planning;online anomaly detection;private-enterprise network;tamper-resistant feature","","4","","29","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work in progress, a Markov based technique is applied to the detection of anomalies in the usage of P2P protocols. The detector searches for two kinds of anomalies: those that appear in the structure, grammar and semantics of each of the messages in the protocol, and those associated to the sequence of messages (protocol sessions). Previous results from other protocols, as HTTP and DNS, confirm the potentialities of the approach.","","978-1-4244-5084-8","978-0-7695-3831-0","10.1109/AP2PS.2009.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5359017","Anomalous behaviour;Intrusion detection;Markov modelling;Network and computer security;P2P networks","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computer hacking;Computer science;Computer security;Electronic mail;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Stochastic processes;Telematics","Markov processes;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;security of data","DNS protocols;HTTP protocols;Markov modelling;P2P networks;P2P protocols;anomaly detection;intrusion detection techniques","","0","","17","","","11-16 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ever evolving new intrusion types pose a serious threat to network security. Although numerous network security tools have been developed, yet the fast growth of intrusive activities is still a serious issue. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to detect intrusive activities on the network. Machine learning and classification algorithms help to design “Intrusion Detection Models” which can classify the network traffic into intrusive or normal traffic. In this paper we present the comparative performance of NSL-KDD based data set compatible classification algorithms. These classifiers have been evaluated in WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) environment using 41 attributes. Around 94,000 instances from complete KDD dataset have been included in the training data set and over 48,000 instances have been included in the testing data set.

While considerable attention has been given to data mining for intrusion detection in wired networks, limited focus has been devoted to data mining for intrusion detection in wireless networks. This study presents a clustering approach with tracers and expert analysis for intrusion detection in a real-world wireless network. Security vulnerabilities of 802.11 wireless networks are investigated, leading to a summary of network traffic metrics relevant to modeling the security of wireless networks. The proposed approach utilizes a simple distance-based heuristic measure to label clusters as either normal or intrusive. The classification of network traffic instances is further enhanced with the aid of tracers, i.e., a small set of instances with known labels - normal or intrusive. Our study demonstrates the usefulness and promise of the proposed approach, laying the groundwork for a clustering-based framework for intrusion detection in wireless computer networks.","","0-7695-2495-8","","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607440","","Communication system security;Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;expert systems;pattern clustering;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","802.11 wireless networks;clustering techniques;data mining;distance-based heuristic measure;expert analysis;intrusion detection;label clusters;network traffic metrics;wireless computer network;wireless network security","","4","","5","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, ""denial of service"" (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach ""cross layer based intrusion detection system""(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance.

We first present the network model and our assumptions, followed by a detailed description of the protocol. Next, a security analysis is provided which shows that the new approach is robust against several location spoofing attacks. Moreover, we derive both analytical and simulation results for the coverage probability and show that a high coverage probability can be achieved with the new protocol, even with a relatively low density of verifier nodes.

In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key management for SAN entities and allow scalable data sharing. We use strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities, thereby removing bottlenecks at disks and causing minimal inconvenience to hosts.

On the other hand, it is also useful to understand the nature of decision rules and association rules mining in network monitor data streams.","","978-1-4244-0971-6","978-1-4244-0971-6","10.1109/ICPCA.2007.4365479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365479","data mining;data streams;granular computing;intrusion detection","Association rules;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Data analysis;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Transaction databases","data mining;multi-agent systems;security of data","association rules mining;decision rules;firewall;granular computing;intrusion detection techniques;multiagent based intelligent intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection system;network monitor data streams;unbounded network monitor data streams","","0","","17","","","26-27 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This KDD CUP 1999 data set was generated by domain expert at MIT Lincon lab. To reduced number of features of this KDD CUP data set, various feature reduction techniques has been already used. These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al. Tesfahun's approach reduces time and complexity of model and improves the detection rate for the minority classes in a considerable amount. This work investigates the effectiveness and the feasibility of Tesfahun et al.'s feature reduction technique on Back Propagation Neural Network classifier. We had performed various experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset and recorded Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Fscore values. In this work, we had done Basic, N-Fold Validation and Testing comparisons on reduced dataset with full feature dataset. Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters. Experiments of N-Fold validation show that classifier that uses reduced dataset, have better generalization capacity. During the testing comparison, we found both the datasets are equally compatible. All the three comparisons clearly show that reduced dataset is better or is equally compatible, and does not have any drawback as compared to full dataset. Our experiments shows that usage of such reduced dataset in BPNN can lead to better model in terms of dataset size, complexity, processing time and generalization ability.","","978-1-4799-8487-9","","10.1109/ACCT.2015.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079087","Back Propagation Neural Network;Feature Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;N Fold Validation","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Power capacitors;Testing;Training","backpropagation;data handling;generalisation (artificial intelligence);neural nets","BPNN;Fscore values;IG;KDD CUP 1999 data set;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;MIT Lincon lab;anomaly detection;back propagation neural network classifier;complexity;computer network;dataset size;domain expert;feature reduction techniques;generalization ability;generalization capacity;information gain;machine learning algorithm;n-fold validation;reduced dataset","","0","","25","","","21-22 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This architecture promotes physical spaces with hundreds of specialized embedded devices that increase productivity, alleviate some specific everyday tasks and provide new ways of interacting with the computational environment. Physical spaces become computer systems, or in other terms, Active Spaces. However, these Active Spaces require novel system software capable of seamlessly coordinating their hidden complexity. Our goal is to extend the RTI model in order to allow interaction with physical spaces and their contained entities (physical and virtual) by means of a single abstraction called Active Space, with this architecture mobile node can also take part in the simulations. When communicating between different mobile agents it is important to encrypt communication information between agents for the security of the network intrusion detection system itself. During the agents on different layer or on the same layers, communication information is easily to be monitored; intercepted and modified because of the exposed position that agent lies in.","","0-7803-9421-6","","10.1109/ICICT.2005.1598612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598612","Active Spaces;GAIA;High Level Architecture;Physical Spaces;Runtime Infrastructure","Authentication;Computer architecture;Embedded computing;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Operating systems;Physics computing;Productivity;Security;System software","","Active Spaces;GAIA;High Level Architecture;Physical Spaces;Runtime Infrastructure","","0","","13","","","27-28 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The agent can be defined as a software entity which functions continuously and autonomously in a particular environment, able to carry out activities in a flexible and intelligent manner that is responsive to changes in the environment, and able to learn from its experience. An intrusion detection system can be decomposed into steps where an agent can perform a single or more step. But performance evaluation techniques of their use are still in the early stage. This infancy status holds especially true for agents used in intrusion detection systems (IDS) since they are new to this field. We believe that the two most important factors to measure for a given IDS are the risk time and the detection time. The risk time is the time at which the computer could be under risk of attack since the intrusion is not discovered yet. The smaller the detection time is the smaller the risk time. Thus, as a step towards a complete evaluation strategy, a simple IDS with agents was tested.","0278-6648","","","10.1109/MP.2005.1462463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1462463","","Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Monitoring;Network servers;Performance evaluation;Risk analysis;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","multi-agent systems;performance evaluation;security of data;software agents","agent-based IDS performance evaluation;artificial intelligence;detection time;intelligent agents;intrusion detection system;risk time;software agents","","1","","13","","","April-May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A novel hypothesis in immunology, the danger theory (DT), is emerging to meet these challenges. DT highlights the importance of the tissue and states that antigen presentation must be coupled with its tissue conditions. In order to create a contextually aware IDS with the incorporation of the concept of tissue, a novel algorithm to grow tissue is presented which adopts the theory of data fields in physics. This algorithm has the ability to dynamically cluster antigen data and provides a useful measure to danger signal. In order to reduce the false positive and increase robustness for detection system, a notion of multi-tissues cooperation to sense dangers in IDS is also demonstrated based on the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4244-2113-8","978-1-4244-2114-5","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593657","Danger Theory;Data Field;Intrusion Detection;Tissue","Artificial immune systems;Clustering algorithms;Computer security;Context awareness;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Signal processing","pattern clustering;security of data","antigen data clustering;antigen presentation;bioinspired multitissues growing algorithm;danger theory;data fields;intrusion detection system","","0","","13","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traffic analysis capability also need to be scaled up correspondingly to handle this high traffic rates. The modern commodity platforms equipped with processors rich in number of cores and having hyper threading technology has enabled emergence of software based solutions rather than dedicated platforms for traffic analysis. But the general purpose network stacks provided by operating systems focus more on compatibility and hence are not able to fully exploit the hardware capabilities of these platforms. Lot of work is reported on customizing the stack for packet capture and achieving line rate (10 Gbps) performance on a single Network Interface Card (NIC). Some work is also reported on use of multiple 10GbE NICs for handling traffic beyond 10 Gbps. This paper brings out through experimental setup and observations the issues involved in linear scaling of performance with additional NICs on commodity Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) servers. It shows that linear scaling requires optimum configurations of compute, memory and network resources especially affinity of NICs to NUMA nodes. Using these configurations we are able to achieve linear scaling of traffic analysis capability with additional 10 GbE NICs. We report scaled performance upto 40 Gbps with the use of four NIC cards.","","978-1-4799-6870-1","","10.1109/ICDSE.2014.6974636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974636","Commodity Servers;Linear Scaling;Multiple NICs;Traffic Capture;beyond 10 Gbps","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Hardware;Program processors;Servers","network interfaces;telecommunication traffic","Internet users;NIC;NUMA nodes;commodity NUMA servers;commodity nonuniform memory access servers;compute resource;general purpose network stacks;hyper threading technology;line rate performance;linear performance scaling;memory resource;multiple network interface cards;network resource;network traffic rate;operating systems;optimum configurations;packet capture;single network interface card;software based solutions;traffic analysis capability;traffic capture","","0","","13","","","26-28 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A promising approach to this problem is to apply linear data transformation and anomaly detection techniques on top of known attack signatures that convey contextual properties. The linear data transformation technique relies on several discriminant functions, which are used to calculate the estimated probability of zero-day attacks by analyzing network connection features. The anomaly detection technique identifies zero-day attacks using the One Class Nearest Neighbor (1-class NN) algorithm, which has been applied using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to achieve dimensionality reduction. An experimental prototype has been implemented to evaluate these techniques using data from the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset. The results indicate that linear data transformation techniques are quite effective and efficient in detecting zero-day attacks.","","978-1-4799-0406-8","","10.1109/SERE.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6571706","Intrusion detection;contextual information;misuse detection;one class nearest neighbor;zero-day attack","Context;Covariance matrices;Entropy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Probability;Training","pattern classification;probability;security of data;singular value decomposition","1-class NN algorithm;IDS;NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset;SVD technique;anomaly detection technique;attack probability;attack signature;dimensionality reduction;discriminant function;intrusion detection system;linear data transformation technique;network connection feature;one class nearest neighbor;singular value decomposition;zero-day attack identification","","0","","37","","","18-20 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both NSAs and PSAs comprise of two phases: generating a set D of detectors from a given set S of selves (detector generation phase); and then detecting if a given cell (new data instance) is self or non-self using the generated detector set (detection phase). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combining NSAs and PSAs that employ binary representation and r-chunk matching rule.

Experimental results show that even for a simple 3-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by a Markov model. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50- node) ad hoc networks indicate that a monitoring based intrusion detection has very high false positives which impact its ability to mitigate the attacks.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698177","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise level;Power system security;Testing;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;noise generators","Markov model;data forwarding;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;probabilistic noise generator","","1","","11","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And the NSPIM adopts DMTF's CIM to represent a relationship between policies and policy enforcement systems. In addition, a flexible policy representation is possible because the NSPIM can offer both a domain-level packet filtering mechanism and a device-level packet filtering mechanism","","","","10.1109/ICACT.2005.245965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1461972","","Access protocols;Computer integrated manufacturing;Diffserv networks;Filtering;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Resource management;Specification languages","telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","network security policy information model;packet filtering mechanism;policy representation;policy-based network management","","1","","8","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two types of immunity-based agents: one is detection agent and the other is counterattack agent. Detection agents take charge of monitoring the nodes in the network, detecting the anomaly activities, and taking response to the invader, which may be viewed as T-cell lymphocyte. Counterattack agent as antibody, is built in each regular node which is regarded as B-cell. When Detection agents find invaders, they send out instructions to activate the counterattack agents in the neighbor nodes of the invaders. These Counterattack agents will surround the invaders and finally kill them. Lastly, the paper discusses how the security architecture works and protects the MANET from violating infliction by bringing forward an example.","","978-1-4244-5136-4","978-1-4244-5137-1","10.1109/ICWCSC.2010.5415918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5415918","Agent;Immune system;Mobile Ad Hoc network;network Security","Artificial immune systems;Cities and towns;Communication system security;Databases;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;multi-agent systems;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET;T-cell lymphocyte;artificial immune system;counterattack agent;detection agents;immune agents;immunity-based agents;mobile ad hoc networks;multiagents;security architecture","","0","","8","","","2-4 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most computer systems have some kind of a security flaw that may allow outsiders or legitimate users to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Among the network exploits, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a large-scale, coordinated attack on the availability of services of a victim system, launched indirectly through many compromised computers on the Internet. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are network security tools that process local audit data or monitor network traffic to search for specific patterns or certain deviations from expected behavior which indicate malicious activities against the protected network. In our study, we proposed and tested four different distributed intrusion detection methods to detect DDoS attacks in the MIT DARPA LLDOS 1.0 dataset. Currently, all of our methods use the alarms generated by Snort, a signature-based network IDS. We used mobile agents in three of the methods on the Jade (Java Agent Development Framework) platform in order to reduce network bandwidth usage by moving data analysis computations to the location of the intrusion data. Based on reliability, network load and mean detection time values of each, one of the methods is shown to be better than the others.","","978-1-4244-2880-9","978-1-4244-2881-6","10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4717920","DARPA Dataset;DDoS;Distributed Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Detection;Jade: Java Agent Development Framework;Mobile Agents","Application software;Computer applications;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile agents","Internet;Java;authorisation;data analysis;mobile agents;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attacks;Internet;Jade;Java agent development framework platform;MIT DARPA LLDOS 1.0 dataset;Snort;computer systems;data analysis computations;distributed denial of service attack;distributed intrusion detection;information systems;intrusion data;intrusion detection systems;local audit data;mean detection;mobile agents;network bandwidth usage;network load;network security tools;network traffic monitoring;security flaw;signature-based network IDS;unauthorized access","","3","","21","","","27-29 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Suffix matching algorithms have good time efficiency, and thus are widely used. These algorithms require that all patterns in a set have the same length. When the patterns cannot satisfy this requirement, the leftmost characters, m being the length of the shortest pattern, are extracted to construct the data structure. We call such m-character strings partial strings. However, a simple extraction from the left does not address the impact of partial string locations on search speed. We propose a novel method to extract the partial strings from each pattern which maximizes search speed. More specifically, with this method we can compute all the corresponding searching time cost by theoretical derivation, and choose the location which yields an approximately minimal search time. We evaluate our method on two rule sets: Snort and ClamAV. Experiments show that in most cases, our method achieves the fastest searching speed in all possible locations of partial string extraction, and is about 5%-20% faster than the alternative methods.","","978-1-4577-0249-5","978-1-4577-0248-8","10.1109/INFCOMW.2011.5928778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928778","SBOM algorithm;Wu Manber algorithm;multiple string matching;pattern matching;string matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bills of materials;Data mining;Data structures;Pattern matching;Training","Internet;feature extraction;string matching","ClamAV;Internet;Snort;Web content monitoring system;optimal partial string extraction;pattern matching;searching time cost;string matching;suffix matching algorithm","","1","","11","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the interdependency between event-based and state-based evidence, this paper develops techniques to automatically integrate complementary evidence into Bayesian networks, and reason about uncertain or unknown intrusion evidence based on verified evidence.

However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection. In this paper, we propose the use of sequential sampling technique to achieve optimum detection by trading off adequately between detection delay and accuracy in the CA process. We illustrate our approach through CA based on user command line sequence and naïve Bayes classification scheme.

However, due to operational mistakes, malicious intent of insiders or vulnerabilities exploited by outsiders, data stored in a database can still be compromised. When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.","1063-9527","0-7695-2716-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189","","Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases","","","","4","","24","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.","1542-1201","978-1-4673-0267-8","978-1-4673-0268-5","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices","","0","","19","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization, which outperforms other optimization algorithm considerably on its simple architecture and fast convergence, has previously applied to solve optimum problem. However, the QPSO also has its own shortcomings. So, a hybrid algorithm in training RBF neural network was proposed. This new evolutionary algorithm, which is based on a hybrid of quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) and gradient descent algorithm (GD), is employed to train RBFNN. Experimental result on KDD99 intrusion detection datasets shows that this RBFNN using the novel hybrid algorithm has high detection rate while maintaining a low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-1685-1","978-1-4244-1686-8","10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4525415","","Clustering algorithms;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Radial basis function networks","computer networks;evolutionary computation;gradient methods;particle swarm optimisation;radial basis function networks;security of data;telecommunication security","RBF neural network;evolutionary algorithm;gradient descent algorithm;hybrid QPSO;intrusion detection;network anomaly detection;quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization;radial basis function neural network","","2","","14","","","6-8 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different methods and algorithms are developed and proposed in recent years to improve intrusion detection systems. The most important issue in current systems is that they are poor at detecting novel anomaly attacks. These kinds of attacks refer to any action that significantly deviates from the normal behaviour which is considered intrusion. This paper proposed a model to improve this problem based on data mining techniques. Apriori algorithm is used to predict novel attacks and generate real-time rules for firewall. Apriori algorithm extracts interesting correlation relationships among large set of data items. This paper illustrates how to use Apriori algorithm in intrusion detection systems to cerate a automatic firewall rules generator to detect novel anomaly attack. Apriori is the best-known algorithm to mine association rules. This is an innovative way to find association rules on large scale.","2154-7491","978-1-4244-6539-2","","10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5579365","Anomaly detection;Apriori algorithm;Association rules;Data mining;Intrusion;Intrusion detection systems","","authorisation;data mining","Apriori algorithm;anomaly attacks;anomaly detection systems;computer systems security infrastructures;data mining techniques;firewall rules generator;network intrusion detection systems","","1","","16","","","20-22 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is noted that neither the single certificate authority (CA) nor the distributed CA can meet the security requirements for this type of network. In this study, the authors propose an adaptive distributed certificate management scheme in which the nodes that provide certificate services are selected dynamically in the network. The security risks caused by the static nodes are avoided in the proposed scheme. The status of the nodes in the network is completely equal and the credit values that vary with the operation of the network are the only criterion to measure their responsibilities. The scheme can effectively prevent attackers from getting permission of the certificate services and could be applicable to the complex and dynamic networks.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684471","","","","","","0","","","","","December 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

What are necessary and prudent efforts when a customer calls with a major security problem that needs to be fixed with a proven, off-the-approval-list, multi-layered integrated system with high visibility and limited funding and expires at the end of the Fiscal Year? Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree, many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based on a rapid management ""guestimate."" Then a Project Manager (PM) is assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope, compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven systems via an ""Extreme Project"" is sometimes necessary. Extreme Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a highly-tailored and agile project management process with management support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the customer. This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the valuable analysis and project management techniques. Indeed, having worked on a well-planned project provides the basis for experienced team members to complete Extreme Projects. This paper does, however, provide insight into what it takes for projects t- - o be successfully implemented and accepted when completed under extreme conditions.","1071-6572","978-1-4244-7403-5","","10.1109/CCST.2010.5678718","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678718","Extreme Project;Project Management;agile project;resources;security system implementation","Documentation;Lead;Personnel;Procurement;Project management;Schedules;Security","decision trees;project management;security of data;software management;software prototyping","decision trees;multilayered integrated system;project management;risk management;security system;software code","","0","","6","","","5-8 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Access control mechanisms can sometimes fail to provide complete security to these pervasive computing devices as witnessed in infrastructure based networks. The addition of pervasive computing devices to infrastructure based networks makes the problem of intrusion detection even harder.

Functionality of Buildings Energy Management Systems (BEMS) need re-evaluation in the context of smart grid environment. In particular, their inability for real time feedback and a rather static mode of operations requires attention in the light of smart grid operations. By using a multi agent system in combination with traditional BEMS, a layered process control system at building level that conceptualises energy demand interactively with the smart grid supply infrastructure and the environment is possible. Practical contribution is improved energy management by balancing energy demand and energy supply. The paper discusses optimisation of BEMS operations for energy efficiency and indoor human comfort using multi-agents system (MAS) technology in the Smart Grid environment.
