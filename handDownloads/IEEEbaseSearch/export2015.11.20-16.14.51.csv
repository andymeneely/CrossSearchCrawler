First International IEEE","20030228","2002","","","80","93","Storage Area Networks, with their ability to offer high data availability, reliability and scalability, are a promising solution for the large scale storage needs of many enterprises. As with any distributed storage system, a major design challenge for a Storage Area Network (SAN) is to provide data integrity and confidentiality. In this paper we propose a solution which addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key distribution to allow scalable data sharing. Our scheme uses strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities (e.g., switches, routers or other network elements), thereby removing bottlenecks at the disks and causing minimal inconvenience to the hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose efficient group key mechanisms that do not involve any centralized key distribution servers. This allows our scheme to be scalable and be free from any single point of failure or attack.","","0-7695-1888-5","","10.1109/SISW.2002.1183514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183514","","Availability;Cities and towns;Cryptography;Data security;Network servers;Power system security;Scalability;Secure storage;Storage area networks;Web server","cryptography;data integrity;data privacy;distributed databases;network operating systems","SAN entities;cryptographic processing;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;distributed storage system;group key agreement;group key mechanisms;reliability;scalability;scalable data sharing;storage area networks;strong cryptographic techniques","","3","1","30","","","11 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In Gray hole and Black hole attacks malicious nodes deliberately disrupt data transmission in the network by sending incorrect routing information. It is a challenge to keep the communication route free from such attackers. In this paper, we propose a scheme for Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol, in which an intermediate node detects the malicious node sending false routing information, routing packets are used not only to pass routing information, but also to pass information about malicious nodes. The proposed scheme not only detects but also removes malicious node by isolating it, to make safe and secure communication.","","978-1-4673-0471-9","","10.1109/ACCT.2012.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6168308","AODV;Blackhole Attack;Grayhole Attack;MANETs;Security","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","AODV protocol;DoS attacks;MANET;ad-hoc on-demand distance vector protocol;blackhole attacks;data transmission;dynamic topology;false routing information;grayhole attacks;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;routing packets;safe communication;secure communication;wireless communication","","6","","16","","","7-8 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, with the ever evolving nature of business, and the associated technology for supporting it, requirements for security are also evolving. Computers cannot protect information automatically. To guard information residing on the computers, security services and related technologies need to be applied. Security breaches are constantly changing, often at a speed that is difficult to measure. So security practices and procedures need to be reviewed, tested and upgraded on a constant basis, staying ahead of the game. One way of ensuring better security is to be able to measure its strength, and take steps to improve it in a continuous manner. Several standards are being developed that aim to certify the strength of a security system. However, these standards focus on qualitative evaluation of security level of a system and do not consider either the dynamic aspects of user behavior or the possible vulnerabilities and threats the system may be subjected to. Consequently, there is a need for an alternative quantitative modeling approach for security assessment that overcomes the above mentioned drawbacks of the existing systems. In this paper, we present an extensible framework called iMeasure Security (iMS) that is aimed at quantifying the security strength of an enterprise system and its business impact.","","978-1-4244-5364-1","978-0-7695-3924-9","10.1109/NetCoM.2009.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383971","Attack graph;Business impact;Likelihood estimation;Security quantification","Business communication;Communication system security;Computer networks;Computer security;Information security;Network servers;Protection;Standards development;Testing;Velocity measurement","commerce;computer network security","computer network;enterprise system;iMeasure security;network server;qualitative evaluation;quantitative modeling;security assessment;security quantification;security system","","0","","22","","","27-29 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key idea is to use ANN models to discover distinct patterns that describe an intrusion activity and use these patterns to train the ANN model which will then recognize intrusions and other abnormalities. We present a border intrusion detection system in which light and sound data from low-cost sensor motes spread out on the field is used to help ANNs make automated decisions and report intrusion activity.

The crossover operator based on generated subnet is adopted considering the relationship between genotype and phenotype. An adaptive mutation rate is applied, and the mutation type is selected heuristically from weight adaptation, node deletion and node addition. When the population is not evolved continuously for many generations, in order to jump from the local optima and extend the search space, the mutation rate will be increased and the mutation type will be changed.

By exploiting such vulnerabilities, we propose attack methods for revealing a victim program's data kept in GPU memory both during its execution and right after its termination. We further show the high applicability of the proposed attacks by applying them to the Chromium and Firefox web browsers which use GPUs for accelerating webpage rendering. We detect that both browsers leave rendered webpage textures in GPU memory, so that we can infer which web pages a victim user has visited by analyzing the remaining textures.

Especially in the mobile area there are many security issues that have not yet been satisfactorily addressed, let alone been solved. Most of the security mechanisms and techniques used in wired networks tend to rely upon a fixed network topology. For example, firewalls and intrusion detection systems are placed at central points of a network and configured with a model of the network's structure to control and analyse the data flows transferred for harmful content. If at all, adopting these measures for the mobile world is not easy due to its dynamically changing environments and the mobile device's resource constraints that do not allow demanding analyse tasks. In this paper, we present our work in progress of developing a system architecture for cooperative and self-protecting mobile devices. Our approach is based on the assumption that a mobile network can be protected by securing all participating devices or at least all honest participating devices. Thus, we no longer insist on a global view of the network but on several local views. To make these views as precise as possible and to avoid serious performance bottlenecks on a single device we propose a strategy for coupling trusted mobile devices together into a cooperating group","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198802","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Network topology;Protection;Virtual private networks","mobile computing;mobile handsets;security of data;telecommunication network topology","cooperative self-protecting mobile devices;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;mobile network;network topology;security issues;trustful relationships","","0","","39","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system consists of several sets of a camera and a PC (personal computer) connected via network. Prior to the monitoring, a system manager will set up several sensitive planes in the world using a GUI (graphical user interface). To detect the intruding objects, images taken by the cameras are compared with a maintained background image using PISC (peripheral increment sign correlation) method. Then the contour of the object region on a image is traced and transformed to the coordinate of sensitive plane. If the intruding object exceeds the sensitive plane, the contours from each PC would have some common regions. This system does not reconstruct the shape of the object, but the system is able to handle 3D (three-dimensional) protection volumes because multiple sensitive planes can be set arbitrary. This system does not require us to calibrate the camera because this system is based on 2D (two-dimensional) homography.","","0-7803-7987-X","","10.1109/MFI-2003.2003.1232673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232673","","Cameras;Computerized monitoring;Face detection;Graphical user interfaces;Humans;Image reconstruction;Intrusion detection;Object detection;Robustness;Shape","computer vision;graphical user interfaces;image recognition;image sensors;monitoring;object detection;safety systems","2D homography;3D protection volume;GUI;PC network;PISC method;camera calibration;contour-based multiplanar visual hull;graphical user interface;intrusion detection;multiple sensitive plane;object shape reconstruction;peripheral increment sign correlation;two-dimensional","","0","","3","","","30 July-1 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Harnessing the Power of P2P Systems for Fast Attack Signature Validation","Antonatos, S.; Vu Quang Hieu","Inst. of Comput. Sci., Found. for Res. & Technol. Hellas, Heraklion, Greece","Network and System Security, 2009. NSS '09. Third International Conference on","20091110","2009","","","107","114","Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions.","2157-2305","978-1-4673-1788-7","","10.1109/SEAMS.2012.6224403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224403","Adaptive security;Adaptive software;Assets;Smart grid","Buildings;Cameras;Energy management;Home appliances;Monitoring;Security;Smart grids","asset management;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","asset variability;customer domain;engineering adaptive security requirement;monitoring function;primary assets;secondary assets;security control;security countermeasures;smart grid;valuable asset management","","2","","8","","","4-5 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents attack diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking. AD's architecture is inline with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm, in which attack detection is performed near the victim host and attack mitigation is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense that is activated by a victim host after an attack has been detected. A victim activates AD by sending AD-related commands to its upstream routers. On receipt of such commands, the AD-enabled upstream routers deterministically mark each packet destined for the victim with the information of the input interface that processed that packet. By collecting the router interface information recorded in the packet markings, the victim can trace back the attack traffic to the attack sources. Once the traceback is complete, the victim issues messages that command AD-enabled routers to filter attack packets close to the source. The AD commands can be authenticated by the TTL field of the IP header without relying on any global key distribution infrastructure in Internet. Although AD can effectively filter traffic generated by a moderate number of attack sources, it is not effective against large-scale attacks. To address this problem, we propose an extension to AD called parallel attack diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attack sources simultaneously. AD and PAD are analyzed and evaluated using a realistic network topology based on the Skitter Internet map. Both schemes are shown to be robust against IP spoofing and incur low false positive ratios.","1095-2055","0-7803-9428-3","","10.1109/ICCCN.2005.1523866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1523866","","Atherosclerosis;Computer crime;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","DDoS attack;IP header;Internet protocol;PAD;Skitter Internet map;TTL field;attack diagnosis;attack mitigation scheme;counter-measure paradigm;distributed denial-of-service;global key distribution infrastructure;packet marking;parallel attack diagnosis;pushback marking;realistic network topology;transistor-transistor logic","","3","","17","","","17-19 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common solution is to close the performance gap through hardware implementation of security functions. However, continuously expanding signature databases have become a major impediment to achieving scalable hardware based pattern matching. Additionally, evolutionary rule databases have necessitated real time online updating for reconfigurable hardware implementations. Based on the observation that signature patterns are constructed from combinations of a limited number of primary patterns, we propose to decompose the Snort signature patterns. These smaller primary pattern sets can be stored along with their associations to allow dynamic signature pattern reconstruction. Not only does the matching operation potentially become more scalable, but the real time online updating task is simplified. The approach is verified with patterns from the latest version of the Snort rule database. The experimental results show that after decomposition, a reduction in size of over 77% can be achieved on Snort signature patterns.","","978-1-4244-5047-3","978-1-4244-5048-0","10.1109/DRCN.2009.5339986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339986","Decompose;FPGAs;Finite State Machine;Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS);Scalability;Security","Decision support systems;Hardware;Virtual reality","digital signatures;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;reconfigurable architectures","FPGA;Snort rule database;Snort signature pattern;dynamic signature pattern reconstruction;evolutionary rule database;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching;reconfigurable hardware;security software;signature database","","3","","18","","","25-28 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Outsourcing the data to a cloud in a multitenant environment brings many security challenges including data leaks, threats, and malicious attacks. The cloud computing platform, virtual servers, and the provider's services are highly dynamic and diverse in nature, making the traditional access control mechanisms (e.g., Firewalls and VLAN etc.) less effective in controlling the unauthorized access to cloud's data and resources. Several access control policies and authorization system have been proposed in literature to defend against cloud security threats. Most of these systems are designed to work with one or more access control policies. However, little work has been done to develop generic access control architecture capable to work with most of the available access control policies. In this paper, we present a new access control architecture using a global resource management system (GRMS) to effectively handle both local and remote access requests. The introduction of GRMS makes our proposed architecture semi distributed at the expense of minimal request-response time. In addition, our proposed architecture works effectively with both peered access control module (PACM) and virtual resource manager (VRM) to protect and manage all resources and services of cloud providers from unauthorized access.","","978-1-4673-7286-2","","10.1109/CLOUD.2015.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214083","Access control;cloud computing;role based access control;side channel attack;virtual resource manager","Authorization;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Containers;Virtualization","authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;file servers;resource allocation","GRMS;PACM;VRM;access control mechanisms;authorization system;cloud computing;cloud environment security;cloud providers;cloud security threats;data leaks;generic access control architecture;global resource management system;malicious attacks;multitenant environment;peered access control module;privacy concerns;security challenges;security concerns;semidistributed access control management scheme;unauthorized access;virtual resource manager;virtual servers","","0","","17","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, by taking self-securing approach, the proposed protocol makes use of a localized trust model which allows users to get certificates and to perform authentication without requirement of any on-line trusted third party. Compared to other securing routing protocols, our solution eliminates the unrealistic assumption about the availability of on-line trusted authorities or certificate repositories, thus, it can take advantage of public-key technology to prevent many types of attack from malicious nodes.

Then, the use of the FPGA leads to increase in power consumption. In this work, by using 180 nm C-MOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) technology, waved-shift registers necessary for the multiplexed bus are developed. Furthermore, the comparative evaluations of the waved-shift registers are executed by using the conventional shift register that operates at 2GHz.

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","978-0-7695-4159-4","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","3","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ADBHC generates clusters using density-based partitioning method which has less computational cost. It uses the improved hierarchical clustering tree to implement fast scalable and adaptive anomaly detection. The improved hierarchical clustering tree supports updating profiles at any time. We extend the clustering algorithm and apply branch and bound mechanism for filtering noise. With the help of two advantages: filtering noise and updating profiles at any time, our algorithm is effective enough to meet adaptive requirements.

Modern examples include address-lookup in network routers for a forwarding outgoing link, rule-matching in intrusion detection systems comparing incoming packets with a large database, etc. Hashing algorithms involve transforming a key inside each target data to a hash value hoping that the hashing would render the database a uniform distribution with respect to this new hash value. When the database are already key-wise uniformly distributed, any regular hashing algorithm would easily lead to perfectly uniform distribution after the hashing. On the other hand, if records in the database are instead not uniformly distributed, then different hashing functions would lead to different performance. This paper addresses the case when such distribution follows a natural negative linear distribution, which is found to approximate distributions in many various applications. For this distribution, we derive a general formula for calculating the distribution variance produced by any given non-overlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing function. Such a distribution variance from the hashing directly translates to performance variations in searching. In this paper, the best XOR hashing function is determined for any given key size and any given hashing target size.","","978-1-59593-082-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675280","address lookup;computer networks;hashing;internet;intrusion detection;network security;packet matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed databases;IP networks;Information retrieval;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Permission;Secure storage","computer networks;file organisation;information retrieval;statistical distributions","computer network;large database search;linearly distributed address lookup;natural negative linear distribution;nonoverlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing algorithm;uniform distribution","","2","","10","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Stealthy superpoint is a host that its cardinality is between two thresholds during a measurement period. Detecting stealthy superpoints helps intrusion systems identify potential attackers. However, stealthy superpoints may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate, and they can easily evade the detection. The existing algorithm can not directly be used to detect them. This paper proposes an algorithm based on Bitmap which can detect stealthy superpoints. The algorithm includes online module and offline module. The online module consists of two submodules. One uses a bloom filter to filter the duplicate packets and store the source addresses. The other uses two-dimensional bit arrays to process packets. The offline estimates the cardinality. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our algorithm can precisely detect stealthy superpoints and estimate their cardinalities.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945711","Bitmap;Stealthy superpoints;host cardinality","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Estimation;Indexes;Internet","Internet;computer crime;computer network security;peer-to-peer computing","Bloom filter;Internet host;attackers identification;bitmap-based algorithm;duplicate packets;host cardinality;intrusion systems;offline module;online module;peers;process packets;source addresses;stealthy superpoint detection;two-dimensional bit arrays","","0","","14","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BIND9 DNS server and its DNS update utilities are enhanced to support new DNS entries with indirect routing information. Protocol software for supporting the establishment of indirect routes based on the new DNS entries is developed for Linux systems.

In this paper we advocate the use of a hybrid approach, in which each type of cache acts as a module in a system with shared memory and storage space. A static scheduler precedes the cache modules and determines what types of traffic should be forwarded to which module. We also propose several optimizations for each of the modules, such that the storage and memory overhead are minimized. We evaluate the proposed system by performing a trace driven emulation. Our results indicate that a hybrid system is able to provide better savings than a proxy cache, or a standalone RE system.

In this way we introduce high level of generality and thus achieve high detection rates, but also gain high reduction of the system training time.

We demonstrate how a security layer can be added within the network communication controller in modern time-triggered systems, without introducing additional latency or processing overheads. This allows critical communications to be secured in a manner that is transparent to the processors in the electronic control units (ECUs), while also safeguarding network communication properties.","","978-1-4799-6244-0","","10.1109/FPT.2014.7082788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7082788","","Automotive engineering;Encryption;Field programmable gate arrays;Protocols;Synchronization;Vehicles","automotive electronics;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays","FPGAs;electronic control units;network communication controller;time-triggered automotive networks;zero latency encryption","","1","","22","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The large number of potential rendezvous points makes it difficult for law enforcement to effectively shut down botnets. In this paper we present our methodology for detecting algorithmically generated domain flux. Our detection method is based on DNS query failures resulting from domain flux technique. We process the network traffic, particularly DNS traffic. We analyze all DNS query failures and propose a threshold for DNS query failures from the same IP address. We applied our methodology on packet capture (pcap) file which contains real and long-lived malware traffic and we proved that our methodology can successfully detect domain flux technique and identify the infected host.

Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods.

We show that if the connectivity of the network is sufficiently high, the IDS only needs to observe a subset of the nodes in the network in order to achieve this objective. Our approach provides a characterization of the set of nodes that should be observed, a systematic procedure for the IDS to use to identify the malicious nodes and recover the outputs of the plant, and an upper bound on the delay required to obtain the necessary information.","0743-1546","978-1-4244-7745-6","","10.1109/CDC.2010.5717166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5717166","","Joining processes;Linear systems;Monitoring;Network topology;Sensors;Transfer functions;Wireless communication","radio networks;security of data;telecommunication control;telecommunication security","IDS;intrusion detection system;malicious behavior;resource constrained wireless node;wireless control network","","13","","19","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, many of them are intentionally designed to burden or destroy the capabilities of their peers and the supporting network infrastructure. Hence, considerable effort has been focused on detecting and predicting the breaches in security propagated by these malicious applications. However, the enormity of the Internet poses a formidable challenge to representing and analyzing such attacks on it using scalable models. Furthermore, the unavailability of complete information on network vulnerabilities makes the task of forecasting the systems that are likely to be exploited by such applications in the future even harder. This paper presents a technique to identify attacks on large networks using a highly scalable model, while filtering for false positives and negatives. It also forecasts the propagation of the security failures proliferated by attacks over time and their likely targets in the future.","","1-4244-1029-0","1-4244-1029-0","10.1109/SECON.2007.342984","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147514","","Application software;Computer science;Computer worms;Explosions;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Predictive models;Visualization","Internet;graph theory;telecommunication security","Internet;malicious applications;network attack identification;network infrastructure;network vulnerabilities;path prediction;security failure propagation","","3","","14","","","22-25 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces a new host-based anomaly intrusion detection methodology using discontiguous system call patterns, in an attempt to increase detection rates whilst reducing false alarm rates. The key concept is to apply a semantic structure to kernel level system calls in order to reflect intrinsic activities hidden in high-level programming languages, which can help understand program anomaly behaviour. Excellent results were demonstrated using a variety of decision engines, evaluating the KDD98 and UNM data sets, and a new, modern data set. The ADFA Linux data set was created as part of this research using a modern operating system and contemporary hacking methods, and is now publicly available. Furthermore, the new semantic method possesses an inherent resilience to mimicry attacks, and demonstrated a high level of portability between different operating system versions.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2013.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6419701","ADFA-LD;Intrusion detection;anomaly detection;computer security;host-based IDS;system calls","Clocks;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Cryptography;Gaussian processes;Logic gates;Registers","high level languages;operating systems (computers);security of data","KDD98 data sets;UNM data sets;contemporary hacking methods;contiguous system call patterns;discontiguous system call patterns;false alarm rates;high-level programming languages;host-based anomaly intrusion detection system design;modern operating system;program anomaly behaviour;semantic structure","","8","","67","","2013-01-24","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We formulate the problem of distributed collaborative defense against coordinated attacks in MANET as a dynamic game problem. In our formulation we have on the one hand a group of attackers that observe what is going on in the network and coordinate their attack in an adaptive manner. On the other side, we have a group of defending nodes (the IDS nodes) that collaboratively observe the network and coordinate their actions against the attackers. Using extensions of the game theoretic framework of [3] we provide a mathematical framework for efficient identification of the worst attacks and damages that the attackers can achieve, as well as the best response of the defenders. This approach leads to quantifying resiliency of the routing-attack IDS with respect to Byzantine attacks.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455008","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455008","","Collaboration;Communication system traffic control;Delay;Educational institutions;Game theory;Inductors;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols","","","","6","","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these techniques need a large number of self elements to build the profile and lack adaptability. Aiming at the problems of traditional techniques, an immunity-based dynamic method for network anomaly detection, referred to as WAD, is proposed in this paper. WAD builds an appropriate profile using only a subset of normal elements and adapts the varieties of self and non-self space, which adjust adaptively the self radius, the detection radius, and numbers of detectors to amend the built profile. The experiment results show that WAD is an efficient solution to anomaly detection, and has the features of high detection rate, low false alarm rate, self-learning, and adaptation.","","978-1-4244-1747-6","978-1-4244-1748-3","10.1109/ICBBE.2008.157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4535037","","Biology;Computational Intelligence Society;Computer science;Computer security;Computer vision;Detectors;Immune system;Space technology;Sun;Training data","computer networks;security of data","WAD method;immunity based dynamic anomaly detection;network anomaly detection;self elements","","1","","17","","","16-18 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new IDS alert correlation method to detect attack scenarios in real-time. The proposed method is based on causal approach due to the strength of causal methods in practice. Most of causal methods can be deployed offline but not in real-time due to time and memory limitations. In the proposed method the knowledge base of attack patterns is represented in a graph model called Causal Relations Graph. In offline, we construct some trees related to alerts probable correlations. In real-time for each received alert, we can find its correlations with previously received alerts by performing a search only in the corresponding tree. Thus processing time of each alert decreases significantly. In addition, the proposed method is immune to the deliberately slowed attacks. To verify the proposed method, it was implemented in C++ and we used DARPA2000 dataset to test it. Experimental results show the correctness of the proposed alert correlation and its efficiency with respect to the run time.","","978-1-4673-2387-1","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408197","Alert;Alert Correlation;Attack;Attack Scenario;Graph;Intrusion;Intrusion Detection System","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Memory management;Real-time systems;Security","C++ language;computer network security;knowledge based systems;real-time systems;trees (mathematics)","C++ implementation;DARPA 2000 dataset;IDS alert correlation method;attack patterns;causal approach;causal methods;causal relations graph;graph model;intrusion detection alert correlation;intrusion detection systems;knowledge base representation;real-time attack scenario detection;trees","","1","","20","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary signaling protocol in these multimedia services is Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This protocol, however, is vulnerable against attacks, which may reduce the Quality of Service (QoS), an important feature in NGN services. One of the most frequent attacks is Denial of Service (DoS), which can easily be generated but its detection is not trivial. In this paper, a framework is proposed to detect Denial of Service attacks and other forms of intrusions, then generate responses accordingly. Our proposed detection engine combines the specification- and anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed approach can successfully be employed to detect intruders and limit their access. Detection rates and false alarms are reported based on prepared labeled dataset from the actual test-bed.","","978-1-4244-9153-7","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764552","Denial of Service;Flooding Attacks;Intrusion detection system;Session Initiation Protocol;State Machine","Engines;Floods;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Registers;Servers","IPTV;Internet telephony;multimedia communication;next generation networks;quality of service;security of data;signalling protocols","IPTV;QoS;SIP intrusion detection;VoIP;denial of service attacks;multimedia services;next generation networks;quality of service;response systems;session initiation protocol;signaling protocol","","5","","13","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first question deals with how the packet loss rate affects the sensor alert rate, and the second considers how the network traffic composition affects the results of the first question. Potential places where packet loss may occur are examined by dividing the problem into network, host, and sensor based packets loss. We posit theories about how packet loss may present itself and develop the Packet Dropper that induces packet loss into a dataset. Drop rates ranging from 0% to 100% are applied to four different data sets and the resulting abridged data sets are analyzed with Snort to collect alert loss rate. Conclusions are drawn about the importance of the distribution of packet loss and the effect of the network traffic composition.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888699","Network Intrusion Detection Packet Loss","Intrusion detection;Kernel;Packet loss;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Packet Dropper;Snort;alert loss rate;network intrusion detection;network traffic composition;packet loss distribution;packet loss rate;sensor alert rate","","0","","16","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present the architecture of VisFlowConnect-IP, a powerful new tool to visualize IP network traffic flow dynamics for security situational awareness. VisFlowConnect-IP allows an operator to visually assess the connectivity of large and complex networks on a single screen. It provides an overall view of the entire network and filter/drill-down features that allow operators to request more detailed information. Preliminary reports from several organizations using this tool report increased responsiveness to security events as well as new insights into understanding the security dynamics of their networks. In this paper we focus specifically on the design decisions made during the VisFlowConnect development process so that others may learn from our experience. The current VisFlowConnect architecture - the result of these design decisions - is extensible to processing other high-volume multi-dimensional data streams where link connectivity/activity is a focus of study. We report experimental results quantifying the scalability of the underlying algorithms for representing link analysis given continuous high-volume traffic flows as input.","","0-7695-2317-X","","10.1109/IWIA.2005.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410709","NetFlow;link analysis;security situational awareness;security visualization","Complex networks;Data security;Data visualization;Delay;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;data communication;inter-computer links;security of data;telecommunication links;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IP security situational awareness;IP-based traffic dynamics visualization;Netflow;VisFlowConnect-IP architecture;computer networks;high-volume multidimensional data stream processing;link activity;link analysis system;link connectivity;network connectivity;network security dynamics;security events;temporal relationships","","4","","30","","","23-24 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks can inflict harmful threats to various nodes (SIP proxy servers, User agents, etc) and may cause failure to the SIP system. This is one reason why over 40 proposals, addressing these problems, have been published. Regrettably, not many of these researchers have considered scalability, extensibility and other performance issues by testing their promising prevention techniques in a real network. We find that there are around eight practical frameworks and the aim of this paper is to revisit these countermeasures solutions. We propose a new way of evaluation criteria and a comparative study of the researchers' ideas are being addressed based on the models (if any) used, the network architectures and the results. We however do not judge any of these proposals; instead we give hints on how the attacks on VoIP networks could be further addressed.","","978-1-905824-43-4","","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2014.6880664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880664","DoS/DDoS attacks;IDS/IDPS;Mitigation;SIP;VoIP Defender","Computer architecture;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Floods;Proposals;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computer network security;signalling protocols","DoS-DDoS attacks;SIP based VoIP systems;Session Initiation Protocol;VoIP networks;denial-of-service attack;distributed denial-of-service attack;security frameworks;voice-over-Internet telephony","","0","","29","","","7-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although sensor nodes have low computation and communication capabilities, they have specific properties such as their stable neighborhood information that allows for detection of anomalies in networking and transceiver behaviors of the neighboring nodes. We show that such characteristics can be exploited as key enablers for providing security to large scale sensor networks. In many attacks against sensor networks, the first step for an attacker is to establish itself as a legitimate node within the network. To make a sensor node capable of detecting an intruder a simple dynamic statistical model of the neighboring nodes is built in conjunction with a low-complexity detection algorithm by monitoring received packet power levels and arrival rates.","","0-7803-9181-0","","10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512911","","Communication system security;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","mobile radio;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","detection based security scheme;dynamic statistical model;intrusion detection system;low-complexity detection algorithm;neighboring nodes;packet power levels;transceiver behaviors;wireless sensor networks","","36","","16","","","22-24 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IDSs play an important role in monitoring traffic behaviors in a computer network, identifying the anomalous activity and notifying the security analyst with current network status. Unfortunately, one of the IDSs' drawbacks is they produce a large number of false positives and non-relevant positives alerts that could overwhelm the security analyst. Therefore, the process of analyzing alerts in order to provide a more synthetic and high-level view of the attempted intrusions is needed. This process is called Alert Correlation. In this paper, we present commonly used alert correlation approaches and highlight their advantages and disadvantages from various perspectives. Subsequently, we summarize some current alert correlation models with their alert correlation approach.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836553","Alert Correlatios;Anomaly Detection;Intrusion Detection System;Misuse Detection","Computational modeling;Computers;Correlation;Data mining;Internet;Intrusion detection","security of data","IDS;alert correlation models;intrusion detection systems;malicious attempts;network intrusion attempts","","0","","35","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It helps to make work environment essential and reliable. Access control security technology mainly includes firewall technology, intrusion detection technology, and security auditing technology. These technologies still have some problems and shortages though they are matured in some degree. The expert system for preventing and auditing intrusion is a series of software and hardware systems for reducing the risk of computer network security. It is an effective closed loop control system that integrates with firewall, intrusion detection, and auditing trail analysis. It uses the learning ability of expert system to add knowledge and rules. Also it combines the characteristics of real-time and unreal-time to form an access control security system and enhance the security of the network.","","1-84600-002-5","","10.1109/CSCWD.2005.194297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504204","","Access control;Collaborative work;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer security;Control systems;Expert systems;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Software systems","computer networks;expert systems;groupware;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication security","CSCW;access control security system;closed loop control system;computer network security risk;computer supported cooperative work;expert system;firewall;intrusion auditing;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;security auditing;trail analysis auditing","","0","1","6","","","24-26 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our principle interest is to establish just how far such an approach can be taken in practice. To do so, the KDD benchmark dataset from the International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition is employed. This supplies a connection-based description of a factitious computer network in which each connection is described in terms of 41 features. Unlike previous approaches, only 6 of the most basic features are employed. The resulting system is capable of detection (false positive) rates of 89% (4.6%), where this is at least as good as the alternative data-mining approaches that require all 41 features.","1098-7576","0-7803-7898-9","","10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1223682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223682","","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer vision;Data mining;Internet;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Neurons;Testing","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","KDD benchmark dataset;SOM;computer network;data mining tools competition;international knowledge discovery;intrusion detection system;self-organizing feature maps;unsupervised learning","","22","","12","","","20-24 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a graph similarity-based approach to event detection and identification that integrates a number of techniques to collect time-varying situation information, extract correlations between event attributes, and characterize and identify security events. Diverging from the traditional rule- or statistical-based pattern matching techniques, the proposed mechanism represents security events in a graphical form of correlation networks and identifies security events through the computation of graph similarity measurements to eliminate the need for constructing user or system profiles. These technical components take fundamentally different approaches from traditional empirical or statistical methods and are designed based on rigorous computational analysis with mathematically proven performance guarantee. The performance superiority of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by extensive simulation and experimental results.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683648","","Computer security;Computers;Correlation;Data mining;Event detection;Monitoring","graph theory;knowledge based systems;pattern matching;security of data;statistical analysis","computational analysis;correlation networks;correlation techniques;cyber situation awareness;development community;event attributes;graph similarity measurements;graph similarity-based approach;network research;performance superiority;rule-based pattern matching techniques;security event analysis;security events detection;security events identification;statistical methods;statistical-based pattern matching techniques;time-varying situation information","","0","","22","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
