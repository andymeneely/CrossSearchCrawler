This approach models illegitimate users as ones who randomly access records. The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic.","","978-1-4673-6214-6","","10.1109/ISI.2013.6578795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578795","Access Logs;Anomaly Detection;Data Mining;Electronic Health Records;Healthcare Security;Insider threats","Context;Hospitals;Information systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Sociology;Statistics","data mining;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;random processes;security of data","LDA;ROA model;RTA;RTAD;anomalous topic access detection;anomalous topic access modeling;anomalous user detection;anomaly detection framework;attacker characteristics;feature extraction;healthcare;hospital audit logs;information systems;insider threat detection;k-NN algorithm;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;latent Dirichlet allocation;machine learning;model formalization;outlier detection;random object access model;random record access;random topic access detection;random topic access model;random users;statistics;strategy development;topic summarization;user roles;workflow knowledge","","0","","13","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. As part of an overall strategy for network resilience, a crucial requirement is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a novel solution that enables the progressive multi-stage deployment of resilience strategies, based on incomplete challenge and context information. Policies are used to orchestrate the interactions between various resilience mechanisms, which incrementally identify the nature of a challenge and deploy appropriate remediation mechanisms. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach via simulation of a resource starvation attack on an Internet Service Provider infrastructure. By initially using lightweight detection and then progressively applying more heavyweight analysis, a key contribution of our work is the ability to mitigate a challenge as early as possible and rapidly detect its root cause. The approach we propose in this paper has the flexibility, reproducibility and extensibility needed to assist in the identification and remediation of various network challenges in the future.","","978-1-61284-124-3","978-1-61284-123-6","10.1109/DRCN.2011.6076900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076900","","Accuracy;Computer crime;Context;IP networks;Monitoring;Reliability;Resilience","Internet;computer network reliability","Internet service provider infrastructure;adaptive approach;computer network resilience strategy;context information policy;heavyweight analysis;lightweight detection;malicious attack;progressive multistage deployment;remedial action;remediation mechanism;resilience mechanism;resource starvation attack","","8","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an example, the integration between telecommunication and physical processes, that happens when the power grid is managed and controlled, yields to epistemic uncertainty. Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied. The paper demonstrates how the use of the Reduced Power Set yields to more efficient algorithms for combining evidences and to application of Evidence Theory for assessing risk.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266730","","Electronic mail;Internet;Power grids;Risk management;Security;Uncertainty","Internet;fuzzy set theory;graph theory;knowledge based systems;risk management;security of data","Internet;cyber-physical layers;epistemic uncertainty management;fuzzy theory;graph representation;graph-based evidence theory;heterogeneous sources;power grid;reduced power set;risk assessment;risk evaluation;rule-based systems","","","","","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach to addressing this challenge would be to profile hosts that engage in scanning activity and predict their future actions. However, this requires understanding how hosts evolve their scanning behaviour. In order to address this issue we have analysed logs from the DShield repository of globally distributed IDS alerts corresponding to the first 15 days of January 2005. We first clustered hosts using similarities in the spatial breadth (targeted DShield subscribers) and depth (targeted destination ports) of their scanning activity during aggregation intervals of one day at a time. We then analysed temporal properties like popularity, volatility, lifetime and transition of these clusters to infer how they evolved over time. We found persistent clusters with stable sizes. However, they were highly volatile with a consistent turn-over of hosts everyday. This was caused by the lifetime of hosts in each cluster mostly being one day. Nevertheless, we came across a non-trivial number of hosts that appeared everyday while belonging to the same cluster or transitioning from one cluster to another. Based on these findings, it is plausible that suspicious hosts can be profiled for long periods of time to predict an imminent multistage attack.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319276","","Aggregates;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Internet;Intrusion detection;Recruitment;Size measurement;Software engineering;Spatiotemporal phenomena","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","DShield repository;Internet;aggregation interval;distributed IDS;evolution characterisation;imminent multistage attack detection;stable size;suspicious host scanning activity;temporal property","","0","3","13","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster based anomaly detection scheme by assigning few randomly chosen cluster heads a critical task of estimating the reliability of the mobile beacon node. As localization of remaining nodes is cautiously performed only after verifying the authenticity of the mobile beacon node, a considerable overhead is saved in the incorrect localization of the entire network.

International Conference on","20050725","2005","","","216","225","Common practice in anomaly-based intrusion detection assumes that one size fits all: a single anomaly detector should detect all anomalies. Compensation for any performance shortcoming is sometimes effected by resorting to correlation techniques, which could be seen as making use of detector diversity. Such diversity is intuitively based on the assumption that detector coverage is different - perhaps widely different - for different detectors, each covering some disparate portion of the anomaly space. Diversity, then, enhances detection coverage by combining the coverages of individual detectors across multiple sub-regions of the anomaly space, resulting in an overall detection coverage that is superior to the coverage of any one detector. No studies have been done, however, in which measured effects of diversity amongst anomaly detectors have been obtained. This paper explores the effects of using diverse anomaly-detection algorithms in intrusion detection. Experimental results indicate that while performance/coverage improvements can in fact be effected by combining diverse detection algorithms, the gains are not the result of combining large, non-overlapping regions of the anomaly space. Rather, the gains are seen at the edges of the space, and are heavily dependent on the parameter values of the detectors, as well as on anomaly characteristics. Based on this study, defenders can be provided with knowledge of how combinations of diverse, sequence-based detectors behave to effect detection performance superior to that of a single detector.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467796","","Computer science;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Diversity reception;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Performance gain;Protocols;Security","fault tolerant computing;performance evaluation;security of data","anomaly detector performance;anomaly-detection algorithm;intrusion detection;sequence-based detector","","0","","21","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","1533-2306","978-1-4577-1118-3","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","13","","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper shows us which type of features can aid us to achieve a better experimental result. In comparison to various types of intrusion attacks, the classical clustering algorithm, K-means is proposed to evaluate the features selected and prove the viewpoint based on KDD Cup 1999 DataSet. The knowledge of feature selection can be achieved by this means. With the usage of the statistics of network traffic, the better evaluation index, e.g. detection rate and false positive rate, are achieved than any other type of features.

An important component of the CPS devices is the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless, current security models consider protecting only networking components of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS devices. In this work, we focus on these novel sensory channel threats to CPS devices and applications. We first note how sensory channel threats are an emerging area for the CPS world. Then, we analyze the performance various sensory channel threats. Moreover, using an iRobot Create as our CPS platform, we exploit simple vulnerable programs on iRobot through its infrared channel. Finally, we introduce the design of a novel sensory channel aware intrusion detection system as a protection mechanism against the sensory channel threats for CPS devices.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997498","CPS Security;Cyber-Physical Systems;Sensory Attacks;Sensory-channel threats","Accelerometers;Malware;Robot sensing systems;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","invasive software","CPS;cyber physical systems;iRobot Create;intrusion detection system;malware;novel computing paradigm;security models;sensory channel threats;sensory channels","","0","","39","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, extending the functionality and the lifetime of products requires the addition of new functionality to track and satisfy the customers needs and market and technology trends. Many contemporary products along with the software part incorporate hardware accelerators for reasons of performance and power efficiency. While adaptivity of software is straightforward, adaptation of the hardware to changing requirements constitutes a challenging problem requiring delicate solutions.

By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware.

To overcome this problem, a systematic approach for eliciting additional and or missing safety requirements from textual description of use cases by the manual application of a well known software safety analysis (SSA) technique named Software Fault Tree Analysis (SFTA) has been proposed and presented in this paper. SFTA has been derived and applied in software from a similar hardware safety analysis technique named Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). The technique presented in this paper operates with the assumption that textual description of the use cases is correct.

Rather, they follow probabilistic models. Yet, many current connectivity maintenance protocols assume the disk communication model for convenience and ease of analysis. In addition, current protocols do not provide any assessment of the quality of communication between nodes. In this paper, we take a first step in designing connectivity maintenance protocols for more realistic communication models. We propose a distributed connectivity maintenance protocol that explicitly accounts for the probabilistic nature of communication links and achieves a given target communication quality between nodes. Our protocol is simple to implement, and we demonstrate its robustness against random node failures, inaccuracy of node locations, and imperfect time synchronization of nodes using extensive simulations. We compare our protocol against others in the literature and show that it activates fewer number of nodes, consumes much less energy, and significantly prolongs the network lifetime.","","978-1-4244-1454-3","978-1-4244-1455-0","10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4428600","","Computer networks;Lattices;Performance analysis;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","failure analysis;maintenance engineering;probability;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","connectivity maintenance protocols;disk communication model;distributed connectivity maintenance protocol;network connectivity;node failures;probabilistic communication models;time synchronization;wireless sensor networks","","5","","25","","","8-11 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Jaipur, Jaipur, India","Optimization, Reliabilty, and Information Technology (ICROIT), 2014 International Conference on","20140417","2014","","","156","160","Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) consist of peer-to-peer infrastructure less communicating nodes that are highly dynamic. As a result, routing data becomes more challenging. Ultimately routing protocols for such networks face the challenges of random topology change, nature of the link (symmetric or asymmetric) and power requirement during data transmission. Under such circumstances both, proactive as well as reactive routing are usually inefficient. We consider, zone routing protocol (ZRP) that adds the qualities of the proactive (IARP) and reactive (IERP) protocols. In ZRP, an updated topological map of zone centered on each node, is maintained. Immediate routes are available inside each zone. In order to communicate outside a zone, a route discovery mechanism is employed. The local routing information of the zones helps in this route discovery procedure. In MANET security is always an issue. It is possible that a node can turn malicious and hamper the normal flow of packets in the MANET. In order to overcome such issue we have used a clustering technique to separate the nodes having intrusive behavior from normal behavior. We call this technique as effective k-means clustering which has been motivated from k-means. We propose to implement Intrusion Detection System on each node of the MANET which is using ZRP for packet flow. Then we will use effective k-means to separate the malicious nodes from the network. Thus, our Ad-Hoc network will be free from any malicious activity and normal flow of packets will be possible.","","978-1-4799-3958-9","","10.1109/ICROIT.2014.6798303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798303","IARP;IDS effective k-means clustering;IERP;MANET;ZRP","Flowcharts;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Protocols;Routing","data mining;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing;routing protocols;telecommunication security","K-means clustering method;MANET security;ZRP based MANET;ad-hoc network;clustering technique;data mining;data transmission;intrusion detection system;intrusive behavior;k-means;local routing information;malicious activity;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;packet flow;peer-to-peer infrastructure;proactive protocols;random topology;reactive protocols;route discovery mechanism;route discovery procedure;routing data;zone routing protocol","","1","","8","","","6-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is one core in common between all dynamic web application and that is their need to use a database to store information inside that and retrieve that information upon the user request or add, edit and delete them. Among all database types, rational databases are very popular. Most of relational database management systems such as MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, MS Access, Postgres use SQL as their language. Flexibility of SQL makes it a powerful language. It allows the user to ask what information he wants without having any knowledge about how the information will be fetch. However vast use of SQL based databases make it the center of attention of hackers. SQL injection attack is a well-known security threat to database driven web applications. A successful SQL injection attack reveals critical confidential information to the hacker. In this paper first we provided background information on this vulnerability.

In DPI the packet payload is compared against a set of predefined patterns which can be specified using regular expressions (regexes). It is well-known that mapping regexes to deterministic finite automata (DFA) will suffer from the state explosion problem. Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided. Further, it achieves a fully automated signature compilation with polynomial running time and space.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501976","","Automata;Communications Society;Counting circuits;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;History;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Polynomials","","","","1","1","14","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a new framework aimed at slowing down or even preventing the propagation of computer worms and viruses in social networks. In the first part of the framework a social network has to be derived for a given community of users. In the second part the group of users that have the highest influence on the communication in the social network has to be located. The group betweenness centrality measure is used to evaluate the influence of each candidate group. In the third part we analyze the threat propagation in the social network assuming that a distributed network intrusion detection system (DNIDS) is monitoring the traffic of the group. The analysis is performed using a network simulator that was developed for this purpose. In the fourth part a DNIDS has to be deployed on a range of ISPs in order to monitor and clean the traffic of the users belonging to the central group. We applied the new framework by deriving the social network of 1000 students, finding the most influential group of users, and analyzing the influence of the deployment of DNIDS using a simulation tool.

Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.

To generalize the problem, the game data are assumed not to be fully known to the players, who take a robust optimization approach to address this data uncertainty. For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated. Equilibrium analysis reveals how the conflicting objectives of the intruder and intrusion detection system compel them to adopt different conservative stances toward data uncertainty.

In the detection phase the algorithm provides implementation of window size to detect intrusions that are temporally located. Also a threshold is implemented that is altered on basis of the process behavior. The system is tested with attacks that target different intrusion scenarios.

"How dynamic is the ISPs address space? Towards internet-wide DHCP churn estimation","Moura, G.C.M.; Ganan, C.; Lone, Q.; Poursaied, P.; Asghari, H.; van Eeten, M.","Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands","IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking), 2015","20150702","2015","","","1","9","IP address counts are typically used as a surrogate metric for the number of hosts in a network, as in the case of ISP rankings based on botnet infected addresses. However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","0","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With such a feature, the proposal system can identify whether each communication flow can be trusted or not by checking the querier's IP address and the DNS query target domain name. Then based on the result of checking, the firewall system adaptively decides specific operation for specific connection. Consequently, the trusted flows go through bypass route of higher bandwidth without heavy packet inspection while untrusted flows will be blocked or restricted by strict packet inspection.

Taxonomies based on attacker goals are attack-centric; those based on defender goals are defense-centric. Defenders need a way of determining whether or not their detectors will detect a given attack. It is suggested that a defense-centric taxonomy would suit this role more effectively than an attack-centric taxonomy. This paper presents a new, defense-centric attack taxonomy, based on the way that attacks manifest as anomalies in monitored sensor data. Unique manifestations, drawn from 25 attacks, were used to organize the taxonomy, which was validated through exposure to an intrusion-detection system, confirming attack detect ability. The taxonomy's predictive utility was compared against that of a well-known extant attack-centric taxonomy. The defense-centric taxonomy is shown to be a more effective predictor of a detector's ability to detect specific attacks, hence informing a defender that a given detector is competent against an entire class of attacks.","","0-7695-2052-9","","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311881","","Computer science;Detectors;Laboratories;Monitoring;Operating systems;Sensor systems;Taxonomy","authorisation;computer crime","Lincoln taxonomy;attack classification;attack detectability;attack manifestations;attack-centric taxonomy;defense-centric taxonomy;intrusion detection;sensor data monitoring","","12","","30","","","28 June-1 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The FUG (function unification grammar) in NLP is applied to intelligent query in IDS audit system, and XML (extension markup language) schema is utilized in expression of accidence, syntax, glossary library and grammar. At the same time, the feature structure is used to describe the structure of vocabulary, phrase and sentence. These measures can make the query system more intelligent, extendable and friendly.","","0-7803-8131-9","","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259874","","Intelligent systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Markup languages;Natural languages;Spatial databases;Terminology;Vocabulary;XML","XML;auditing;grammars;natural languages;query processing;security of data","XML;audit log file database;extension markup language;function unification grammar;intelligent query;intrusion detection system;natural language process technology","","0","","7","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A multiagent-based IDS (ABIDS) inspired by the danger theory of human immune system is proposed. The intelligence behind ABIDS is based on the functionality of dendritic cells in human immune systems and the danger theory, while dentritic cells agents (DC agent) are emulated for innate immune subsystem and artificial T-cell agents (TC agent) are for adaptive immune subsystem. Antigens are profiles of system calls while corresponding behaviors are regarded as signals. This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are ""embedded"" to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses. Accordingly, computer hosts met with malicious intrusions can be effectively detected via input signals and temporary output signals such as PAMP, danger and safe signals.","1098-7584","978-1-4244-7315-1","978-1-4244-7316-8","10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007564","artificial immune systems;dendritic cell algorithm;intrusion detection;multiagent","Adaptive systems;Computers;Context;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection","artificial immune systems;multi-agent systems;security of data","activation threshold;adaptive immune subsystem;agent-based artificial immune systems;artificial T-cell agents;computer host;danger theory;danger value calculation;dendritic cell functionality;dentritic cells agents;human immune system;innate immune subsystem;intrusion detection systems;malicious behaviors;malicious intrusions;mature context antigen value calculation;multiagent-based IDS;security operating center","","1","","14","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an efficient and distributed collaborative architecture that allows the placement and the cooperation of the defense entities to better address the main security challenges. The use of content based DHT (distributed hash table) algorithm permits also to improve the scalability and the load balancing of the whole system.

IDtk was developed through a user-centered design process, in which we identified design guidelines to support ID users. ID analysts protect their networks by searching for evidence of attacks in ID system output, firewall and system logs, and other complex, textual data sources. Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of information visualization techniques offers a valuable addition to the toolkit of the ID analyst. Several visualization techniques for ID have been developed, but few usability or field studies have been completed to assess the needs of ID analysts and the usability and usefulness of these tools. We intended to fill this gap by applying a user-centered design process in the development and evaluation of IDtk, a 3D, glyph-based visualization tool that gives the user maximum flexibility in setting up how the visualization display represents ID data. The user can also customize whether the display is a simple, high-level overview to support monitoring, or a more complex 3D view allowing for viewing the data from multiple angles and thus supporting analysis and diagnosis. This flexibility was found crucial in our usability evaluation.

The new method is based on the inherent feature of the TCP protocol, that is, two communicating peers keep synchronized with each other using data acknowledgment. This feature is converted as a balance mechanism in interactive TCP traffic replay and incorporated into the current state-based method. In this way, the cost of state-checking can be significantly reduced and the replay performance is thus enhanced. To validate the effectiveness of the method we implement it by building an interactive replay system. The experimental results indicate that: 1) balance-checking reduces the overhead of state-checking by 40%; 2) the balance-based method enhances the overall replay performance by an average of 5% when the actual TCP traffic traces are replayed.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501960","","Communication system traffic control;Communications Society;Costs;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","","","","1","","17","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection and decision process in an anomaly based IDS.","","978-0-7695-3258-5","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606112","Anomaly detection;Bayesian networks;Intrusion detection","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Electronic commerce;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;security of data","anomaly detection model;decision process;false alarms;incorrect event classification;intrusion detection system;two stratum Bayesian network","","1","","22","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The role of the fractional order controller is to introduce frequency-dependent damping of the forced oscillation of the system caused hills and valleys as well as by small dips and bumps on the road. It is pointed out that while the dashpot system serves as a nonlinear component saving the floor of the chassis its frequency transmission properties are undesirable in the higher frequency part of the excitation.

The detection engine of the system is based on the incremental mining of fuzzy association rules from network packets, in which membership functions of fuzzy variables are optimized by a genetic algorithm. The proposed online system belongs to anomaly detection, not misuse detection. Moreover, a mechanism for dynamic firewall updating is embedded in the proposed system for the function of eliminating suspicious connections when necessary.","","978-1-4244-8095-1","978-0-7695-4190-7","10.1109/ISPA.2010.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5634386","Fuzzy association rules;anomaly detection;genetic algorithm;membership functions;online incremental mining","Association rules;Biological cells;Databases;Floods;Genetics;IP networks;Intrusion detection","computer network security;data mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","LAN;anomaly traffic;firewall update;flooding attack;fuzzy association rules;genetic algorithm;incremental mining;online response system","","0","","18","","","6-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several sophisticated models have been proposed, evaluated and compared, showing very good results in many empirical or controlled studies. In general, network traffic forecasting can be conducted in an offline or online manner. An important aspect in both approaches is the quality control of the obtained predictions. This paper is focused on the quality control of online network traffic forecasts. We present a statistical process control based approach in order to keep in control online predictions of different network traffics. Our proposal is based on a combination of CUSUM and Shewhart control charts. We evaluate the proposed method using four different traffic samples collected from real LAN, MAN e WAN network environments.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7754-8","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546771","Network traffic analysis;control charts;forecasting;quality control","Accuracy;Autoregressive processes;Data models;Forecasting;Predictive models;Process control;Quality control","","","","2","","19","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Majority of the existing analysis systems primarily focus on internal host activity. In spite of the importance of network activity, only a limited set of analysis tools have recently started taking it into account. In this work, we study the value of network activity for malware classification by various antivirus products. Specifically, we ask the following question: How well can we classify malware according to network activity? We monitor the execution of a malware sample in a controlled environment and summarize the obtained high-level network information in a graph. We then analyze graphs similarity to determine whether such high-level behavioral profile is sufficient to provide accurate classification of malware samples. The experimental study on a real-world malware collection demonstrates that our approach is able to group malware samples that behave similarly.","","978-1-4673-0031-5","","10.1109/MALWARE.2011.6112321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112321","","Analysis of variance;Data mining;Electronic mail;Internet;Malware;Protocols;Software","graph theory;invasive software;pattern classification","antivirus products;dynamic malware analysis;exploring network based malware classification;graph theory;malware collection;malware sample;malware samples;network activity;static malware analysis","","2","","19","","","18-19 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is especially because attackers intervene in an automated way, at computer speed. Therefore, there is need of such intrusion detection and response systems, which detect and respond at the same speed so that damage may be minimized. We have designed an intrusion detection and response system prototype, based on mobile agents. Our agents travel between systems in a network, obtain information, classify and correlate the information and report to the manager of the intrusion detection and response system (IDRS) which is responsible for responding the attack.","","0-7803-8680-9","","10.1109/INMIC.2004.1492929","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1492929","","Command and control systems;Computer architecture;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Linux;Military computing;Mobile agents;Monitoring;Operating systems;Telecommunication traffic","mobile agents;security of data","computer security community;intrusion detection;mobile agent technology;response system","","1","","14","","","24-26 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Exfiltrations using polymorphic blending techniques: Analysis and countermeasures","Casenove, M.","Vrije Univ., Amsterdam, Netherlands","Cyber Conflict: Architectures in Cyberspace (CyCon), 2015 7th International Conference on","20150716","2015","","","217","230","Cyber espionage campaigns and cyber attacks make use of data exfiltration on a regular basis causing damages for billions of dollars. Nowadays, they represent one of the primary threats, and they are performed by criminals, companies and states. Normally, data exfiltration uses classic application-layer protocols (e.g. FTP or HTTP) in combination with very basic obfuscation mechanisms. Even though in most cases these techniques are effective enough, this paper describes how instead they can be detected using properly configured IDSs. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach named polymorphic blending exfiltration that serves to avoid detection from signature-based as well as anomaly-based IDSs. This technique permits to blend the exfiltrated data in the normal and legitimate traffic. We show how IDSs can be easily improved in order to be able to detect such exfiltration. Finally, we conclude presenting different evasion techniques that can be included in the polymorphic blending exfiltration to keep providing a safe undetectable exfiltration.","2325-5366","978-9-9499-5442-1","","10.1109/CYCON.2015.7158479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158479","IDS;cyber-espionage;exfiltration;obfuscation","Companies;Computers;Encryption;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Protocols","digital signatures;security of data","FTP;HTTP;anomaly-based IDSs;classic application-layer protocols;cyber attacks;cyber espionage campaigns;data exfiltration;intrusion detection system;legitimate traffic;polymorphic blending exfiltration;polymorphic blending techniques;signature-based IDSs","","0","","25","","","26-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
