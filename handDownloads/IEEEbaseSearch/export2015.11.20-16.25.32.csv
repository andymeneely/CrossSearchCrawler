In this paper we explore the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for such a purpose. Although GP has already been studied for this task, the inner features of network intrusion detection have been systematically ignored. To avoid the blind use of GP shown in previous research, we guide the search by means of a fitness function based on recent advances on IDS evaluation. For the experimental work we use a well-known dataset (i.e. KDD-99) that has become a standard to compare research although its drawbacks. Results clearly show that an intelligent use of GP achieves systems that are comparable (and even better in realistic conditions) to top state-of-the-art proposals in terms of effectiveness, improving them in efficiency and simplicity.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438073","effectiveness;efficiency;genetic programming;intrusion detection","Availability;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Telecommunication traffic","genetic algorithms;security of data","domain-aware genetic programming;fitness function;intrusive traffic;network intrusion detection;normal traffic","","2","","22","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Explicit Strategic Intelligence information available on such issues are in many cases vague, incomplete, sketchy or fragmented, rendering the process of discerning intentions reliant on tacit knowledge of experts in discerning intentions. The process of externalizing knowledge from Tacit to Explicit forms is one of the active areas of contemporary knowledge engineering research. This paper proposes a method based on Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps to objectively externalize the tacit knowledge of experts in such contexts to support better policy decision making.

Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942","Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort","Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data","MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component","","0","","19","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this approach, the inconsistencies often seen in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements are handled with a minimum of calibration. By taking off-line calibration measurement of a ZigBee sensor network, the inherent problem of signal uncertainty of to-be-localized nodes can be effectively resolved. The proposed RSSI-based algorithm allows flexible deployment of sensor nodes in various environments. The proposed algorithm has been verified in several typical environments and experiments show that the method outperforms existing algorithms. The location aware system has been integrated with an autonomous mobile robot to demonstrate the proposed on-demand robotic intruder detection system. In the experiments, three alarm sensors were employed to monitor abnormal conditions. If an intrusion was detected, the robot immediately moves to the location and transmits scene images to the user, allowing the user to respond to the situation in real time.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2277691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587583","Autonomous navigation;location aware system;received signal strength indicator;security robot;sensor network","Mobile nodes;Robot sensing systems;Security;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","Zigbee;calibration;intelligent robots;mobile robots;mobility management (mobile radio);probability;safety systems;service robots","RSSI measurements;ZigBee sensor network;calibration;intelligent behaviors;location aware module;mobile robot;on-demand robotic intrusion detection system;probability-based location aware design;received signal strength indicator;service robot","","1","","26","","2013-08-28","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Conventional detection systems using signature-based and/or rule-based anomaly detection techniques no longer suffice. It is difficult to predict what form the next malware attack will take and these pose a great challenge to the design of a robust intrusion detection system. We focus on the anomalous behavioral characteristics between attack and victim when they undergo sequences of compromising actions and that are inherent to the classes of vulnerability-exploit attacks. A new approach, Gestalt, is proposed to statefully capture and monitor activities between hosts and progressively assess possible network anomalies by multilevel behavior tracking, cross-level triggering and correlation, and a probabilistic inference model is proposed for intrusion assessment and detection. Such multilevel design provides a collective perspective to reveal more anomalies than individual levels. We show that Gestalt is robust and effective in detecting polymorphic, stealthy variants of known attacks.","","978-1-4244-5850-9","","10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541822","Anomaly detection;attack accessment;behavioral analysis;finite state machine;netwrok service","Automata;Computer science;Face detection;Information management;Information science;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","","","","2","","23","","","25-27 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a network anomaly detection technique based on SARIMA, a time-series model, to capture seasonal behavior of bandwidth usage of most networks. Our proposed SARIMA based anomaly detection is capable of detecting network bandwidth anomalies effectively when a threshold equals to 8.5 percents of maximum bandwidth in a day.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","365","369","As computer technology evolves and the threat of computer crimes increases, the apprehension and preemption of such violations become more and more difficult and challenging. To date, it appears that completely preventing breaches of security is unrealistic. Therefore, we must try to detect and classify these intrusions as they occur so that immediate actions may be taken to repair the damage and prevent further harm. One attempt at classifying these intrusions is MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list that provides a common name for all publicly known security weaknesses. The CVE dictionary, however, is not taxonomy. The CVE list is organized in simple numerical order by date of acceptance. Each entry in the dictionary includes a unique CVE identification number, a text description of the vulnerability and any pertinent references. Creating a self-organizing map (SOM) using the text description allows us to order attack profiles with common features in the same general area of the output space. Attacks in the general neighborhood of one another should be able to be mitigated by similar means. Plotting attacks on a SOM also enables us to visually examine the placement of an attack relative to the four common classes of attacks (Denial of Service, Deception, Reconnaissance, and Unauthorized Access). Many attacks have features in common with more than one of these classes rather than corresponding directly to a single class. We have developed an effective technique to classify new attacks using a unique taxonomy, which breaks down threats into the four general categories, and the SOM created by the baseline CVE descriptions.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437840","","Computer crime;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Dictionaries;Organizing;Reconnaissance;Software standards;Taxonomy;Web pages","authorisation;computer crime;self-organising feature maps","Kohonen map;MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure;computer attack classification;computer crime;computer security;self-organizing map;taxonomy;text description","","1","","7","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike the present approaches which assess the attack threat either from a backward perspective (how probable a security state can be reached) or from the perspective of the attacks themselves (how much an attack would cause damage to the network), this approach assesses the attack threat from a forwarding perspective (how probable it would be the precursor of future attacks). First, to every attack type and some attack scenarios, their probabilities of having following attacks(PFAs) are calculated by a data mining algorithm. Then the threats of real time intrusions are assessed by these probabilities. The result of the threat assessment can help identify the intrusion alerts which would be the best evidence for the coming attacks from tremendous amount of intrusion alerts, thus this approach can be used for intrusion prediction.

IEEE","20060320","2005","","","176","182 Vol. 1","We describe an approach to detecting coordinated attacks in tactical wireless networks in which distributed detectors cooperate to match signatures from audit events generated at different locations. Traditionally, the signature matching engine compares the signature with a single audit data stream to identify occurrences of the action sequence described in the signature. Such approach introduces a single point of failure and uses huge bandwidth for transferring audit data from the data sources to the matching engine. Our approach decomposes an extended infinite state machine, an operational representation of an attack signature, into multiple cooperative finite state machines that enable distributed signature engines to match the signature. We describe the decomposition methodology and the distributed matching algorithm and illustrate them using several example multi-stage attacks in tactical networks. In addition, we implemented an example distributed signature matching engine for detecting the example attacks in a simulation framework based on MASON. Our approach avoids a single point of failure and reduces the bandwidth usage by communicating internal state information rather than audit events","","0-7803-9393-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605682","","Bandwidth;Collaboration;Detectors;Engines;Event detection;Government;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Wireless networks","finite state machines;military communication;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","MASON;attack signature;cooperative signature-based detectors;coordinated attacks detection;extended infinite state machine;internal state information;multistage attacks;signature matching engine;single audit data stream;tactical wireless networks","","2","","8","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an effort to solve this problem, researchers have explored different methods of visualizing network security threats. There is little debate that humans can perceive more information visually than textually. The problem is that the majority of visualization tools in practice or proposed do not take efficient visualization techniques into consideration. As a result, it is difficult to get a high-level view of the network that facilitates rapid isolation of network attacks. We propose the Converged Security Visualization Tool (Cover-VT) to solve the efficient visualization problem. Cover-VT was designed to provide analysts with a high-level view of network threats using geographic information systems. The tool allows for rapid identification of threats by minimizing the cognitive obstacles to efficient threat location. Cover-VT includes the capability to drill-down on a node of interest for additional details and even filter out unwanted data. Cover-VT was designed with usability in mind, making it easy to comprehend while assisting the analyst in rapid threat identification. Many different security tools make up a security analyst's tool kit. Cover-VT was developed as an effective security visualization system that integrates existing security tools and network security systems.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990663","Converged Security;Security Management;Visualization","Fires;Monitoring;Visualization","data visualisation;geographic information systems;information networks;security of data","Cover-VT;converged security visualization tool;geographic information systems;network attacks;network security systems;network security threats;rapid threat identification;security analysts;threat location","","0","","16","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities (SQLIV) through successful attacks might result in severe consequences such as authentication bypassing, leaking of private information etc. Therefore, testing an application for SQLIV is an important step for ensuring its quality. However, it is challenging as the sources of SQLIV vary widely, which include the lack of effective input filters in applications, insecure coding by programmers, inappropriate usage of APIs for manipulating databases etc. Moreover, existing testing approaches do not address the issue of generating adequate test data sets that can detect SQLIV. In this work, we present a mutation-based testing approach for SQLIV testing. We propose nine mutation operators that inject SQLIV in application source code. The operators result in mutants, which can be killed only with test data containing SQL injection attacks. By this approach, we force the generation of an adequate test data set containing effective test cases capable of revealing SQLIV. We implement a MUtation-based SQL Injection vulnerabilities Checking (testing) tool (MUSIC) that automatically generates mutants for the applications written in Java Server Pages (JSP) and performs mutation analysis. We validate the proposed operators with five open source web-based applications written in JSP. We show that the proposed operators are effective for testing SQLIV.","1550-6002","978-0-7695-3312-4","","10.1109/QSIC.2008.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601530","","Authentication;Automatic testing;Databases;Filters;Genetic mutations;Java;Multiple signal classification;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Programming profession","Java;SQL;program compilers;program testing;security of data","Java Server Pages;authentication bypassing;mutation analysis;mutation-based SQL injection vulnerability checking;mutation-based testing approach;private information;source code","","16","","22","","","12-13 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","2","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Novelty detection, the ability to identify new or previously unknown situations, is a useful ability for learning systems, especially when dealing with data streams, where concepts may appear, disappear, or evolve overtime. There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime. We propose a new methodology to associate the novelty patterns detected by the algorithm, in an unsupervised fashion, with the true classes. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology through the use of known novelty detection algorithms with artificial and real data sets.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2441713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118190","Evaluation methodologies;data streams;evaluation methodology;novelty detection","Context;Data mining;Decision support systems;Electronic mail;Mathematical model;Measurement uncertainty;Time measurement","data mining;matrix algebra;unsupervised learning","artificial data sets;confusion matrix;data stream mining;evaluation measures;evaluation methodology;knowledge extraction;learning systems;multiclass novelty detection algorithms;nonstationary distribution;novelty patterns;real data sets;true classes;unsupervised learning","","0","","47","","2015-06-04","Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among the various network security measures, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role to integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources. It seems that the presence of uncertainty and the imprecise nature of the intrusions make fuzzy systems suitable for such systems. Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks. This paper evaluates performance of ANFIS in the forms of binary and multi-classifier to categorize activities of a system into normal and suspicious or intrusive activities. Experiments for evaluation of the classifiers were performed with the KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. The Overall Results show that ANFIS can be effective in detecting various intrusions.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276608","ANFIS;Computer network Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;Neuro-Fuzzy classifier","Availability;Communication system security;Computer networks;Computer security;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Learning;Protocols","fuzzy set theory;security of data","KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer networks;network intrusion detection;neurofuzzy classification","","1","","17","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By exploiting vulnerability in existing protocols and infrastructures, malicious attackers consume resources in networks and servers to block or degrade the service to legitimate users. TCP is the dominant network transport protocol. It relies on the participating hosts' cooperation to make data transmission successful. This kind of trust has been exploited in some DoS attacks, such as SYN-flooding attack. In this paper, we investigate how a TCP client can extend the duration of its connection with a server only by setting the pace of sending back acknowledgement packets. Our study shows that the duration of a TCP connection could be extended tens of times without incurring timeout retransmission. This mechanism can potentially be used by attackers to launch DoS attacks by generating simultaneous prolonged TCP connections with the victim servers. Unlike SYN-flooding attacks, the low rate property of slow TCP connections makes the detection of this kind of attack difficult, which calls for a further study on this issue.","0191-2216","0-7803-8682-5","","10.1109/CDC.2004.1428610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1428610","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Contracts;Data communication;Degradation;Delay;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Transport protocols","client-server systems;internetworking;telecommunication services;transport protocols","SYN-flooding attack;client-controlled slow TCP;denial of service attacks;information infrastructure;network transport protocol","","1","","20","","","14-17 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be highly effective, NIDS must perform packet inspection of incoming traffic at or near wire speed. Failing to do so will allow malicious packets to sneak through the network undetected, and thus jeopardising network security. Snort is one of the most popular IDS and intrusion prevention system (IPS) applications. Snort is a publicly available open-source NIDS application that typically runs on Linux. In this study, the authors present and discuss the essential software components of Snort and its underlying Linux support architecture. The authors characterise Snort execution and present an analytical queuing model to give insight into understanding the kernel and Snort behaviour as well as to identify key-dominating factors that strongly influence and impact Snort performance. The authors demonstrate that the current default configurations of the packet reception mechanism of the Linux networking subsystem (a.k.a. NAPI) are not suitable for Snort performance and show that the performance of Snort can be improved significantly by tuning certain configuration parameters, specifically by having a small NAPI budge value of 2. The performance is measured in terms of throughput and packet loss. The authors also measure the packet loss encountered at the kernel level as well as the interrupt rate of incoming traffic. Performance was measured when subjecting a PC host running Snort to both normal and malicious traffic, and with different traffic load conditions.","1751-8628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2009.0114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5343506","","","Linux;computer networks;queueing theory;reception;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Linux;NIDS;Snort performance;analytical queuing model;computer network;intrusion prevention system;malicious packets;network intrusion detection system;network security;network throughput;network traffic;networking subsystem;packet inspection;packet loss;packet reception","","4","","","","","December 2009","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The novel strategy involves a hybrid statistical approach involving Bayesian and Discriminant Analysis Classification. This comprises discriminant analysis of the normal and attack traffic after using Bayes Theorem to evaluate the training data. The results of the statistical analysis is fed into the IDS to reduce misclassification of false positives and distinguish between attacks and false positives in the IDS alert monitor.

Prevention techniques lead to different models, each suitable for a single type of misbehavior, but do not guarantee the protection of a system from a more general DoS attack. We analyze the fundamental requirements to be satisfied in order to protect hosts and routers from any form of distributed DoS (DDoS).

For the first stage we use two alternatives, self-organizing map (SOM) with k-means algorithm and neural GAS with fuzzy c-means algorithm.

Most of the AIS models, however, emphasize designing artifacts - computational algorithms, techniques using simplified models of various immunological processes and functionalities. Like other biologically-inspired techniques, such as artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, and cellular automata, AISs also try to extract ideas from the BIS in order to develop computational tools for solving science and engineering problems.

The problem with such a system is that it cannot detect novel attacks whose signature is not available and hence generates a high rate of alerts. In this paper Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation algorithm is used to classify attacks. We train and test MLP with KDD99 training dataset. We use KDD99 dataset which is a subset of the DARPA dataset. It is a preprocessed dataset and is most suitable for our system. We analyze the working of MLP by performing various experiments. We observed that MLP Neural network requires large training time.

Although the session hijacking is not in the forefront of everyone mind, it still remains a commonly used attack in MANET. Session hijack attacks are defined as taking over an active TCP/IP communication session without their permission or knowledge. When implemented successfully, attackers assume the identity of the compromised user, enjoying the same access to resources as the compromised user. Network protocols like FTP, Telnet, and rlogin are especially attractive to the attacker, because of the session oriented nature of their connections, and lack of implementation of any security during login, authentication, or data transmission. We introduce a novel method for defending session hijacking attack in MANET: Pseudo Random Alteration of Sequence Numbers (PRAS). Based on the comprehensive evaluation based on simulations, it is shown that PRAS can successfully defend session hijacking under diverse mobile multi-hop network environment with low communication, computation, and memory overhead.","","","","10.1109/ICCT.2013.6820344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820344","Mobile Ad hoc Networks;Sequence number;Session hijacking;TCP attacks","Ad hoc networks;Computer crime;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Receivers;Servers","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;random sequences;telecommunication security;transport protocols","FTP;MANET;PRAS;TCP-IP communication session;Telnet;authentication;data transmission;diverse mobile multihop network environment;mobile ad hoc network;network protocol;pseudorandom alteration of sequence number;rlogin;security;session hijacking attack","","1","","14","","","17-19 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an intrusion detection system (IDS) for MANETs at the application layer. The IDS utilizes (1) both anomaly and misuse detection schemes to identify attacks in MANETs and (2) mobile agents (MAs) to augment each node's intrusion-detection capability. In particular, each node is equipped with a local IDS, and MAs will be dispatched periodically or on-demand to augment each node's IDS.

Climatic factors are important in influencing the incidence of dengue. It is important to determine the relationships between climatic factors and disease incidence trends, which would be helpful for relevant environment and health agencies in planning appropriate pre-emptive control measures. Climatic factors and dengue case records vary over time. It is therefore difficult to justify the time-lag when a climatic factor affects the mosquito-to-human and human-to-mosquito loops. In this paper, we propose to use support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for analyzing the time- series dengue data and genetic algorithm (GA), to determine the time-lags and subset of climatic factors as effective factors influencing the spread of dengue.

To protect their business models, botnet operators constantly improve their protocols and applications to harden them against detection, analysis and takedown efforts. Our analysis suggest that future botnets will use proper encryption for their protocol messages, rendering them invisible to most deployed network intrusion detection systems. Therefore, we identify properties of botnet communications that will not be obscured by these measures. This allows us to design features which can be derived by measuring these properties and used as input to an approach for detecting systems infected with a botnet client. First measurements on network traffic generated by legitimate applications and a botnet client suggest that our features are capable of reliably discriminating between the two.","","978-1-4673-1422-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6387926","botnet;intrusion detection;netflow","Cryptography;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","computer crime;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication traffic","botnet communication;botnet detection;business model protection;encryption;legitimate applications;network intrusion detection system;network traffic characteristics;network traffic measurement;online crime;protocol messages","","0","","21","","","8-9 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately layerl-aware NIDS/NIPSs pose crucial implementation issues because they require full TCP/IP reassembly without losing (1) complete prevention, (2) performance, (3) application transparency, or (4) transport transparency. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches meet all of these requirements. Our store-through does this by forwarding each out-of-order or IP-fragmented packet immediately after copying it even if it has not been checked yet. Although the forwarded packet might turn out to be a part of an attack, the store-through can successfully defend against the attack by blocking one of the subsequent packets. Testing of a prototype in linux kernel 2.4.30 demonstrated that the overhead of our mechanism is negligible compared with that of a simple IP forwarder even with the presence of out-of-order packets.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-1520-5","978-1-4244-1521-2","10.1109/ISCC.2007.4381605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381605","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Out of order;Protocols;Prototypes;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","IP networks;security of data;transport protocols","IP-fragmented packet;Linux kernel;TCP reassembler mechanism;application transparency;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;transport transparency","","2","","25","","","1-4 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After examining the various existing defending mechanisms for WS, it is found that they are not adaptive and adequate in counter-measuring the WS attacks. An adaptive intrusion detection and prevention (ID/IP) framework to protect the WS against attacks related to SOAP/XML/SQL is thus introduced. Through illustration by examples, the framework demonstrated that by making use of agents that act as sensors, data mining techniques such as clustering, association and sequential rule coupled with fuzzy logic to further analyze and identify anomalies, is able to exhibit the adaptive nature of capturing anomalies and avoiding false alarms.","","0-7695-3038-9","","10.1109/ICCIT.2007.422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420313","","Computer crime;Electronic mail;Fuzzy logic;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Protection;Simple object access protocol;Web services;XML","Web services;security of data","Web service platform;Web service security;Web technology;adaptive intrusion detection;adaptive intrusion prevention","","7","","29","","","21-23 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

Without loss of generality, feature selection can effectively improve the classification model performance, study on the feature selection-based intrusion detection method is therefore very necessary. This paper proposes a simple and quick inconsistency-based feature selection method. Data inconsistency is firstly employed to find the optimal features, and the sequential forward search is then utilized to facilitate the selection of subset features. The tests on KDD99 benchmark data show that the proposed feature selection method can directly eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, without degenerating the classification performance. Furthermore, due to experiments, the intrusion detection performance using the proposed method is also a little advantageous than that with the general CFS method.","","978-1-4244-9114-8","978-0-7695-4297-3","10.1109/CIS.2010.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5696311","Discretization;Feature Selection;Inconsistent Rate;Intrusion Detection","","optimisation;real-time systems;security of data","data inconsistency;data selection;feature selection method;intrusion detection rate;network environments;network intrusion detection application;optimal features;real-time processing;resource consumption","","1","","19","","","11-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For that importance, IDS has become one of targeted research area that focuses on information security. Among different techniques, Enhanced Steady State Genetic-Based Machine Learning Algorithm (ESSGBML) offers the ability to detect intrusions especially in changing environments. The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless features leads to a simplified problem and enhance detection rate. By combining different selected features that will be evaluated, where this will lead us to determine suitable combination features to attain best results. In ESSGBML, Zeroth Level Classifier System (ZCS) plays the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether it is normal or intrusion. For GA, the probability of crossover will be enhanced by applying fuzzy logic. The experiments and evaluations for compound methods were performed on KDD 99 dataset to detect network intrusions.","","978-1-4673-2226-3","","10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360644","","Feature extraction;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Probes;Training;Zero current switching","fuzzy logic;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","ESSGBML;IDS;KDD 99 dataset;ZCS;business networks;compound methods;crossover probability;detection rate enhancement;dynamic environments;enhanced steady state genetic-based machine learning algorithm;feature selection enhancement;fuzzy logic;information security;intrusion detection system;mobile networks;zeroth level classifier system","","0","","15","","","1-3 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Third International Conference on","20080715","2008","","","17","22","Flow based traffic measurement today is a very important tool for network management but suffers from huge amounts of data and a lack of scalability. Therefore it is important to find methods to reduce that amount of data for applications like long-term archiving or filtering in mediators to improve scalability. A fact that helps here is, that general internet traffic has power-law characteristics and that for many applications it is enough to only look at the large flows. In this work we introduce Mouse Trapping, a flow data reduction method that keeps the large flow records, while the small flow records are aggregated or even removed. We show based on theoretical simulation, that because of the heavy-tail nature of normal flow data, the main part of the traffic is represented by only a few large flow records, while the small flow records represent only a small part of the traffic. In an evaluation with real traffic data we can confirm that the traffic flows are in fact mostly power-law distributed. We can show that with this method, flow data can be reduced by up to 90% if all small flow records are just discarded, affecting only flow records of 5% of the traffic.","","978-0-7695-3189-2","978-0-7695-3189-2","10.1109/ICIMP.2008.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561321","flows;network measurement;power-law;reduction","Computerized monitoring;Filtering;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Internet;Mice;Protection;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","data analysis;data reduction;traffic","flow based traffic measurement;flow data reduction method;flow records;mouse trapping;network management;power-law distributed","","1","1","15","","","June 29 2008-July 5 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evolutionary algorithms do global search in order to discover new interesting classification rules. GNP is found better than other evolutionary algorithms due to its structure. This paper describes how evolutionary computing technologies are better to build a classifier with minimum number of class association rules and maximizing accuracy of classified patterns in intrusion detection problem.","","978-1-4673-2922-4","","10.1109/PDGC.2012.6449904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449904","Data Mining;Evolutionary Computation;Fuzzy Classification rules;IDS","Association rules;Integrated circuits","data handling;data mining;evolutionary computation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;search problems;security of data","boundary vagueness problem;classification rules;classified pattern accuracy maximization;evolutionary computing technologies;evolutionary soft computing techniques;fuzzy class association rules;fuzzy partitioning scheme;global search;intrusion detection system;minimum class association rule number;quantitative data handling;simple partitioning scheme","","1","","35","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the properties of the self-* management vision, self-healing figures as a key property to improve the dependability of the managed infrastructures. An interesting possibility to materialize self-* support in disruption-tolerant management is through the employment of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology. In this paper, we introduce a P2P self-healing service tailored for disruption-tolerant management. We implemented the proposed service using ManP2P-ng, an open source P2P-based network management system. In addition, an experimental evaluation is performed considering as case study the disruption-tolerant management of a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) deployed on a specific kind of DTN: Internet access networks for remote villages. The results show the feasibility of our proposal and its interesting features.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755026","","Computer architecture;Delays;Internet;Maintenance engineering;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols","Internet;authorisation;computer network security;fault tolerant computing;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network management","DTN;HIDS;Internet access network;ManP2P-ng;P2P technology;disruption-tolerant management;host-based intrusion detection system;network management system;open source P2P;peer-to-peer technology;self-healing property","","1","","8","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
