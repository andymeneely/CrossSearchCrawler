The integration of power grids with ICT to build Smart Grids (SGs) has reduced costs and improved their performances. But, on the other hand, this has also brought the cyber security threats as well. In traditional ICT systems, the end devices are the powerful systems which have high computation power and memory capacity to perform the intense computations to avoid cyber security threats, whereas most of the end devices in SG lack these capabilities. Incorporating the security in the early stages of SG development through systems security requirements engineering can reduce the potential cyber security threats. This paper presents the results of applying Security Requirements Engineering Process (SREP) on the SG wireless network, and proposes the potential solutions that can be implemented such as using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)-enabled Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) with Global Positioning System (GPS) support.","","","","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682167","","Communication system security;Energy management;Home appliances;Power grids;Security;Wireless networks","power system economics;power system reliability;radio networks;smart power grids;telecommunication security","GPS;GSM;ICT;cyber security;global positioning system;global system for mobile communication;information and communication technology;intelligent electronic devices;power grids;security requirements engineering process;smart grid wireless network security;smart grids","","1","","35","","","20-23 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the modern intrusion detection systems lack the ability to process massive data streams to achieve anomaly detection. Instead of Intrusion detection, Intrusion prevention system can be used for both servers and end-hosts to handle the dual challenges of accuracy and performance which the former lacks. Intrusion prevention can be done by processing the data stream on fly. It is a difficult issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. Many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items, and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. Our method is employed to prevent the system with high efficiency and low use of system resources.","","978-1-4673-2981-1","","10.1109/CICN.2012.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375255","Data Stream;Frequent Pattern Mining;Intrusion Prevention","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data mining;Data models;Intrusion detection;Servers","data mining;security of data","anomaly intrusion prevention;intrusion detection;massive data streams;network security architecture;online frequent item set mining;time-sensitive sliding window","","0","","12","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, users store large amounts of data as documents, text files, databases, and more relevant to this work, system logs. Current cloud services are getting more decoupled with each layer in the cloud stack generating different logs for network, applications, database, and programming interfaces on different machines. At any point in time, cloud providers, users, or application developers arguably require to understand the status of different components, monitor business processes, and analyse machine logs in real time. However, there are no specialised search engines for the systematic analysis of logs by different cloud providers. Hence, this paper presents Simha, an agent-based document search service for cloud platforms. It implements a proof of concept system to analyse user documents, logs, and folders in real time from different virtual machines. Based on an Elastic search server, our overall search process has been extended to distributively search data stored into cloud.

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET. Simulation results that evaluate our scheme based on the trust management metrics we have defined demonstrate its performance benefits.","1550-445X","978-1-4673-0714-7","","10.1109/AINA.2012.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184895","Local Broadcast;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Replication;Semantic Aware;Trust Management","Availability;Buffer storage;Jamming;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing","meta data;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad-hoc network;resource conservation;semantics-aware storage;trust management metrics;trust metadata replication","","0","","28","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering can be made effective in CEAACK MANETs by opting for a cluster head mechanism which ensures that control rests with a single powerful node within a cluster. This cluster head takes on the responsibility of routing the packets efficiently by coordinating with the base station. Cluster heads are also prone to malicious attacks and is affected more than a normal network. In this paper we try to incorporate a new approach in CEAACK MANETs by implementing a cryptographic technique to tackle the vulnerabilities of the network. This cryptographic is highly secure which uses a distinct classified digital key which can be generated dynamically using the Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) Algorithm. This technique can ensure that data is securely transmitted in a reliable manner.

In addition, cloud computing and big data analytics are being integrated. They allow network to change itself much faster to service requirements with better operational efficiency and intelligence. IoT should also be vertically optimized from device to application in order to provide ultra-low power operation, cost-effectiveness, and service reliability with ensuring full security across the entire signal path.

An asynchronous messaging network (or simply messaging network) refers to an overlay network (over LAN, VPN, Internet, etc.) that allows exchanging well-formatted asynchronous messages (typically in XML) between the service providers and consumers in the system. The proposed approach aims at reducing the operation and maintenance cost of the system by using a messaging network enhanced with the capability to store, inspect and analyze selected portions of the exchanged messages under the strict control of security and privacy. Complexity makes any information system vulnerable to design flaws, operation error, and security problems. The proposed approach facilitates analyzing these problems associated with complex SOA systems through the message-store analysis. We consider that the application of computer forensics to the message store in SOA helps the system administrator to identify and fix various problems. The requirements for the messaging network for SOA systems are also presented.","","978-1-4673-0867-0","","10.1109/WAINA.2012.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6185284","SOA;forensics;message mediation;messaging network","Computers;Forensics;History;Information systems;Security;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Service oriented architecture","computational complexity;computer forensics;data privacy;overlay networks;service-oriented architecture","SOA system complexity;asynchronous messaging network;computer forensics;maintenance cost reduction;message forensics;message privacy;message security;message-store analysis;operation cost reduction;overlay network;service oriented architecture","","0","","27","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The high rate of patients infected with type II DM is caused by late diagnosis, therefore, early detection of disease is necessary to classify the detected patients with type II diabetes mellitus, and undetected patients. Moreover, analyzing the determinant and major attributes are highly recommended. In this research is implemented the combined Classification methods between Regression Tree method (CART) and Random Forest (RF) to build the classification model that is used in the early detection of diabetes mellitus type II disease. Those methods are selected based on the characteristics of the dataset used in medical records that consist of complex attributes consisting of several categorical attributes and continuous attributes, besides the advantages of the CART models are easy to implement, and it can explore the structure of complex medical records, while the RF method can handle the problem in accuracy. This research has tested a different number of trees and numbers of candidate attributes splitter. Based on the test results, it shows that the addition of trees and attributes splitter can improve the accuracy and reduce the error rate, with the optimal inputs are 50 numbers of trees and 3 number of attributes splitter with 83,8% average accuracy.

In order to meet the real-time performance requirements imposed on these security applications, developing a high-speed parallelization technique is essential for the AC algorithm. In this paper, we present a new memory efficient parallelization technique which efficiently places and caches the input text data and the reference data in the on-chip shared memories and texture caches of the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). Furthermore, the new approach efficiently schedules memory accesses in order to minimize the overhead in loading data to the on-chip shared memories. The approach cuts down the effective memory access latencies and leads to significant performance improvements.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively. The algorithm is independent of specific applications so that many ideas and solutions can be transferred to other classifier paradigms.","","978-1-4244-4786-2","978-1-4244-4787-9","10.1109/ICADVC.2009.5377998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377998","","Application software;Control systems;Energy consumption;Humanoid robots;Hydraulic actuators;Induction motors;Intrusion detection;Legged locomotion;Robot control;Testing","computer network security;data mining;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","computer networks;data mining;databases process;feature selection;information extraction;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor classifier;knowledge discovery;map data classification;supervised learning","","0","","27","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With virtualization platform administrators tasked with preventing attacks in order to provide uninterrupted service, existing intrusion detection technologies are continuously challenged. Consequently, this paper proposes a Centralized Administration and Dynamic Monitoring framework (CADM) based on virtualization for network intrusion detection. CADM is able to centrally administrate, and monitor network behavior in the virtual computing environment by automatically deploying and updating intrusion detection processes and rules. In the aspect of monitoring capability, CADM allows the monitoring locations in intrusion detection to be automatically adjusted in real time, thus adapting to the dynamic changes (such as migration) of virtual machines (VMs). Moreover, the monitoring processes involved in intrusion detection could also be automatically updated by dynamically updating security strategies. In the aspect of monitoring granularity, CADM is able to monitor network interfaces of each virtual machine (VM) for fine-grained network intrusion detection and network traffic acquisition. Our experimental results demonstrate that more convenient and efficient monitoring and administrating capabilities are available with CADM for virtualization platform administrators.","","978-1-4799-2418-9","","10.1109/PDCAT.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6904241","Centralized Management;Dynamic Update;Network Intrusion Detection;Virtualization Security Monitoring","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Servers;Virtualization","security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","CADM;VM;centralized administration;dynamic monitoring framework;fine-grained network intrusion detection;intrusion detection technologies;monitoring granularity;network traffic acquisition;virtual computing environment;virtual machines;virtual network structure;virtualization platform administrators;virtualization technology","","0","","17","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, the toolkits have low efficacies in matching each packet with all the detection rules to avoid false positives. Unfortunately, there are no automatic functionalities to debug expert systems so that all noisy signatures and rules set that trigger false alerts are isolated. Hence, heuristic methods are wrongly applied in realistic networks. Consequently, there are alarming cases of network attacks despite the inclusion of network detectors on the networks. Therefore, this paper presents an automated approach that enable system administrators to debug network detectors.

The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion.

An IDS can be a piece of installed software or a physical appliance that monitors network traffic in order to detect unwanted activity and events such as illegal and malicious traffic, traffic that violates security policy, and traffic that violates acceptable use policies. However, Intrusion detection systems face a number of challenges. One of the important challenges is that, the input data to be classified is in a high dimension feature space. In this paper, we are trying to present MSPSO-DT intrusion detection system. Where, Multi Swam Particle Swarm Optimization (MSPSO) is used as a feature selection algorithm to maximize the C4.5 Decision Tree classifier detection accuracy and minimize the timing speed. To evaluate the performance of the presented MSPSO-DT IDS we are trying to use several experiments on NSL-KDD benchmarked network intrusion detection dataset.","","978-1-4799-2525-4","","10.1109/SCEECS.2014.6804504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6804504","Decision Tree;Feature Selection;Intrusion Detection System;Multi Swam Particle Swarm Optimization;Network Security","Classification algorithms;Computer science;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Servers","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;feature selection;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","C4.5 decision tree classifier detection accuracy;MSPSO-DT IDS;MSPSO-DT intrusion detection system;acceptable use policies;data mining technology;feature selection algorithm;high dimension feature space;illegal traffic;malicious traffic;multiswam particle swarm optimization;network intrusion detection dataset;network traffic detection;network traffic monitoring;physical appliance;security policy;unwanted activity detection","","0","","22","","","1-2 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The open medium makes MANET more vulnerable to malicious attackers. Many methods like acknowledgement based systems and monitoring methods are proposed to provide secure MANET. In acknowledgment based system, crytographic techniques are used to provide security against false misbehavior report, limited transmission power and receiver collision problems which creates network and routing overhead and fails to address problems like partial dropping.

Data mining has been popularly recognized as an important way to mine useful information from large volumes of data which is noisy, fuzzy, and random.

As such, this paper proposes an approach (supported by a system) which will complement security requirements engineering methodologies by gathering continuous evidence to inform on whether the security requirements elucidated during system development stage have been correctly implemented and as such, they can be relied upon to effectively protect system assets at runtime.

We introduce the concept of a Wireless Control Network (WCN) where the entire network itself acts as the controller. Specifically, at each time-step, each node updates its internal state to be a linear combination of the states of the nodes in its neighborhood. We show that this causes the entire network to behave as a linear dynamical system, with sparsity constraints imposed by the network topology. We then provide a numerical design procedure to determine the appropriate linear combinations to be applied by each node so that the transmissions of the nodes closest to the actuators will stabilize the plant. We also show how our design procedure can be modified to maintain mean square stability under packet drops in the network.","0743-1546","978-1-4244-7745-6","","10.1109/CDC.2010.5717159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5717159","","Actuators;Delay;Linear matrix inequalities;Network topology;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","control system synthesis;linear systems;network topology;networked control systems;radio networks;stability","linear dynamical system;mean square stability;network topology;networked control schemes;wireless control network;wireless nodes","","10","","18","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed tool will utilize Snort rules in the model creation process where a Snort rule is transformed into XML and MSC models. Besides Snort rules, the proposed tool is able to utilize network traffic traces stored in a packet capture format (Pcap). These traces may contain diverse set of different network activities that are relevant in gaining unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. Using these traces the proposed tool can create XML and MSC models that depict the malicious activities. The experimental utilization of the proposed tool will indicate that the XML and MSC models can be created fast and automatically using two separate sources and this will reduce the amount manual work required in the modelling process.","","978-1-4577-1717-8","","10.1109/ComComAp.2012.6154805","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6154805","MSC;Modelling;Pcap;Snort rule;XML;network intrusion detection","Analytical models;Generators;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Unified modeling language;XML","XML;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","MSC model;Snort rules;XML notation;computer network;computer system;extensible mark-up language notation;message sequence chart notation;network activity;network intrusion detection model;network traffic trace;packet capture format;protocol header information;unauthorized access;vulnerability exploitation attempt","","0","","24","","","11-13 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compromise of concentrators can be detected. The aggregated data is protected using Chameleon Signatures and then forwarded to the utility back-end for verification, accounting, and analysis. Using the Trapdoor Chameleon Hash Function, the smart meters can periodically send an evidence to the utility back-end, by computing an alternative message and a random value (m', r) such that m' consists of all previous energy usage measurements of the smart meter in a specified period of time. By verifying that the Chameleon Hash Value of (m', r) and that the energy usage matches those aggregated by the concentrators, the utility back-end is convinced of the integrity and authenticity of the data from the smart meters. Any data anomaly between smart meters and concentrators can be detected, thus indicating potential compromise of concentrators.","","978-1-4799-8098-7","","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064626","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064626","","Ground penetrating radar;IEEE 802.15 Standards;IP networks;Logic gates;Zigbee","cryptographic protocols;data communication;smart meters;telecommunication security","AMI;advanced metering infrastructure;chameleon signatures;customer billing;delayed-integrity-verification;energy usage measurements;secure end-to-end data aggregation;trapdoor chameleon hash function","","0","","21","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are launched by malicious users whose only incentive is to degrade the performance of other, innocent, users. The traditional systems turn out to be quite vulnerable to these attacks. The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then use our vulnerability metric to evaluate a data structure which is commonly used in network mechanisms-the Hash table data structure. We show that Closed Hash is much more vulnerable to DDoS attacks than Open Hash, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent by traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queuing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems. Furthermore, we apply it to the practical case of a hash table whose requests are controlled by a queue, showing that even after the attack has ended, the regular users still suffer from performance degradation or even a total denial of service.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158635","Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Computer crime;DDoS;Data structures;Degradation;Measurement;Servers;hash;malicious;metric;queue;vulnerability","Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Computer crime;Data structures;Degradation;Measurement;Servers","Internet;computer network security;cryptography","DDoS attacks;Distributed Denial of Service attacks;Internet;closed hash;computer-network designs;hash table data structure;malicious users;network mechanism vulnerability;open hash;queuing mechanisms;vulnerability metric","","2","","26","","2012-02-27","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Security is a fundamental issue for these service networks due to the relevant business information handled in these networks. In this paper, we design and implement an efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism, called efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network (ELIDV) that aims to protect the network against three kinds of attacks: denial of service (DoS), integrity target, and false alert's generation. ELIDV is based on a set of rules that detects malicious vehicles promptly and with high accuracy. We present the performance analysis of our detection mechanism using NS-3 simulator. Our simulation results show that ELIDV exhibits a high-level security in terms of highly accurate detection rate (detection rate more than 97%), low false positive rate (close to 1%), and exhibits a lower overhead compared to contemporary frameworks.","2327-4662","","","10.1109/JIOT.2014.2366120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940213","Intrusion detection;Service Attacks;Service-oriented vehicular;intrusion detection;networks;service attacks;service-oriented vehicular networks","Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Road traffic;Service-oriented architecture;Vehiclular ad hoc networks;Wireless networks","computer network security;data communication;data integrity;intelligent transportation systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","DoS;ELIDV;ITS;NS-3 simulator;VANET;denial of service;efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network;false alert generation;high-rate data communication;integrity target;intelligent transportation system;low false positive rate;malicious detection;road-side units;service-oriented vehicular network;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless network","","0","","23","","2014-10-30","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key section of code injection attack is a small piece of code, called shellcode, which performs unauthorized operations when it is injected into software as part of valid data. On Windows CE, input data are often encoded using Unicode before being processed. In such cases, shellcode should be built in a way that bypasses such encoding; that is, it should be Unicode-proof. Unicode-proof shellcode also has great advantage of evading instruction detection system. However, it is quite difficult to build Unicode-proof shellcode for the ARM architecture, on which most embedded devices are developed, because the subset of instructions that can be used to write Unicode-proof shellcode is very limited. Moreover, the instruction cache in the ARM processor restricts the application of self-modifying code, which is frequently used in shellcode writing. This novel research proposes an approach to building ARM Unicode-proof shellcode on Windows CE under these constraints. The approach applies to all versions of ARM processors and Windows CE, including systems evolved from Windows CE, such as Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. The shellcode is tested on three currently available devices.","","978-1-61284-485-5","","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6013556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6013556","Unicode-proof;Windows CE;code injection","Architecture;Buildings;Computer architecture;Mobile communication;Registers;Security;Writing","invasive software;microprocessor chips;mobile handsets;operating systems (computers)","ARM architecture;ARM processor;Unicode-proof code injection attack;Unicode-proof shellcode;Windows CE;Windows Mobile;Windows Phone;embedded devices;instruction cache;instruction detection system;intrusion detection system;malware;mobile network;self-modifying code;shellcode writing;unauthorized operations","","1","","10","","","27-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

LARIAT allows researchers and operational users to rapidly configure and run real-time intrusion detection and correlation tests with robust background traffic and attacks in their laboratories. Second, “Scenario Datasets” have been crafted to provide examples of multiple component attack scenarios instead of the atomic attacks as found in past evaluations. Third, extensive analysis of the 1999 evaluation data and results has provided understanding of many attacks, their manifestations, and the features used to detect them. This analysis is used to develop models of attacks, intrusion detection systems, and intrusion detection system alerts.

We argue that such receptors incorporated as part of an anomaly detector enhance the detector's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous behaviour. In addition we propose that Toll-Like Receptors enable the classification of detected anomalies based on the types of attacks that perpetrate the anomalous behaviour. Classification of such type is either missing in existing literature or is not fit for the purpose of reducing the burden of an administrator of an intrusion detection system.

We show how the system is immune to malicious attacks that adjust transmitted signal strengths in attempts to circumvent the intrusion detection algorithms. We compare our results with earlier work that utilized static position information as a means for intrusion detection, showing how verification errors determined via tracking can be an order of magnitude smaller. Contrary to the static case, we also show how position verification via tracking is viable in the case where only one access point is within range of the mobile device.

In most cases they are not identified in requirements and are not continuously monitored during software evolution. Therefore, the inability of a system to conform to regulations or its endangerment by new vulnerabilities is not recognized. In consequence, decisions related to security might not be taken at all or become obsolete quickly. But to evaluate efficiently whether an issue is already addressed appropriately, software engineers need explicit decision documentation. Often, such documentation is not performed due to high overhead. To cope with this problem, we propose to document decisions made to address security requirements. To lower the manual effort, information from heuristic analysis and end user monitoring is incorporated. The heuristic assessment method is used to identify security issues in given requirements automatically. This helps to uncover security decisions needed to mitigate those issues. We describe how the corresponding security knowledge for each issue can be incorporated into the decision documentation semiautomatically. In addition, violations of security requirements at runtime are monitored. We show how decisions related to those security requirements can be identified through the documentation and updated manually. Overall, our approach improves the quality and completeness of security decision documentation to support the engineering and evolution of security requirements.","","","","10.1109/ESPRE.2014.6890520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890520","Security requirements engineering;decision documentation;decision knowledge;heuristic analysis;knowledge carrying software;software evolution;user mon-itoring","Context;Documentation;IEEE Potentials;Knowledge engineering;Monitoring;Security;Software","formal specification;security of data;system documentation","end user monitoring;heuristic analysis;heuristic assessment method;organization;security decision documentation;security decisions;security issues;security knowledge;semiautomatic security requirements engineering;software engineers;software evolution;vulnerability","","0","","18","","","25-25 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Wireless networks are susceptible to many attacks like Black Hole Attacks, Gray Hole Attacks, Worm Hole Attacks, Sink Hole, Sleep Deprivation Torture, Sybil Attack etc. These Networks needs to be protected using firewalls, encryption software, network failure detection schemes for detecting the attacks and minimizing their effects. Many of these schemes designed so far are not absolute and require more supporting systems. Therefore an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) is important to identify the malicious nodes, isolate the problem created by such nodes and notify the information of the malicious node to the other nodes. The ultimate aim of these schemes is to provide the necessary security cover to the network by adding encryption to maintain confidentiality and integrity. In this paper, we introduce a novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and examine the performance of the network by introducing. Black Hole Attack and Gray Hole Attack.

To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

This is due to the ability of active worms to propagate in an automated fashion as they continuously compromise computers on the Internet. Active worms evolve during their propagation, and thus, pose great challenges to defend against them. In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, referred to as Camouflaging Worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm is different from traditional worms because of its ability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time. Thereby, the C-Worm camouflages its propagation from existing worm detection systems based on analyzing the propagation traffic generated by worms. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and nonworm traffic (background traffic). We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain. However, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the Power Spectral Density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from background traffic. Using a comprehensive set of detection metrics and real-world traces as background traffic, we conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed spectrum-based detection scheme. The performance data clearly demonstrates that our scheme can effectively detect the C-Worm propagation. Furthermore, we show the generality of our spectrum-based scheme in effectively detecting not only the C-Worm, but traditional worms as well.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444887","Worm;anomaly detection.;camouflage","Computer networks;Computer worms;Density measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Internet;Large-scale systems;Power measurement;Recruitment;Telecommunication traffic;Volume measurement","Internet;invasive software","C-Worm propagation detection;Internet;active worms;background traffic;camouflaging worm detection;camouflaging worm modeling;nonworm traffic;power spectral density distribution;propagation traffic;security threats;spectral flatness measure;spectrum-based scheme","","7","","65","","2010-04-08","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present an approach for detecting worms based on similar patterns of connection activity. We then investigate how to improve the computational efficiency of worm detection by presenting a greedy algorithm, which minimizes the amount of traffic processing needed to detect worms, thus increasing the scalability of the system. Our evaluation shows that the greedy algorithm not only achieved high detection accuracy and reduced the amount of processing time to detect worms, but also achieved reasonable worm traffic detection in the early stages of an outbreak.","","0-7803-9087-3","","10.1109/INM.2005.1440779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440779","","Computational efficiency;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Computer worms;Greedy algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;greedy algorithms;invasive software;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet worm;anomaly detection;greedy algorithm;network intrusion detection;network security;worm traffic detection","","3","","18","","","15-19 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the DOS attack evolves the cross-correlations rise thus revealing the attack. CIDS relies on changes in correlation magnitude upon shifting from normal to attack conditions, thus it is an anomaly type intrusion detection system (IDS). However it is characterized by several advantages over anomaly IDS, primarily due to the fact that it greatly reduces and/or eliminates the need to maintain normal reference profiles. Thus CIDS (1) is algorithmically simple; (2) consumes less computational and storage resources; (3) is faster in execution; (4) promises to be more robust; and, (5) is conceptually simple, thus promises to be easier to maintain. By detecting abnormal conditions, CIDS also promises to detect novel as well as known attacks, an important advantage over signature based systems. Moreover, it achieves satisfactory misclassification rates, as demonstrated by the application of the scheme to the DARPA'98 corpus of intrusion attacks, namely false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates of 0 and 0.0605, respectively, and overall missclassification rate of 0.0011.","","0-7803-8219-6","","10.1109/SARNOF.2004.1302842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302842","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Equations;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","authorisation;computer network management;correlation methods","CIDS;Correlation Intrusion Detection System;DARPA'98 corpus;DoS attacks;anomaly type IDS;computer network;denial-of-service attacks;false negative rates;false positive rates;feature cross-correlation;intrusion detection system;misclassification rates;novel attacks","","2","","3","","","26-27 Apr 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Advancements in thin devices such as smart phone like windows phone or Google Android phones has a key factor to glue on network access service. The most amazing fact is that conventional TCP/IP model has driven all the services to the end user with some valuable enrichment on it. The key metrics play an important role to keep the information intact-Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA). Intrusion detection system prevents unauthorized access of computer without giving permission and detection helps to us to determine whether or not someone attempted to break into our system. In this paper we present an enhanced Agent Based [1-2] security model to discover unknown attacks or intrusion. Proposed system works in dual mode, network and host. In network model the real time traffic behavior (flows /attribute) has captured from the network while in host mode the user logs and user activity has been checked and monitored from. Attributes collected from both the mode, i.e. Network as well as host traffic with respect to the time as well as acknowledgment of protocol. In Proposed ""Agent Based Intrusion Detection System"" (ABIDS) has designed five types of agents to shield from both side (Host and Network). Agents are works in distributed manner to and communicate with each other to check the abnormality (suspicious) of the incoming traffic or logs via ACL.","","978-1-4799-3069-2","","10.1109/CSNT.2014.144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821486","ACL;Agent;DoS;IDPS;IDS;IPS;Intrusion Detection;JADE;MAS;Network security: Layers Attacks","Communication systems","computer network security;multi-agent systems;software agents;transport protocols","ABIDS;CIA metrics;Google Android phones;Internet protocol;TCP/IP model;Windows phone;agent based intrusion detection system;agent based security model;communication technology;confidentiality-integrity-availability metrics;information technology;smart phone;traffic behavior;transport control protocol;user activity;user logs","","1","","10","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is difficult to correctly distinguish the legitimate burst flow and the DDoS attacks by using the unilateral flow to analyze and detect the anomaly flow, so we propose a bidirectional-based DDoS detection mechanism. The detection mechanism put forward a state model which includes eight kinds of nodes by analyzing the input and output flow of the network nodes and the relationship between the input and output flow. Through the further analysis of the state model, we can distinguish the abnormal flow and the legitimate burst flow. The detection mechanism plays a timely role in early warning and prevention. The simulation results show that the bidirectional-based DDoS detection mechanism is effective and feasible.","","978-1-4244-3692-7","978-1-4244-3693-4","10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302259","","Bandwidth;Chaos;Computer crime;Computerized monitoring;Electronic mail;IP networks;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Transport protocols;Web and internet services","Internet;security of data","Internet;anomaly detection;bidirectional flow;bidirectional-based DDoS detection mechanism;normal bandwidth services","","0","","8","","","24-26 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","0","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, with the significant development of network technologies, the current IDS architecture does not support high-speed communications. Therefore, improving the performance of IDS is a major concern for researchers. In this paper, we present a model of intrusion detection based on the classification of network connections. Our approach is based on the principle of an intelligent loss. We propose a classification model based on the principle that a connection is either malicious or not. In the first case, the connection must be handled by the IDS; otherwise we can ignore it. This method reduces significantly the network flow sent to the IDS with a tolerance of an error threshold. This threshold can be adjusted by the updating process of the classification model.","","978-1-4244-6726-6","","10.1109/ICIMP.2010.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476902","classification;filtering;high-speed intrusion detection;learning","Degradation;Delay;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","pattern classification;security of data","IDS architecture;error threshold tolerance;high-speed networks;intelligent loss principle;intrusion detection systems;network connection classification","","1","","18","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are used for the detection of intrusive and malicious traffic in computer networks. Signature based IDS have been the most accurate among the available NIDS. But this accuracy is achieved at a cost of intensive computational power and inability to detect exploits whose signatures do not exist in the database. Statistical based IDS present a way to overcome these drawbacks with a compromise over accuracy. The key to the accuracy of the Statistical IDS lies in the classification algorithm adopted and the training data set used. This work presents a comparison of different classifier adopted for Statistical IDS.

In response, defenders have deployed cyber sensors in order to gain visibility into both network and host activities. However, the data generated by these sensors must be correlated to identify individual attacks. This is currently a highly manual process. Unfortunately, this approach does not scale as the number of endpoints increases, the number of networks grow, and limited skilled human analysts. Current state of the art analytic techniques have been developed to aid the human analyst in the association of sensor alerts to cyber attacks. However, these analytic systems require association decisions to be irrevocably made at the time of association. Our approach is to extend the multiple hypothesis tracking framework, from the standard kinematic domain, to the cyber domain. Combining the multiple hypothesis tracking framework with cyber association analytics will allow the formation of more accurate cyber attack tracks, reducing the computational burden currently residing on the human.","","978-1-4577-0267-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5977647","Attack Correlation;Cyber Tracking;Multiple Hypothesis Tracking","Correlation;IP networks;Kinematics;Radar tracking;Sensors;Target tracking;Weight measurement","security of data;sensor fusion","cyber association analytics;cyber attack tracks;multiple hypothesis tracking","","1","","12","","","5-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409","Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput","content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures","TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces","","0","","37","","2013-07-22","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the harshness, anomaly events such as adversarial intrusions may result in harmful and disastrous situations for industrial applications but it is difficult to detect them over wireless medium. Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing.
