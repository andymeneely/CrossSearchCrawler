To accurately assess the security of computer network systems, one must understand how vulnerabilities can be combined to stage an attack. Attack graphs are important tools for analyzing security vulnerabilities in enterprise networks. However, the complexity of traditional method for generating attack graphs increases dramatically as the network size grows. To solve this problem, the efficiency of attack graph generation method must be improved. Based on the analysis of generation approaches to attack graphs, an attack graph generation method for complex network is proposed in this paper. In this method, the network framework and key nodes can be analyzed and searched by loopholes scanning firstly. Then, starting from these key nodes, the algorithm which combined greedy policy, forward exploration and backward searching is used to generate the attack graph. Experimental results prove that the model can make a comprehensive analysis on network security and research the estimation of network attack.","","978-1-4673-5034-1","","10.1109/IMCCC.2012.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6428882","attack graph;backward searching;complex network;forward exploration;greedy policy;loopholes scanning","Complex networks;Computers;Databases;Instruments;Ports (Computers);Security;Servers","computational complexity;computer network security;graph theory","attack graph generation method;attack graph model;complex network security analysis;computer network systems;computer systems;enterprise networks;loopholes scanning;network attack;security vulnerabilities","","0","","10","","","8-10 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to secure computer networks. However, IDS may generate a huge volume of alerts, making it hard for security administrators to uncover hidden attack scenarios. In this paper, we propose a description logic-based approach for IDS event semantic analysis, which allows inferring attack scenarios and enabling the attack knowledge semantic queries. With an attack knowledge base consisting of Abox and Tbox, IDS alerts are converted into machine-understandable uniform alert streams. The ontology and attack instances of the attack knowledge base are applied to derive attack scenarios. Then the attack semantic query is implemented by the spreading activation technique, which enables administrators to query the intrusion states of the networks","","0-7803-8854-2","","10.1109/SARNOF.2005.1426503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1426503","","Computer network management;Computer security;Data security;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge representation;Logic;Ontologies;Wide area networks","computer network management;information management;security of data;telecommunication security","Abox;DDoS attacks;IDS event semantic analysis;Tbox;attack knowledge base;computer networks;description logic;intrusion detection systems;intrusion state querying;machine-understandable uniform alert streams;network distributed denial of service;network security management;ontology;security information management;spreading activation technique","","0","","11","","","18-19 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As network security has become a growing concern, system administrators lock down their networks by blocking traffic through certain ports and allowing traffic via only selected authorized ports such as HTTP. A recent survey has indicated that around 80 percent of attacks originate in the application layer. In this paper, a framework has been proposed to detect complex application level attacks that easily eludes packet level inspection solution. The proposed method enhances detection capability by performing application-level protocol analysis using semantic classification tree technique. The protocol analysis method extracts only specific fields of the protocol thereby providing significant search space reduction.

A Zebu specification, based on the notation used in RFCs, describes protocol message formats and related processing constraints. Zebu-based applications are efficient, since message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Zebu-based applications are also robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation of the message structure.

One way to deal with this problem is to filter unwanted traffic at the routers based on source IP addresses. Because of the limited number of available filters in the routers today, aggregation is used in practice: a single filter describes and blocks an entire range of IP addresses. This results in blocking of all (unwanted and wanted) traffic generated from hosts with IP addresses in that range. In this paper, we develop a family of algorithms that, given a blacklist containing the source IP addresses of unwanted traffic and a constraint on the number of filters, construct a set of filtering rules that optimize the tradeoff between the unwanted and legitimate traffic that is blocked. We show that our algorithms are optimal and also computationally efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that they are particularly beneficial when applied to realistic distributions of sources of unwanted traffic, which are known to exhibit spatial and temporal clustering.","","978-1-4244-2670-6","","10.1109/ITA.2008.4601049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601049","","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Constraint optimization;Filtering algorithms;Floods;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Jacobian matrices;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;filtering theory;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","Internet;distributed denial-of-service attacks;filtering sources;realistic distributions;routers based on source IP addresses;temporal clustering;unwanted traffic","","3","","11","","","Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multimatch classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAMs are expensive and consume large amounts of power. None of the previously published multimatch classification schemes are both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new set splitting algorithm (SSA). The main idea behind SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least 1/2 the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low-power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: multimatch using discriminators (MUD) (Lakshminarayanan and Rangarajan, 2005) and geometric intersection-based solutions (Yu and Katz, 2004). Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75%-95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with geometric intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet. We also show that SSA can be combined with SRAM/TCAM hybrid approaches to further reduce energy consumption","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2006.877134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705613","Energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Associative memory;Costs;Counting circuits;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Multiuser detection;Payloads;Random access memory;US Department of Commerce","content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication security","SNORT filter set;SSA;TCAM lookup;multimatch packet classification;network security application;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","11","","32","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Rather than using traditional techniques of attacking the technical shields such as firewalls, many sophisticated computer hackers find that social engineering is more effective and difficult to detect by humans. Why can people not effectively detect social engineering, or more specifically, the art of deception? What can be done to augment human abilities for the task? The current findings warrant several possibilities that influence human ability to detect deception. Factors include such things as truth-bias, stereotypical thinking and processing ability. Knowing that human detection ability is limited, we propose a method to automatically detect deception that potentially assists humans.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490","","Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The two most common implementations of Pattern matching are based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), which take the payload of a packet as an input string. In this paper, we propose an efficient NFA-based pattern matching in Binary Content Addressable Memory(BCAM), which uses data search words consisting of 1s and 0s. Our approach can process multiple characters at a time using limited BCAM entries, which makes our approach scalable well.

This new method can prune some redundant rules by using commonsense knowledge and the special rules without calculating confidence, so it improved the efficiency of mining and the utilization of discovered association rules.","","978-1-4244-7279-6","978-1-4244-7280-2","10.1109/ICICTA.2010.129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522795","Association Rule Mining;Commonsense Knowledge;Redundant Rules","Association rules;Automation;Character generation;Customer relationship management;Data analysis;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;Road accidents;Security","","","","0","","17","","","11-12 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 17th IEEE","20040712","2004","","","88","98","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become an important part of operational computer security. They are the last line of defense against malicious hackers and help detect ongoing attacks as well as mitigate their damage. However, intrusion detection systems are not turnkey solutions but are heavily dependent on expensive and scarce security experts for successful operation. By emphasizing self-learning algorithms, we can reduce dependence on the domain expert but instead require massive amounts of labeled training data, another scarce resource in intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate whether an active learning algorithm can perform on a par with a traditional self-learning algorithm in terms of detection accuracy but using significantly less labeled data. Our preliminary findings indicate that the active learning algorithm generally performs better than the traditional learning algorithm given the same amount of training data. Moreover, the reduction of labeled data needed can be as much as 80 times, shown by comparing an active learner with a traditional learner with similar detection accuracy. Thus, active learning algorithms seem promising in that they can reduce the dependence on security experts in the development of new detection rules by better leveraging the knowledge and time of the expert.","1063-6900","0-7695-2169-X","","10.1109/CSFW.2004.1310734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310734","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Counting circuits;Data mining;Data security;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Traffic control;Training data","expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","active learner;active learning;attack detection;detection accuracy;detection rules;expert knowledge;intrusion detection systems;labeled data;malicious hackers;operational computer security;security experts;self-learning algorithm;traditional learner;training data","","9","8","25","","","28-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large portion of scanning activity is of a slow scan type and is not currently detectable by security appliances. In this proof-of-concept study, a new scan detection technique is demonstrated that also improves our understanding of Internet traffic. Sessions are created using models of the behavior of packet-level data between host pairs, and activities are identified by grouping sessions based on patterns in the type of session, the IP addresses, and the ports. In a 24-h data set of nearly 10 million incoming sessions, a prodigious 78% were identified as scan probes. Of the scans, 80% were slower than basic detection methods can identify. To manage the large volume of scans, a prioritization method is introduced wherein scans are ranked based on whether a response was made and on the periodicity of the probes in the scan. The data is stored in an efficient manner, allowing activity information to be retained for very long periods of time. This technique provides insight into Internet traffic by classifying known activities, giving visibility to threats to the network through scan detection, while also extending awareness of the activities occurring on the network.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2109009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720528","Security and protection;system management;traffic analysis","Backscatter;Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Probes;Protocols;Sockets","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet traffic;activity information;malicious activity detection;network activity classification schema;packet-level data;periodicity;scan detection;scan probes;scanning activity;time 24 h","","9","","35","","2011-02-28","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These problems are emphasized when dealing with complex or parallel programs. This paper presents a new approach to automatically generate a dedicated and customized IDS from C sources targeting multi-threaded programs. We use Petri Nets to benefit from a formal description able to compactly describe parallel behaviors.

In this paper we describe a new protocol, named SAVE, that can provide routers with the information needed for source address validation. SAVE messages propagate valid source address information from the source location to all destinations, allowing each router along the way to build an incoming table that associates each incoming interface of the router with a set of valid source address blocks. This paper presents the protocol design and evaluates its correctness and performance by simulation experiments.

We employ an instance of change-point detection, non-parametric Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm, for SYN-flooding detection. It performs per-flow attack detection based on SYN and ACK packets exchanged in TCP friendly flow. A prototype of synmon embedded forwarder is developed and the performance of synmon under different attack patterns, network loads, sampling interval and tuning parameters is investigated.

We obtain that buffer size is approximately half the window size in networks with high bandwidth-delay product. Though these bounds are not new, the proofs are elegant in using simple differential equations. It is worthwhile to clarify that when maximum window size is comparatively smaller than bandwidth-delay product, F-TCP gains on average the same throughput as TCP with no loss when the round-trip time of each cycle is the same.

One of the major concerns of the development is its latency delay. Host-based IDS systems inspecting log files provided by operating systems or applications need more time to analyze log content. It demands a large number of computer resources, such as CPU time and memory. Besides, there still a crucial problem about how to transform human behavior into numbers so as measurement can be easily performed. In order to improve the problem addressed we promote IDS called host-based real time intrusion detection system (HRIDS). HRIDS monitors users' activities in a real-time aspect. By defining user profiles, we can easily find out the anomalies and malicious accesses instantly. With the help of user profiles, we cannot only find which account has been misused, but also realize the true intruders. There is no need to update the knowledge databases of HRIDS. It is a self-organized and self-training system. Furthermore, we discover cooperative attacks submitted by users at the same time by using data mining and forensic techniques.","","0-7803-7882-2","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297623","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297623","","Application software;Computer displays;Data mining;Delay;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Performance evaluation;Real time systems","computer crime;data mining;real-time systems;safety systems","data mining;forensic techniques;host-based real-time intrusion detection system;intelligent monitor;user profile","","0","","9","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols. Advantages and Disadvantages have also been described in existing techniques to carry out research in this problem.","","978-1-4577-1385-9","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075132","Attacks;DDoS;IP Spoofing;IP Traceback;Zombies","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Probabilistic logic","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDOS attacks;IP routing;IP spoofing;IP traceback;Internet connection;Internet security;compromised hosts;distributed denial-of-service;router functions;traceback techniques","","3","","22","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The novelty lies in the fact that a node can correctly validate who it is, but lie about its location and exploit this to create problems to the network. There are three main factors that make ad hoc networks more vulnerable: (a) nodes can overhear other nodes announcements, (b) nodes can lie about their location, and (c) nodes can avoid detection and isolation by moving. As a result, malicious nodes can fake their position and this way obstruct the routing. In this work, we explain how location and topology related malice can affect the security of wireless ad hoc networks. First, we present the most important attacks that can stem from misuse of location information. Second, we provide an overview of security routing approaches.

Hierarchical methods are more efficient for this. Apart from achieving energy efficiency, the load on balancing and security are essential. Security Aware Energy Balanced Hierarchical Protocol (SEBHP) builds a clustered hierarchical routing tree and minimizes the energy utilization by selecting efficient relay nodes and routing path and implements security by means of introducing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

In this paper, we start by an analysis of connection sojourn time distribution of network traffic. Based on this analysis, first we design a two level session table in order to avoid session table explosion.

IEEE","20060320","2005","","","1831","1837 Vol. 3","This paper addresses one aspect of the problem of defending mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) against computer attacks, namely, the development of a distributed anomaly-based intrusion detection system. In a general sense, the proposed system is a co-located sensor network, in which the monitored variable is the health of the network being monitored. A three level hierarchical system for data collection, processing and transmission is described. Local IDSs (intrusion detection systems) are attached to each node of the MANET, collecting raw data of network operation, and computing a local anomaly index measuring the difference between the current node operation and a baseline of normal operation. Anomaly indexes from nodes belonging to a cluster are periodically transmitted to a cluster head, which fuses the node indexes producing a cluster-level anomaly index. Likewise, cluster heads periodically transmit these cluster-level anomaly indexes to a manager node, which fuses the cluster-level indexes into a network-level anomaly index. Due to network mobility, cluster membership and cluster heads are time varying. The paper describes: (1) clustering algorithms to update cluster centers; (2) machine learning algorithms for computing the local anomaly indexes; (3) a statistical scheme for fusing the anomaly indexes at the cluster heads and at the manager. The statistical scheme is formally shown to increase detection accuracy under idealized assumptions. These algorithms were implemented and tested under the following conditions. Routing schemes: AODV (ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing) and OLSR (optimized link state routing); mobility patterns: random walk mobility model and reference point group mobility at various speeds; types of attacks: traffic flooding denial-of-service and black hole. For performance evaluation we determined the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) for various operational conditions at the nodes, cluster heads and manager. The overall res- - ults confirm the effectiveness of the infrastructures and algorithms described in the paper, with detection accuracy generally improving as we move up in the hierarchy, i.e. detection accuracy at the cluster level is higher than at local level, while network-level detection outperforms cluster-level detection","","0-7803-9393-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605939","","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic heads;Mobile computing;Routing","ad hoc networks;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services;wireless sensor networks","(optimized link state routing;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;black hole;cluster head;cluster membership;cluster-level anomaly index;colocated sensor network;computer attacks;data collection;data processing;data transmission;distributed anomaly;intrusion detection;local anomaly indexes;machine learning algorithms;mobile ad-hoc networks;mobility patterns;network mobility;random walk mobility model;receiver operating characteristics;reference point group mobility;statistical scheme;three level hierarchical system;traffic flooding denial-of-service","","9","","21","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","","978-1-4244-1588-5","978-1-4244-1588-5","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","12","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on these, we first propose a novel data mining scheme for network anomaly detection in this paper. Moreover, we adopt data reduction mechanisms (including genetic algorithm (GA) based instance selection and filter based feature selection methods) to boost the detection performance, meanwhile reduce the computational cost of TCM-KNN. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate the proposed method can effectively detect anomalies with high detection rates, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, the data reduction mechanisms would greatly improve the performance of TCM-KNN and make it be a good candidate for anomaly detection in practice.","","1-4244-1304-4","1-4244-1304-4","10.1109/IAW.2007.381936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267564","Anomaly Detection;Data Reduction;Network Security;TCM-KNN Algorithm","Computational efficiency;Conferences;Costs;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Testing","data mining;data reduction;genetic algorithms;security of data;telecommunication security","computational cost;data mining scheme;data reduction mechanism;filter based feature selection methods;genetic algorithm;instance selection;network anomaly detection scheme","","2","","15","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first acted as a malware collector, a device usually deployed in order to capture self-propagating malware and monitor their activity. The second acted as a decoy server, dropping but logging every malicious connection attempt. Both of these systems have remained online for a lengthy period of time to study the aforementioned malicious activity. During this assessment it was shown that human attackers and malicious software are constantly attacking servers, trying to break into systems or spread across networks. It was also shown that the usage of honeypots for malware monitoring and attack logging can be very effective and provide valuable data.

In this paper, we address the intrusion detection problem in heterogeneous networks consisting of nodes with different noncorrelated security assets. In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment. We also show how our game theoretical framework can be applied to configure the intrusion detection strategies in realistic scenarios via a case study. Finally, we evaluate the proposed game theoretical framework via simulations.

This attacker-driven anti-malware testing is something defenders would ideally want to limit. Given that anti-malware products must be widely distributed to be commercially viable, it is not feasible to prevent attackers from running them. Here we examine whether it may be possible to instead limit the effectiveness of attacker tests. Specifically, we present a game-theoretic model of anti-malware testing where detection timeliness and coverage are parameters that can be adjusted by anti-malware providers. The less coverage and the slower the response, the harder it is for attackers to determine whether their malware will be detected-and the less protection the software provides to hosts running the anti-malware software. While our results are preliminary, they suggest that it is clearly non-optimal for anti-malware vendors to simply maximize coverage and detection time. As we explain, this result has significant implications for product design and (non-malicious) anti-malware testing methodologies.","","","","10.1109/WATeR.2014.7015755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015755","","Computers;Game theory;Games;Malware;Software;Testing","invasive software;product design","antimalware products;antimalware software;attacker-driven antimalware testing;detection coverage;detection timeliness;game-theoretic model;malware author testing challenge;product design","","0","","16","","","23-23 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various kinds of attack have been identified and corresponding solutions have been proposed. Wormhole attack is one of the serious attacks which forms a serious threat in the networks, especially against many ad hoc wireless routing protocols and location-based wireless security system. We identify two types of wormhole attacks. In the first type, malicious nodes do not take part in finding routes, meaning that, legitimate nodes do not know their existence. In the second type, malicious nodes do create route advertisements and legitimate nodes are aware of the existence of malicious nodes, just do not know they are malicious. Some researchers have proposed detection mechanisms for the first type. In this paper, we propose an efficient detection method called delay per hop indication (DelPHI). By observing the delays of different paths to the receiver, the sender is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. This method requires neither synchronized clocks nor special hardware equipped mobile nodes. The performance of DelPHI is justified by simulations.","","0-7803-9410-0","","10.1109/ISWPC.2006.1613586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613586","Ad Hoc;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole","Clocks;Communication system security;Data communication;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;data communication;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DelPHI;ad hoc wireless routing protocols;data transmission;delay per hop indication;location-based wireless security system;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc wireless networks;route advertisements;untrusted wireless environment;wormhole attacks;wormhole detection mechanism","","20","","14","","","16-18 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system collects data from application layer and network layer and classifies them using the log file data collected from these layers and local anomalies are computed using local agents finally it is sent to a global agent for integration. The local agents monitor the two layers of the network to determine the correlation among the observed anomalous patterns, reporting such abnormal behavior to the administrator for taking possible action. Our simulation results obtained after integration shows that it is possible to obtain high intrusion-detection rates (99.2%) and low false-alarm rates","","1-4244-0997-7","1-4244-0997-7","10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156679","Forecasting Adhoc Network;Intelligent Agents;Intrusion Detection System;OneR algorithm","Application software;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Testing;Variable speed drives","ad hoc networks;correlation methods;mobile agents;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","application layer;correlation theory;intelligent agent based approach;intrusion detection;log file data;mobile ad hoc network;network layer","","2","","4","","","22-24 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flow statistics are used to discover anomalies by aggregating network traces and then using machine-learning classifiers to discover suspicious activities. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of the flow classification models depends on the granularity of aggregation. This paper describes a novel approach that aggregates packets into network flows and correlates them with security events generated by payload-based IDSs for detection of cyber-attacks.","","978-1-4799-9888-3","","10.1109/ISI.2015.7165965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165965","Flow aggregation;Intrusion Detection;NetFlow;traffic classification","Correlation;Grippers;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Predictive models","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis","cyber-attack;machine-learning classifier;multigranular aggregation;network flow statistics;payload-based IDS;security analysis;security event","","0","","22","","","27-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a malware behavior extracting system is addressed. It used Intel VT to trace malware's runtime system calls and extracted maximal patterns to describe malware behavior. A pattern's extracting algorithm is proposed to extract maximal patterns from system calls sequence. Real-world malwares are used to validate this method. The results of experiments have shown that the method can describe the behavior of mal-program with strong resilience and high accuracy.","","978-1-4244-4909-5","","10.1109/ICISE.2009.725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5454576","","Computer applications;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Information science;Information security;Operating systems;Resilience;Software protection;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software","Intel VT;malware behavior extracting system;maximal patterns;runtime system","","0","","16","","","26-28 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the main form of blocking attacks launched by a small amount of attacker firstly. And then cite some of the major methods that deal with denial of service attacks from the three aspects of prevention, detection and tracking. After that, a new type of authentication method applied to a shared media network or broadcast network, based on the calculation of the amount, established a connection between the client and the server-side is proposed. Lastly we present a detailed analysis the method that greatly enhances the security of the server.","","978-1-4673-0721-5","","10.1109/CSSS.2012.207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394445","Authentication;Denial of Service (Dos) Attack;hash functions;passwords","Authentication;Certification;Computer crime;Protocols;Servers;Vectors","Internet;authorisation;computer network security;cryptography","DoS defense mechanism;Internet;authentication method;blocking-free shared-media terminal connection setup method;broadcast network;denial-of-service attacks;detection aspect;hash functions;prevention aspect;server security;shared media network;tracking aspect","","0","","9","","","11-13 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An analysis of correlations of intrusion alerts in an NREN","Bartos, V.; Zadnik, M.","Brno Univ. of Technol., Brno, Czech Republic","Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD), 2014 IEEE 19th International Workshop on","20150209","2014","","","305","309","An ever increasing impact and amount of network attacks have driven many organizations to deploy various network monitoring and analysis systems such as honeypots, intrusion detection systems, log analyzers and flow monitors. Besides improving these systems a logical next step is to collect and correlate alerts from multiple systems distributed across organizations. The idea is to leverage a joint effect of multiple monitoring systems to build a more robust and efficient system, ideally, lacking the shortcomings of the individual contributing systems. This paper presents an analysis of alert reports gathered from several such detectors deployed in national research and education network (NREN). The analysis focuses on the correlations of reported events in temporal domain as well as on the correlations of different event types.","","","","10.1109/CAMAD.2014.7033255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033255","","Correlation;Detectors;Educational institutions;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","computer network security","NREN;National Research And Education Network;alert report analysis;flow monitors;honeypots;intrusion alerts;intrusion detection systems;log analyzers;network analysis systems;network attacks;network monitoring systems","","0","","9","","","1-3 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
