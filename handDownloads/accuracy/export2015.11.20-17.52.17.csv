However, MANET is more vulnerable than wired networking. Existing security mechanisms designed for wired networks have to be redesigned in this new environment. In this paper, we discuss the problem of anomaly detection in MANET. The focus of our research is on techniques for automatically constructing anomaly detection models that are capable of detecting new or unseen attacks. We propose a new anomaly detection method for MANET. The proposed method performs cross-feature analysis on the basis of rough sets to capture the inter-feature correlation patterns in normal traffic. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation. The results show that proposed method effectively detects anomalies and identify attack types using the intrusion detection method.","","978-1-4244-2107-7","978-1-4244-2108-4","10.1109/WiCom.2008.1088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4678996","","Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;History;Information analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Rough sets;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;rough set theory;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;cross-feature analysis;inter-feature correlation patterns;intrusion detection;mobile ad-hoc networking;rough sets;security mechanisms","","0","","8","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite numerous technological innovations for information assurance, it is still very difficult to protect computer systems. Therefore, unwanted intrusions take place when the actual software systems are running. Different soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach to network intrusion detection, and the software implementation of the approach. The genetic algorithm is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data, and the support-confidence framework is utilized as fitness function to judge the quality of each rule. The generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing GA-based approaches, because of the simple representation of rules and the effective fitness function, the proposed method is easier to implement while providing the flexibility to either generally detect network intrusions or precisely classify the types of attacks. Experimental results show the achievement of acceptable detection rates based on benchmark DARPA data sets on intrusions, while no other complementary techniques or relevant heuristics are applied.","","0-7695-2294-7","","10.1109/SNPD-SAWN.2005.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434896","Information assurance;genetic algorithms;misuse intrusion detection;software development;support-confidence","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;genetic algorithms;security of data;software engineering","Internet;genetic algorithms;information assurance;misuse intrusion detection;network audit data;network intrusion detection;security threat;software development;support-confidence framework","","14","","17","","","23-25 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, we can determine whether we need to perform network or security operation. We apply clustering algorithm for AID and classification algorithm for MID. The nonlinear adaptive system is trained for running MID and AID in parallel. Proposed parallel system is more lightweight and simple to operate even if the number of incident patterns is increased. Experimental results in the case where false positive is frequently caused show that our method is functional with a recognition rate of attacks less than 10%, while finding the anomaly status.

We demonstrate that high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using Conditional Random Fields and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach. Experimental results on the benchmark KDD '99 intrusion data set show that our proposed system based on Layered Conditional Random Fields outperforms other well-known methods such as the decision trees and the naive Bayes. The improvement in attack detection accuracy is very high, particularly, for the U2R attacks (34.8 percent improvement) and the R2L attacks (34.5 percent improvement).

Our NEA evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a Lindenmayer System with memory that implements the principles of organization, modularity, repetition (multiple use of the same sub-structure), hierarchy (recursive composition of sub-structures), as a metaphor for development of neurons and its connections. In our method, this basic neural codification is integrated to a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that implements the constructive approach found in the evolutionary process, making it closest to the biological ones.

In this paper, we formulate the problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as ""predictive blacklisting"") based on shared attack logs, as an implicit recommendation system. We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for prediction and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement. Inspired by the recent NetFlix competition, we propose a multi-level collaborative filtering model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting problem.

In such type of specification driven machine control systems there is a great opportunity for high level pre-deployment analysis based on the information about the characteristics of the system that inherently exist in the specification files that drive them, with extra specifications, based on the kind and domain of analysis one is interested in. This provides a great opportunity for analysis of system specifications before deployment, that can help to figure out whether they are correct or not. One such application that we found in this context is of analyzing the networking behavior of an application based on its specification. In this paper we present a Conceptual Framework for Pre Deployment Network Analysis of Specification driven Monitoring and Control system and prototype implementation of a tool that does a high level network analysis of a hypothetical specification based system based on GMRT system. The paper also describes the specification files which contain network and expert (usage context) specifications that are necessary for such an analysis.","","978-1-4673-1937-9","","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297148","network analysis;specification based systems;specifications","Argon;Bandwidth;Delay;Monitoring;TV","computerised monitoring;control engineering computing;data acquisition;formal specification;radioastronomy;radiotelescopes","GMRT system;application-system behavioral aspects;auxiliary information;conceptual framework;data acquisition;expert specifications;giant meter wave radio telescope;high level network analysis;hypothetical specification based system;model driven development;network specifications;networking behavior analysis;predeployment network analysis;radio astronomical research;specification driven machine control systems;state machine descriptions;validation checks","","0","","10","","","12-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE GLOBECOM 2008. IEEE","20081208","2008","","","1","5","Detecting spreaders can help an intrusion detection system identify potential attackers. The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181","","Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","SRAM chips;security of data","SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint","","0","","12","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, for the low frequency subband coefficients, we present a fusion rule based on the local entropy; while for the high frequency subband coefficients, a fusion rule based on the directional contrast combined with the local area energy is applied.

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4577-1704-8","978-1-4577-1702-4","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","11","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis.

In this article, a multi-layer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system is designed and developed to achieve high efficiency and improve the detection and classification rate accuracy inspired by immune systems with negative selection approach. In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers. The obtained results demonstrated that naive bayes classifier has better classification accuracy in the case of lower presented attacks such as U2R and R2L, while the J48 decision tree classifier gives high accuracy up to 82% for DoS attacks and 65.4% for probe attacks in the anomaly traffic.","","978-1-4799-2438-7","","10.1109/HIS.2013.6920485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920485","Artificial Immune System;Intrusion Classification;Machine Learning;Network Intrusion Detection","Niobium;Probes","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;principal component analysis;telecommunication traffic","DoS attacks;IDS;J48 decision tree classifier;NSL-KDD benchmark data set;PCA algorithm;R2L;U2R;anomalies detection;anomalous traffic;anomaly detectors;classification approach;feature selection;genetic algorithm;immune systems;multilayer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron neural network;naive Bayes classifier;negative selection approach;normal traffic;principal component analysis algorithm;probe attacks","","1","","25","","","4-6 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second International Conference on","20080307","2007","","","377","381","Current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) often trigger a large amount of alerts, most of which are redundant alerts and false positives. Consequently, it is difficult for administrators to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. Several alert correlation methods have been proposed. However, these methods don't consider the differences in reliability among alerts reported from multiple IDSs. This paper presents a novel alert correlation approach based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which regards the alerts as evidence of network attack and combines all the evidence according to the Dempster's combination rule, inferring whether the attack has taken place. The main advantage of the approach is that it can eliminate the ambiguity and confliction in alerts and reduce the number of alerts. With the DARPA 2000 test dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the approach can reduce more than 69% of reported alerts and decrease the false positive rate efficiently.","","978-1-4244-1009-5","978-1-4244-1009-5","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469406","D-S evidence theory;alert correlation;intrsion detection system;network security","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Correlation;Data security;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protection;Testing","computer networks;correlation methods;security of data;telecommunication security","Dempste combination rule;Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;intrusion alert correlation method;intrusion detection systems;network attack","","3","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the features selection is an important issue in intrusion detection. Reducing the features set improves the system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing phases considerably. In this paper, we improve the Enhancing Support Vector Decision Function (ESVDF) approach by integrate it with a fuzzy inferencing model. The fuzzy inferencing model is used to accommodate the learning approximation and the small differences in the decision making steps of the ESVDF approach. It simplifies the design complexity and reduces the execution time of the ESVDF, which speeds up the features selection processing and facilitates any modification or changes in the features selection process that may happen later. In addition, it improves the overall performance of the ESVDF. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can deliver a satisfactory performance in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing time.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-4000-9","978-0-7695-3638-5","10.1109/AINA.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076245","","Computer networks;Computer vision;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","approximation theory;decision making;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","decision making;enhancing support vector decision function;feature set reduction;features selection;fuzzy ESVDF approach;fuzzy inference model;intrusion detection system;machine learning approximation;testing phase;training phase","","3","","28","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first vital step in dealing with this problem is the network's ability to detect such attacks. To that end, it is important that an intrusion detection mechanism be able to differentiate between real DDoS traffic and Flash Crowds traffic, the latter of which constitutes sudden bursts of legitimate network activity. To train and analyze detection mechanisms, researchers typically simulate the DDoS traffic in the testbed; while for Flash Crowds, most researchers replay the web server captures obtained from third parties. This paper proposes the design of a special testbed-based simulation method with Spirent Test Center hardware platform, to simulate both DDoS traffic and Flash Crowds traffic.

In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations.

We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized. We then apply the analysis results obtained to the design of a dynamic redundancy management algorithm to identify and apply the best design parameter settings at runtime in response to environment changes, to maximize the HWSN lifetime.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.043013.120282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514999","Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;intrusion detection;multipath routing;reliability;security","Energy conservation;Intrusion detection;Multipath channels;Network sensors;Routing protocls;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor management","energy consumption;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","HWSN;dynamic redundancy management algorithm;energy consumption;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intrusion tolerance;multipath routing;optimization problem;query response success probability;security;voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm","","4","","40","","2013-05-13","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient IDS by selecting relevant futures from NSL-KDD dataset and using Logistic Regression (LR) based classifier. To decrease memory space and learning time, a feature selection method is required. In this paper we have selected a number of feature sets, using the approach of Genetic Algorithm (GA), with our proposed fitness score based on Mutual Correlation. From the number of feature sets, we have selected the fittest set of features using our proposed Best Feature Set Selection (BFSS) method. After selecting the most relevant features from NSL-KDD data set, we used LR based classification.

Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities. We define criteria and analyse these variations with complexity (time and space) and output to the original DBSCAN algorithm.

Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4","","10.1109/IPSN.2006.244130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months.

One of the widely used technique for anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDS) is cluster analysis. In cluster based IDS, feature vectors generated from network traffic are grouped into clusters as normal or abnormal (raising alert). The main cause for false alert generation is either, technique fails to differentiate an outlier from a genuine cluster point or the features extracted fail to separate the two classes. In this work, fuzzy clustering technique for anomaly intrusion detection has been explored to reduce the false alarms. A technique to robustify the existing fuzzy c-means algorithm is proposed and subsequently used as anomaly IDS.","","978-2-9532-4431-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5161662","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Feature extraction;Fuzzy systems;Intrusion detection;Prototypes;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis","anomaly network intrusion detection;cluster analysis;feature vector;fuzzy c-means algorithm;fuzzy clustering technique;fuzzy mega cluster;network traffic","","0","","14","","","24-26 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With booming number of intruders and hackers in todays vast and sophisticated computerized world, it is unceasingly challenging to identify unknown attacks in promising time with no false positive and no false negative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm. Obtained results demonstrates detection accuracy, computational efficiency with minimal false alarms, less system resources utilization. Experimental results are compared with respect to detection rate and detection time and found that TREE classification algorithms achieved superior results over other algorithms.

We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g and Bloom-Q, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller or comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the “big-dataism”. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources.

In this paper, feature selection techniques based on Gain ratio attribute, Correlation feature selection, Chi Squared attribute, Consistency subset, Filtered attribute, Filtered subset, Information gain attribute, One RA attribute and Symmetrical Uncert attribute evaluation are tested on three classifiers (Naïve Bayes, J48 and PART) by using Weka data mining and machine learning tool on UCI KDD CUP 1999 network traffic dataset. The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features. Hence it is proposed that reduced number of features should be used in IDS for the quick detection of threats.","","","","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918792","Classification;Data Pre-processing;Feature Selection;Malware Detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Filtering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;feature selection;invasive software","FP rate;IDS;RA attribute;TP rate;UCI KDD CUP;Weka data mining;chi squared attribute;consistency subset;correlation feature selection;feature selection techniques;filtered attribute;filtered subset evaluation;gain ratio attribute;information gain attribute;intrusion detection system;machine learning tool;malware detection;network traffic dataset","","0","","21","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To devise effective countermeasures, it is crucial to know how attacks on these systems are performed in reality. In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed monitoring system with Sensor nodes located in Norway, Germany and China that allow to detect SIP-based attacks from the Internet. Based on experiences from experiments spanning several years, we propose a new setup which allows simple and straightforward addition of new remote observation points. We have deployed this setup in the NorNet testbed and highlight its advantages compared to a previous setup with physically distributed Sensors. We also present results from a 45 day field test with 13 observation points.

We show that these measures can be fused and generalized into a generic feature-selection (GeFS) measure. Further on, we propose a new feature-selection method that ensures globally optimal feature sets. The new approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming problem (M01LP) by using the branchand-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear (O(n)) in the number n of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our GeFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application. Experimental results obtained over the KDD Cup '99 test data set for IDS show that the GeFS measure removes 93% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set, while keeping or yielding an even better classification accuracy.","1051-4651","978-1-4244-7542-1","","10.1109/ICPR.2010.378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5597038","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Polynomials","linear programming;pattern recognition;security of data;tree searching","branchand-bound algorithm;correlation-feature-selection measure;filter model;generic feature-selection measure;in-depth analysis;intrusion detection system;minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance measure;mixed 0-1 linear programming problem;optimal feature set;pattern recognition","","6","","7","","","23-26 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy. As a result of finding imperfect self-region radius we have faced weak detectors that couldn't recognize anomaly perfectly.

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, most deployments over UDP, limited use of message encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level. To mitigate this, self-learning systems have been proposed to counteract new threats. However the efficacy of existing machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Existing literature indicates that Euclidean distance based classifiers work well to detect anomalous messages. Our work suggests that such classifiers do not produce adequate results for well-crafted malicious messages that differ very slightly from normal messages. To demonstrate this, we gather SIP traffic and minimally perturb it using 13 generic transforms to create malicious SIP messages. We use the Levenshtein distance, L, as a measure of similarity between normal and malicious SIP messages. We subject our dataset - consisting of malicious and normal SIP messages - to Euclidean distance-based classifiers as well as four standard classifiers. Our results show vast differences for Euclidean distance-based classifiers on our dataset than reported in current literature. We further see that the standard classifiers are better able to classify an anomalous message when L is small.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990708","","Fires;Grammar;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Routing protocols","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);signalling protocols;telecommunication traffic","ASCII message representation;Euclidean classifiers;Internet;Levenshtein distance;SIP messages;UDP;anomalous message detection;machine learning algorithms;message encryption;multimedia session establishment protocol;self-learning systems;self-similar session initiation protocol","","3","","17","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Enhanced side-channel analysis method to detect hardware virtualization based rootkits","Kyte, I.; Zavarsky, P.; Lindskog, D.; Ruhl, R.","Wurldtech Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Internet Security (WorldCIS), 2012 World Congress on","20120823","2012","","","192","201","This paper describes a method of detecting hardware virtualization based rootkits by performance benchmarking by detecting performance degradation caused by the hardware virtualization itself. The method proposed is both passive and remote, so it is not easily detected by the rootkit. The method does not rely on an internal and therefore untrustable timing source, and does not rely on the rootkit's potentially imperfect representation of the actual physical characteristics of the computing platform. For these reasons, it is believed that this method is not subject to criticisms normally leveled against the currently proposed methods of detecting hardware virtualization or hardware virtualization rootkits. Measuring performance degradation requires a baseline, and compared with that baseline, the degradation must be sufficiently great to be judged anomalous with reasonable confidence. That degradation must also be accurately measurable by a trusted and therefore external timing source. Accordingly, the benchmarking experiment that has been devised was performed using commodity hardware and freely available software, to determine which resources virtualization seems to degrade performance most significantly, and of these resources, which are most accurately timed externally. Although the results are preliminary, and strictly speaking, apply only to the actual hardware used in the experiment, they nonetheless show that there is potential to use passive network analysis to detect hardware based virtualization rootkits and associated malware.","","978-1-4673-1108-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280227","enhanced side-channel analysis;performance benchmarking;rootkit detection","Benchmark testing;Computers;Hardware;Malware;Timing;Virtual machine monitors","benchmark testing;invasive software;virtualisation","commodity hardware;freely available software;hardware virtualization;malware;performance benchmarking;performance degradation;rootkits;side-channel analysis method","","0","","21","","","10-12 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Building effective IDSs, unfortunately, has remained an elusive goal owing to the great technical challenges involved; and applied AI techniques are increasingly being utilized in attempts to overcome the difficulties. This paper presents a comparative study of using support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and linear genetic programs (LGPs) for intrusion detection. We investigate and compare the performance of IDSs based on the mentioned techniques, with respect to a well-known set of intrusion evaluation data gathered by Lincoln Labs. Through a variety of experiments and analysis, it is found that, with appropriately chosen population size, program size, crossover rate and mutation rate, LGPs outperform other techniques in terms of detection accuracy at the expense of time. SVMs outperform MARS and ANNs in three critical aspects of intrusion detection: accuracy, training time, and testing time.","1082-3409","0-7695-2038-3","","10.1109/TAI.2003.1250243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250243","","Artificial intelligence;Computer networks;Computer security;Control systems;Intrusion detection;Mars;Physics computing;Protection;Support vector machines;Terrorism","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;genetic algorithms;neural nets;safety systems;splines (mathematics);support vector machines","ANN;IDS;Lincoln Labs;MARS;SVM;artifical neural network;artificial intelligence;cyber attack;cyber security;cyber terrorism;information security;intrusion detection;intrusion evaluation data;linear genetic program;multivariate adaptive regression splines;network computer;physical security;support vector machine","","13","","26","","","3-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the IANA pool of IPv4 addresses has run out, IPv6 will become increasingly important. Although the IPv6 protocol stack presents considerable advantages compared with the IPv4 protocol stack, IP source address spoofing is still exploited in IPv6 to initiate malicious attacks. Some techniques are proposed and deployed to implement source address validation at fine granularity. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of fine granularity IP source address validation, e.g. whether filtering technology is deployed to prevent hosts from using forged IP address. We develop a detection tool with controlled spoofing ability which can infer whether the function of filtering spoofing address packets is enabled. We run this tool in 12 famous universities in China and collect the testing data. We gather a total of 41373 probes from 324 clients, and each probe includes sending at least 5 packets with the same spoofing source address to the control server. Results reveal that, 77.02% of the spoofing probes are completely filtered, 0.29% of the spoofing probes are partly filtered and the rest spoofing probes are not filtered at all. Overall, this illustrates that techniques of source address validation have been widely deployed in campus networks. Our statistical results provide practical basis for the deployment and further development of source address validation protocols in IPv6 networks.","","978-1-4577-1668-3","","10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077038","IPV6;efficiency;fine granularity;source address validation;spoofing","Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Wireless networks","IP networks;computer network security;protocols","IANA pool;IPv4 addresses;IPv6 protocol;detection tool;fine granularity;malicious attacks;source address validation;spoofing address packet filtering","","1","","20","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed model in the term of error equal rate.","","978-1-4799-0078-7","","10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707175","Anomaly detection;Database intrusion detection;Database security;Role-based profiling","Data structures;Database systems;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Vectors","Bayes methods;SQL;authorisation;pattern classification;query processing","IDS;NBC;RBAC database system;anomaly detection approach;compact data structure;error equal rate;hexplet;intrusion detection systems;naive Bayes classifier;normal database access behavior;raw transactional SQL queries;role administrated database;role-based access control database system;transaction-based approach;transaction-log entry;valuable information resources","","0","","20","","","26-28 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence, attackers are potentially able to impersonate legitimate Wi-Fi network nodes, including both clients and access points, by generating network traffic with all the characteristics of legitimate traffic. To exclusively discriminate illegitimate nodes, we propose a method of using multiple and multiple-angle measurements of a Wi-Fi network nodepsilas signal strength. In this paper we present a real time unsupervised analysis method for identifying duplicate Wi-Fi network nodes which are physically separate. We demonstrate that, given a dense sensor network, data from a small set of identifiable critical sensors are much more valuable in node discrimination than those from other sensors, enabling large improvement in responding speed and discrimination accuracy.","","978-0-7695-3455-8","978-0-7695-3455-8","10.1109/NWeSP.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4700397","Information Retrieval;Security","Data security;Ethernet networks;Monitoring;Next generation networking;Protocols;Strontium;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Web services;Wireless LAN","telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","dense sensor network;duplicate Wi-Fi network identification;legitimate traffic;multiple-angle measurement;network traffic;real time unsupervised analysis method;telecommunication security","","1","","17","","","20-22 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To render networks more secure, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) aim to recognize attacks within constraints of two major performance considerations: high detection and low false-alarm rates. It is also not enough to detect already-known intrusions, yet-unseen attacks or variations of those known present a real challenge in the design of these systems. IDSs are firmly entrenched on the security front but the exact role they can play and what their deployment entails must be clear to planners of security.

DAIS isolates likely suspicious actions before a definite determination of intrusion is reported. In this way, the database can be immunized from many malicious transactions. DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991538","","Data security;Database systems;Face detection;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems;Transaction databases","SQL;authorisation;data integrity;database management systems;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;transaction processing","COTS-DBMS-specific implementation;DAIS;Informix;Microsoft SQL Server;Oracle;Oracle Server;Sybase;authorized malicious transactions;commercial database applications;data attacks;database application platforms;database security mechanisms;end user transparency;first DAIS prototype;general isolation algorithm;integrity;intrusion tolerance;likely suspicious actions;malicious transactions;real-time data attack isolation system;transaction profiles;user SQL statements","","3","","33","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
