In this paper, we suggest a simulation framework using OMNeT++ to generate benchmarks that resemble real-life traffic. We approach the problem by dividing it into three modules (topology creation, good traffic generation, bad traffic generation), each of which we make realistic, similar to deployed and usable networks.

"Cascaded classifier approach based on Adaboost to increase detection rate of rare network attack categories","Natesan, P.; Rajesh, P.","Dept. of CSE, Kongu Eng.

Generally R2L and U2R attacks are very rare attacks and even in KDD Cup99 dataset, these attacks are only 2% of overall datasets. So, these result in model not able to efficiently learn the characteristics of rare categories and this will result in poor detection rates of rare attack categories like R2L and U2R attacks. We introduce a new approach called cascading classification model based on AdaBoost and Bayesian Network Classifier that can improve the detection rate of rare network attack categories. In this approach we train two classifiers with two different training sets. The KDD Cup99 dataset was splitted into two training sets where one contains full of non rare attacks datasets and other contains datasets of rare attack categories. This cascaded classifier approach increases the detection rates of both rare network attack categories and also it increase overall detection rate of an IDS model. The higher detection rates are due to the mitigation of the influence from the dominant categories if the rare attack categories are separated from the dataset.","","978-1-4673-1599-9","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206789","Adaboost;Bayesian Network;detection rate;dominant attacks;rare attacks","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Training","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","Adaboost;Bayesian Network Classifier;R2L attacks;U2R attacks;cascaded classifier approach;increase detection rate;network intrusion detection;rare network attack categories;unequal distributed attack","","0","","13","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This calls for monitoring solutions that operate at different layers than the application layer (services layer). In this paper we present our ongoing work towards the definition of a monitoring framework for SOAs and services, which relies on anomaly detection performed at the Application Server (AS) and the Operating System (OS) layers to identify events whose manifestation or effect is not adequately described a-priori.

The cyber and power infrastructures together constitute a large, complex cyberphysical system. ICTs on the power grids have evolved from isolated structures into open and networked environments based on TCP/IP and Ethernet. The technology is known to be vulnerable with respect to cyberintrusions. As ICTs of the power infrastructure have evolved into highly connected network environments, the use of firewalls has become a widely adopted access control method against intruders. Firewalls do not guarantee cybersecurity, however. The misconfiguration of company firewalls has been reported. Even if the configuration of a firewall is correct, it is still vulnerable because firewalls are not able to detect insider attacks and connections from the trusted side.

The process can be integrated as part of the intrusion model development process with proper tool support. This will help to identify possible errors in the intrusion model as early as possible. The contribution is to apply well-known aspects from software testing and implement them in the intrusion model testing and validation. The experimental implementation of the proposed process will concentrate on testing intrusion models focusing on detecting port scan attacks. This experiment will indicate that when the testing and validation is part of the intrusion model development process, the intrusion model developer receives immediate feedback and can quickly refine the intrusion model.

The traditional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) generally has the following disadvantages: the first one is that it could not detect the new type attacks even the variation of existed attacks; the second one is the detection time is so long that the real-time capability of the system is low. In this paper we proposed a new model based on LLE and BVM to solve the problems mentioned above. This model is different from traditional IDS, we use BVM classifier to differentiate the normal and abnormal attacks, and we added a pre-process module before the classifier. In the pre-process module, we use LLE to extract the main features of the intrusion data, which is the main part of the pre-process module, and then the principal components of the data are used as input of BVM classifier that differentiates the normal and abnormal actions. Applying this proposed system to KDDCUP99 data, experimental results clearly illustrates that this model has a remarkable performance in detecting both existed instruction and new ones.","","978-1-4244-8104-0","978-1-4244-8106-4","10.1109/ICINA.2010.5636736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5636736","BVM;IDS;LLE;component;feature extraction","Databases;Probes","Internet;computer network security;pattern classification","BVM classifier;Internet;KDDCUP99 data;LLE;intrusion detection system;network attacks;network security","","0","","13","","","18-19 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing","ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm","","3","","27","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Understanding the latest DDoS attacks can provide new insights for effective defense. But most of existing understandings are based on indirect traffic measures (e.g., backscatters) or traffic seen locally. In this study, we present an in-depth analysis based on 50,704 different Internet DDoS attacks directly observed in a seven-month period. These attacks were launched by 674 botnets from 23 different botnet families with a total of 9,026 victim IPs belonging to 1,074 organizations in 186 countries. Our analysis reveals several interesting findings about today's Internet DDoS attacks. Some highlights include: (1) geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction of future attacks for most active botnet families, (2) from the target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet families, (3) there is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or in turn. These findings add to the existing literature on the understanding of today's Internet DDoS attacks, and offer new insights for designing new defense schemes at different levels.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266866","","Cities and towns;Computer crime;Geology;IP networks;Internet;Malware;Organizations","IP networks;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Internet DDoS attacks;Internet distributed denial-of-service;botnet families;geolocation analysis;geospatial distribution;indirect traffic measures;interattack time interval;source prediction;start time prediction;victim IP","","","","","","","22-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such an intermediate host is called a stepping-stone. The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets. A number of algorithms have been proposed to detect stepping-stones, but some of them failed to detect correctly when the network traffic is somehow corrupted or with the chaff packets. We discuss the viability of solving those issues by improving a previous methodology. The algorithm is based on finding as many matched pairs of incoming and outgoing packets on the same host as possible and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the mismatched rate. We examine a number of tradeoffs in choosing the threshold values by simulating network traffic.

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters.

This has achieved the fairly high speed of 400MHz that supports 1-Gbps bandwidth by processing a few bits in parallel on to-day's major bit-serial Ethernet.","","0-7803-8114-9","","10.1109/APCC.2003.1274480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1274480","","Bandwidth;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Ethernet networks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Information security;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","field programmable gate arrays;local area networks;safety systems","400 MHz;FPGA;bit-serial Ethernet;field programmable gate array;host-based intrusion detection system;network interface card;real-time response;reconfigurable hardware implementation;wave-pipeline technique","","10","","16","","","21-24 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ordinary intrusion detection systems usually deal with network or OS attacks and could not detect database specific attacks. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find temporal patterns and rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels using a hybrid approach, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5358-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2014.7000815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000815","data mining;database security;inter-transaction rules;intrusion detection;specification;state machine","Data mining;Database systems;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Training","","","","0","","12","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we use two cost models. The first cost model assumes that all network intrusion detection devices have the same cost. The second model assumes that the cost of the device is relative to the traffic load on the network node on which it is installed. We evaluate two algorithms for finding the most prominent group in these cost models. The first algorithm is based on greedy choice of vertices and the second is based on heuristic search and finds the optimal deployment locations. We investigate combinations of heuristic functions based on solution cost and on solution utility and different node ordering strategies. We show that intelligent choice of the heuristic functions and node ordering can speed up the search. Empirical evaluation shows that while in the first cost model the greedy algorithm produces results that are negligibly close to optimal in the second cost model the difference between optimal and suboptimal solutions can be significant.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502182","","Communications Society;Cost function;Greedy algorithms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;search problems","DNIDS deployment utility;DNIPS;cost benefit deployment;cost model;group betweenness centrality;heuristic search;high-speed network;large-scale network;network intrusion detection devices;real time distributed network intrusion detection systems","","0","","27","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, no assumption can be made on the outcome of the attack, no assurance can be assumed once the system is compromised. The intrusion tolerance techniques focus on providing minimal level of services, even when the system has been partially compromised. This paper presents an intrusion tolerant approach for Denial of Service attacks to Web Services. It focuses on the detection of attack symptoms as well as the diagnosis of intrusion effects in order to perform a proper reaction only if the attack succeeds. In particular, this work focuses on a specific Denial of Service attack, called Deeply-Nested XML.

In the worst case, simultaneous intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single substation or multiple substations of a power grid.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2294473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786500","Anomaly detection;GOOSE anomaly detection;SMV anomaly detection and intrusion detection;cyber security of substations","Circuit breakers;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Power grids;Substation automation","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;power system reliability;substation automation","ADS;GOOSE;IED;SMV;catastrophic power outages;circuit breakers;cyber intrusions;generic object oriented substation event;host-based anomaly detection systems;integrated anomaly detection system;intelligent electronic devices;malicious behaviors;multicast messages;network-based anomaly detection systems;physical security;power grid;sampled measured value;severe cascading events;simultaneous anomaly detection;simultaneous intrusion detection method;substation automation testbed;substation facilities;substations;temporal anomalies;user-interfaces","","1","","37","","2014-04-10","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This research proposes a lightweight method to identify DoS attacks by analyzing host behaviors. Our method is based on the concept of BLINd Classification or BLINC: no access to packet payload, no knowledge of port numbers, and no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. Rather than using pre-defined signatures or rules as in typical Intrusion Detection Systems, BLINC maps flows into graphlets of each attack pattern. In this work we create three types of graphlets for the following DoS attack patterns: SYN flood, ICMP flood, and host scan. Results show that our method can identify all occurrences and all hosts associated with attack activities, with a low percentage of false positive.","1556-6463","978-1-4244-1230-3","978-1-4244-1230-3","10.1109/ICON.2007.4444065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4444065","","Availability;Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computer science;Floods;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","Internet;computer network reliability;telecommunication security","DoS attack;Internet;denial of service;lightweight detection;network security;system survivability","","4","","19","","","19-21 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address the knowledge gap by investigating the possible inclusion of a statistical based time series modeling that can be seamlessly integrated into existing cyber defense system. Cyber-attack processes exhibit long range dependence and in order to investigate such properties a new class of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average (GARMA) can be used. In this paper, GARMA (1,2; δ,1) model is fitted to cyber-attack data sets. Three different estimation methods are used to estimate the parameters. The Hannan-Rissanen Algorithm, Whittle Estimation Method and Maximum Likelihood Estimation methods are used to estimate the parameters of the GARMA (1,2;δ,1). Point forecasts to predict the attack rate possibly hours ahead of time also has been done and the performance of the models and estimation methods are discussed. The investigation of the case-study will confirm that by exploiting the statistical properties, it is possible to predict cyber-attacks (at least in terms of attack rate) with good accuracy. This kind of forecasting capability would provide sufficient early-warning time for defenders to adjust their defense configurations or resource allocations.","","978-1-4799-7625-6","","10.1109/NSITNSW.2015.7176399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176399","Communication Systems;Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average;Intrusion forecasting;Long range dependence;Predictive modeling","Autoregressive processes;Computational modeling;Forecasting;Hidden Markov models;Maximum likelihood estimation;Predictive models","autoregressive moving average processes;maximum likelihood estimation;resource allocation;security of data;time series","ARMA models;GARMA models;Hannan-Rissanen algorithm;Whittle estimation method;communication systems;cyber defense system;cyber-attack processes;generalized autoregressive moving average;intrusion detection systems;maximum likelihood estimation methods;parameter estimation;predictive modeling;resource allocation;time series modeling","","0","","17","","","17-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, to improve the current mitigation solution, this study intents to proposethe Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the mitigation rules approach to mitigate the ICMP attack. The mitigation rules are developed specifically to mitigate the ICMP attack and to suppress the number of false alarms. Project implementation is done using Snort, which is installed in the Linux platform. For evaluation purpose, testing is carried out with live private data in identical environment, with the default rules and the proposed mitigation rules enabled in the same LAN. Experimental result shows that deployment of mitigation rules is 63.95% efficient to mitigate the ICMP attack compared to the original Snort rules.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836547","DDoS Attack;ICMP Attack;IDS;Mitigation Rules","Availability;Computer crime;IP networks;Protocols;Syntactics;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","Internet;Linux;computer network security;local area networks;protocols","DDoS attack;ICMP attack mitigation;IDS;Internet control message protocol attack;LAN;Linux platform;Snort;intrusion detection system;mitigation rule approach;resource availability","","0","","22","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel attack and detection mechanism against a special type of packet dropping where the malicious node drops one packet or more and injects a new fake packet instead. Our novel detection mechanism is very powerful and has very high accuracy. It relies on a very simple yet powerful idea, the creation time of each packet.

According to the different network conditions of clusters, this scheme also can dynamically set different detection parameters for different clusters to achieve a more appropriate detection algorithm.

Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction. This action is hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS.

Hence, we propose to incorporate fuzzy clustering technique and Dempster-Shafer theory into our intrusion detection design for their merits of resolving uncertainty problems caused by ambiguous and limited information during a decision process. Also, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) technique is applied to speed up the detection process. For verifying the detection accuracy of our classifier, User to Root and Remote to Local attacks of DARPA KDD99 Intrusion Detection Evaluation data set were used. We compared the results of our proposed approach with those of k-NN classifier, fuzzy k-NN classifier and evidence-theoretic k-NN classifier.

Modern ID techniques must cope with increasingly sophisticated attacks as well as rapidly rising network line speeds. Signature based ID is forced to sample sparsely, increasing the likelihood of malicious traffic entering the network without scrutiny. Con sequently, flow-based ID is gaining attention as an effective complement. ID systems are furthermore often characterized as either network-based or host-based. The autonomous multi agent design paradigm is a scalable, attractive alternative for its potential to leverage the strengths of both architectures: the broad perspective and visibility into distributed malicious activity provided by network-based ID, and the comprehensive view of the local node provided by host-based ID. This paper therefore develops an architecture for a new multi agent, flow-based intrusion detection sysem. The architecture is designed in two iterations of increasing complexity. These innovative ID designs use a ""repuation"" system to permit agents to dynamically find nodes that are most effective for classifying malicious network activity. Furthermore, each system design includes the development of an innovative classifier that uses multi objective evolutionary algorithms to aid in the search for effective operational parameter values. Evaluation using an extensive agent simulation framework highlights the conditions under which the reputation system provides a significant classification benefit.","Pending","978-1-4244-7834-7","","10.1109/CEC.2011.5949798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949798","","Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Object oriented modeling;Pattern recognition;Peer to peer computing","computer network security;multi-agent systems;telecommunication traffic","autonomous multiagent design;computer network protection;flow-based ID;flow-based intrusion detection;malicious network activity classification;malicious traffic;network attack classification;signature-based ID","","1","2","17","","","5-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks.

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity.

However, due to the sensitive and confidential nature of the data involved, entities have to employ various anonymization techniques to meet legal requirements in compliance with confidentiality policies. Nevertheless, the very composition of network trace data makes it a challenge when applying anonymization techniques. On the other hand, basic application of microdata anonymization techniques on network traces is problematic and does not deliver the necessary data usability. Therefore, as a contribution, we point out some of the ongoing challenges in the network trace anonymization. We then suggest usability-aware anonymization heuristics by employing microdata privacy techniques while giving consideration to usability of the anonymized data. Our preliminary results show that with trade-offs, it might be possible to generate anonymized network traces with enhanced usability, on a case-by-case basis using micro-data anonymization techniques.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237310","Differential Privacy;Generalization;K-anonymity;Network Trace Anonymization;Usability","Cryptography;Data privacy;Databases;IP networks;Noise;Privacy;Usability","data privacy","anonymized network traces;collaborative research;confidentiality policies;data usability;microdata anonymization;microdata privacy;network trace data publication;network trace data sharing;usability-aware anonymization heuristics;usability-aware network trace anonymization","","0","","39","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, all these security devices can not guarantee computer systems protection because each one is implemented as a stand-alone system for solving a particular security problem and it is not designed to communicate with the others.

The existing signature-based intrusion detection mechanisms are often not sufficient in detecting many types of attacks. K-means is a popular anomaly intrusion detection method to classify unlabeled data into different categories. However, it suffers from the local convergence and high false alarms. In this paper, two soft computing techniques, fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence, are used to solve these problems. We proposed SFK-means approach which inherits the advantages of K-means, Fuzzy K-means and Swarm K- means, simultaneously we improve the deficiencies. The most advantages of our SFK-means algorithm are solving the local convergence problem in Fuzzy K- means and the sharp boundary problem in Swarm K- means.

There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider.

Interestingly, these two can present conflicting demands. We provide a first formulation of a new class of problems focusing on the engineering of attack-resistant networks. Our model considers both resiliency and security, and uses a notion of blocking probability as a rigorous measure for evaluating different network constructions. We propose several efficient approximation algorithms for computing blocking probability and provide bounds for their errors. Based on these algorithms, we introduce a family of heuristics to guide the construction of optimal attack-resistant networks with minimum blocking probabilities.

Intrusion detection/prevention systems provide defenses against these attacks by monitoring headers and payload of packets flowing through the network. Multiple string matching that can compare hundreds of string patterns simultaneously is a critical component of these systems, and is a well-studied problem. Most of the string matching solutions today are based on the classic Aho-Corasick algorithm, which has an inherent limitation; they can process only one input character in one cycle. As memory speed is not growing at the same pace as network speed, this limitation has become a bottleneck in the current network, having speeds of tens of gigabits per second. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple string matching algorithm that can process multiple characters at a time thus achieving multi-gigabit rate search speeds. We also propose an architecture for an efficient implementation on TCAM-based hardware. We additionally propose novel optimizations by making use of the properties of TCAMs to significantly reduce the memory requirements of the proposed algorithm.

This automation allows ML-IDS to detect network attacks and proactively protect against them. ML-IDS inspects and analyzes network traffic using three levels of granularities (traffic flow, packet header, and payload), and employs an efficient fusion decision algorithm to improve the overall detection rate and minimize the occurrence of false alarms. We have individually evaluated each of our approaches against a wide range of network attacks, and then compared the results of these approaches with the results of the combined decision fusion algorithm.","","978-0-7695-3175-5","978-0-7695-3175-5","10.1109/ICAC.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550834","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Automatic control;Communication system traffic control;Control systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Protocols","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","anomaly-based attack;attack detection;autonomic computing;classification-based attack;false alarm;fusion decision;multilevel intrusion detection system;network attacks;network traffic;packet header;payload traffic;signature-based attack;traffic flow","","8","","42","","","2-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 34th Conference on","20091218","2009","","","899","906","Packet classification is one of the crucial components of application such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.","","978-1-4244-4488-5","978-1-4244-4487-8","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038","","Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats","","0","","23","","","20-23 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One problem not yet being addressed by previous research was the processing time taken as the packet traffics to be analysed for detecting any intrusion grows bigger.

The most common surveillance system, CCTV, produces a continuous image and has various problems such as high cost, need for continuous human intervention, and an inherent difficulty in locating and identifying the intruder due to the presence of obstacles. This paper proposes a scheme to classify a person's movement as intrusive or non-intrusive in a semantic way. The classification is aided with the help of sensor network. The sensor network is considered to be heterogeneous. It uses a PIR sensor for movement detection, an RFID sensor for identifying the person and an image sensor for verification. This system uses both wired and wireless networks for efficient data transfer. Data from either networks are synchronised using time and location information. The proposed Intruder Detection System identifies a person as an intruder, if there is any mismatch in the sensed information.","","978-1-61284-261-5","","10.1109/ICOAC.2010.5725357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5725357","Closed Circuit Television (CCTV);Intrusion Detection;Passive Infrared (PIR);Surveillance System;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)","Cameras;Databases;Radiofrequency identification;Semantics;Servers;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","closed circuit television;computer network security;image classification;image motion analysis;image sensors;image sequences;radiofrequency identification;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","CCTV;PIR sensor;RFID sensor;closed circuit television;data transfer;human intervention;image sensor;movement detection;passive infrared;semantic intruder detection system;surveillance system;wireless sensor network","","1","","9","","","14-16 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, most of the current researches are using only one engine for detection of various attacks; the proposed system is constructed by a number of agents, which are totally different in both training and detecting processes. Each of the agents has its own strength on capturing a kind of network behavior and hence the system has strength on detecting different types of attack. In addition, its ability on detecting new types of attack as well as a higher tolerant to fluctuations were shown.

And faults of the sensing value are common due to the artificial attacker and the lack of physical protection. Therefore, we propose a key management and distributed abnormal area scanning scheme using spatial, temporal correlation and in-network aggregation for secure UPC. Simulations show that our scheme can clearly identify the abnormal sensors with high accuracy even in the existence of normal sensors, abnormal sensor, and event-detecting sensors.
