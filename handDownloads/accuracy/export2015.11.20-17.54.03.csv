When the identification and classification of network flows is done using machine learning, the characterization of traffic still requires an approach that is capable of providing a balance between accuracy and processing speed in real-time scenarios. This paper proposes an architecture to classify network traffic based on Stream Data Mining techniques using Graphic Processing Units (GPU), in order to meet the requirements of both classification accuracy and speed. Our proposal combines the characteristics of data mining techniques with a continuous stream of input data, and with high processing performance GPU architecture. Results show that our approach provides accuracy comparable to or better than existing related work (e.g., above 95%) while ramping up performance (e.g., up to 62x speed up), comparing the different implementations of our approach. These facts allow the deployment of the proposed technique to the real-time management of high speed backbone links.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912457","Computer Networks;Flow-based Classification;GPU;Stream Data Mining;Traffic Classification","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Entropy;Graphics processing units;Ports (Computers);Registers","computer network management;data mining;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","GPU architecture;GPU-oriented stream data mining traffic classification;classification accuracy;graphic processing units;machine learning;network flow classification;network flow identification;network management;network traffic classification;networked applications;speed backbone links;traffic profile","","1","","25","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But network intrusions are now becoming more and more sophisticated to detect, thus, collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) have been proposed which enables an IDS to collect information and learn experience from other IDS nodes. By maintaining interactions among a set of IDS nodes, a CIDN is expected to be more powerful in detecting some complicated attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS) than a single IDS. In real deployment, we identify that each IDS may have different levels of sensitivity in detecting different types of intrusions (i.e., based on their own signatures and settings). In this paper, we therefore define a notion of intrusion sensitivity and investigate the feasibility of using it to evaluate the trustworthiness of an IDS node. In addition, we describe several challenges when using this notion in practice. In the evaluation, the experimental results indicate that the use of intrusion sensitivity is feasible and encouraging to enhance the accuracy of detecting malicious nodes.","","978-1-4799-2548-3","","10.1109/CIS.2013.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746483","Collaborative Intrusion Detection Network;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Sensitivity;Trust Management","Accuracy;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Robustness;Sensitivity","computer crime;groupware;trusted computing","CIDN;DoS attack;IDS nodes;attacks identification;collaborative intrusion detection networks;denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection systems;intrusion sensitivity;malicious nodes detection;trust evaluation;trustworthiness","","0","","24","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this paper is the description of a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis of IMs using signal-based method. It is based on signal processing and an unsupervised classification technique called the artificial ant clustering.

Around four hundred mobile viruses, worms, trojans and spy ware, together with approximately one thousand of their variants have been discovered to-date. So far no classification of such mobile P2P security threats exists. There is no well known simulation environment to model mobile P2P network characteristics and provide a platform for the analysis of the propagation of different types of mobile malware. Therefore, our research provides a classification of mobile malware based on the behaviour of a node during infection and develops a platform to analyse malware propagation. It proposes and evaluates a novel behaviour-based approach, using AI, for the detection of various malware families. Unlike existing approaches, our approach focuses on identifying and classifying malware families rather than detecting individual malware and their variants. Adaptive detection of currently known and previously unknown mobile malware on designated mobile nodes through a deployed detection framework aided by AI classifiers enables successful detection. Although we have classified around 30% of the existing mobile P2P malware into 13 distinct malware families based on their behaviour during infection, this paper focuses on two, Cabir & Commwarrior, in order to analyse the proposed detection framework.","","978-1-4577-1931-8","","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113305","MPeersim;Malware Classification;Malware Detection;Malware Families;Malware Propagation;Mobile Agents;Mobile P2P Networks","Analytical models;Batteries;Bluetooth;Grippers;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","computer network security;computer viruses;invasive software;mobile agents;mobile computing;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing","AI classifier;Cabir families;Commwarrior families;behaviour-based approach;malware family classification;mobile P2P malware detection framework;mobile malware classification;mobile network security;mobile node;mobile spyware;mobile trojan;mobile virus;mobile worm","","0","","18","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, it is easy to deploy and terminate large number of malicious virtual machines (VMs) in a few seconds while the administrator is probably difficult to identify these malicious VMs immediately. These features open doors for attackers to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that target at degrading the quality of cloud service. This paper studies an attack scenario that malicious tenants use cloud resources to launch DoS attack targeting at data center subnets. Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors. We conduct our experiments in the campus-wide data center, and the results show our detection system can promptly and accurately response to DoS attacks.","","978-1-4799-8086-4","","10.1109/CBD.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176094","Attack Detection;Cloud Data Center;DoS Attack;Information Entropy","","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security;data flow analysis;entropy;system monitoring;virtual machines","CPU usage;DoS attack;attack behavior;attack identification;campus-wide data center;cloud data center;cloud resources;cloud service quality degradation;data center subnets;data flow based detection;data flow pattern;entropy-based denial of service attack detection;information entropy;malicious VM;malicious tenants;malicious virtual machines;network resource isolation;network usage;virtual machine status monitoring","","0","","21","","","20-22 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, no change is requested in the implementation of the node. The main challenge stems from difficulty involved in stating the occurrence of an attack based on second-hands evidences that may come from colluding attacker (s). To tackle this issue, we propose an entropy-based trust system that evaluates the trustworthiness of the nodes that provide the evidences.

We propose a two-phase indexless search procedure for application in misuse detection-based IDS that makes use of q-gram distance instead of the constrained edit distance. We study how well q-gram distance approximates edit distance with special constraints needed in IDS applications. We compare the performances of the search procedure with the two distances applied in it.

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point.

Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems either focus on just one layer of observation or use a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. This paper describes a synergistic approach of fusing decisions of whether an attack takes place by using multiple measurements from different layers of wireless communication networks. The described method is implemented on a live system that monitors a wireless network in real time and gives an indication of whether a malicious frame exists or not. This is achieved by analysing specific metrics and comparing them against historical data. The proposed system assigns for each metric a belief of whether an attack takes place or not. The beliefs from different metrics are fused with the Dempster-Shafer technique with the ultimate goal of limiting false alarms by combining beliefs from various network layers. The on-line experimental results show that cross-layer techniques and data fusion perform more efficiently compared to conventional methods.","","978-1-4577-0455-0","","10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088478","Cross-layer measurements;Data fusion;Dempster-Shafer;Wi-Fi;Wireless attacks","Intrusion detection;Measurement;Monitoring;Real time systems;Web sites;Wireless networks","inference mechanisms;radiocommunication;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer technique;computer network;cross-layer technique;intrusion detection system;malicious frame;multilayer data fusion;online wireless attack detection system;synergistic approach;wireless communication network","","0","","11","","","10-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since MFs are transmitted without encryption or authentication, attackers can easily launch various attacks by forging the MFs. In a collaborative environment with many Wi-Fi sniffers, such attacks can be easily detected by sensing the anomaly RSS changes. However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method.

The main function of Intrusion Detection System is to protect the resources from threats. It analyzes and predicts the behaviours of users, and then these behaviours will be considered an attack or a normal behaviour. There are several techniques which exist at present to provide more security to the network, but most of these techniques are static. Test the proposed method by a benchmark intrusion dataset to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. Results show that choosing good attributes and samples will not only have impact on the performance, but also on the overall execution efficiency.

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing. Experimental results demonstrate the cases in which the performance of AACK is either improved or degraded when the number of MNs changes.","","978-1-4673-6617-5","","10.1109/CLOUDCOMP.2015.7149666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7149666","","Ad hoc networks;Delays;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;security of data","AACK;IDS;MANETs;MNs;NS2;adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;mobile nodes","","0","","15","","","26-29 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The bio-inspired model platform is designed and implemented based on two sub-platforms. One is the ERS (Ecogent Runtime Services) platform that provides basic functions of a mobile agent including registration, life cycle, migration, communication, location and fault tolerance. The other is the bio platform that provides the capability of evolution and adaptability through genetic algorithm and stigmergy controls.

A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs, as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures).Many studies report that IDSs, including signature-based network IDSs, have problems to accurately identify attacks. One possible reason that we observed in our past work, and that is worth investigating further, is that several signatures (i.e., several alarms) can be triggered on the same group of packets, a situation we coined overlapping signatures. This paper presents a technique to precisely and systemat ically quantify the signature overlapping problem of an IDS signature database. The solution we describe is based on set theory and finite state automaton theory, and we experiment with our technique on one widely-used and maintained IDS. Results show that our approach is effective at systematically quantifying the overlap problem in one IDS signature database, and can be potentially used on other IDSs.","1530-0889","978-1-4244-9232-9","978-1-4244-9231-2","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958211","Automaton Theory;Intrusion Detection Signature;Set Theory","Automata;Databases;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Set theory;Systematics","authorisation;digital signatures;finite state machines;set theory","anti-virus systems;computer networks;finite state automaton theory;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;set theory;signature overlaps;signature-based network IDS","","2","","18","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, sophisticated attackers attempt to disable the IDS before they launch a thorough attack. Therefore, to accomplish its function, an IDS should have some mechanism to guarantee uninterrupted detection service even in the face of IDS component failures due to attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion-tolerant mechanism for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) that employ multiple independent components. The mechanism monitors the detection units and the hosts on which the units reside and enables the IDS to survive component failure due to intrusions. As soon as a failed IDS component is discovered, a copy of the component is installed to replace it and the detection service continues. We implement the intrusion-tolerant mechanism based on the CSI-KNN-based NIDS and evaluate the prototype in the face of component failures. The results demonstrate that the mechanism can effectively tolerate intrusions.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529353","Intrusion detection systems;Intrusion-tolerance","Availability;Computer crashes;Detectors;Face detection;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Prototypes;Telecommunication traffic","pattern classification;security of data","CSI-KNN;intrusion-tolerant mechanism;network intrusion detection systems;uninterrupted detection service","","2","","13","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","","978-1-4673-0296-8","978-1-4673-0297-5","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","0","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization.

As an effective clustering method, PDDP is unusual in that it is divisive, as opposed to agglomerative, and operates by splitting clusters into two smaller sub-clusters repeatedly. The splits are not based on any distance or similarity measure. By introducing the idea of PDDP method to intrusion detection, the number of clusters is able to be determined automatically. PDDPC have two advantages, one is that the singular value decomposition (SVD) can be stopped at the first singular value/vector and this makes PDDPC significantly more computational advantages, the other is that no distance and similarity measure is needed to define. The results of the experiments with KDD CUP1999 data show that this scheme can improve the detection quality effectively.

Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5658-6","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030322","Database Security;Inter-Transaction Dependency;Inter-Transaction Sequence;Intrusion Detection;State machine","Authentication;Databases","data mining;security of data","access control;anomaly detection;data mining;database intrusion detection;database transaction level;encryption;intertransaction level;user task level","","0","","12","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801","Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks","","6","","17","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a probabilistic classification is proposed and combined with the class association rule mining of GNP, and applied to Network intrusion detection for the performance evaluation.

A novel 'multiple' smoothing parameters, which is different from the standard algorithm in which only single smoothing parameter was adopted (Matlab neural network toolbox, for example), were assigned to GRNN model. K-means clustering algorithm was developed so as to reduce the number of smoothing parameters. The training data was firstly partitioned into groups (the number of groups was much smaller than that of training samples) using K-means clustering. A smoothing parameter was then assigned to this group. A recently emerging estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) was employed to optimize the multiple smoothing parameters. EDA presented in this paper was a kind of optimization algorithm based on Gaussian probability distribution. As a case study, the proposed approach was applied to establish a non-linear model between the parameters of the coal-fired boiler and the NOx emissions. The results showed that the number of cluster has significant effect on the predictive accuracy of GRNN model. GRNN model with multiple smoothing parameters showed better agreement than that with only one smoothing parameter. The modeling errors on the testing subset were 1.24% and 1.62% for GRNN models trained by the present algorithm and the standard algorithm, respectively.","","978-0-7695-3304-9","","10.1109/ICNC.2008.478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4666963","EDA;GRNN;K-means Clustering;Nitrogen Oxides;Power plants","Boilers;Clustering algorithms;Electronic design automation and methodology;Mathematical model;Neural networks;Nitrogen;Partitioning algorithms;Probability distribution;Smoothing methods;Training data","Gaussian distribution;air pollution;boilers;neural nets;nitrogen compounds;optimisation;pattern clustering;power engineering computing;regression analysis","'multiple' smoothing parameters;EDA;GRNN;Gaussian probability distribution;K-means clustering;coal-fired boiler;estimation of distribution algorithm;generalized regression neural network;nitrogen oxides prediction;optimization algorithm","","3","","10","","","18-20 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Twenty-Third Annual","20080102","2007","","","53","63","The effectiveness and precision of network-based intrusion detection signatures can be evaluated either by direct analysis of the signatures (if they are available) or by using black-box testing (if the system is closed-source). Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying ""blindspots"" in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing","data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data","attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing","","1","","30","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm. Test results show that comparing with previous clustering methods, IE&FSDM algorithm improve the detection rate of anomaly behavior and reduce the false alarm rate.","","","","10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973690","Anomaly Detection;Clustering;Discrepancy Metric;Information Entropy;k-menas","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information entropy;Measurement;Testing;Training","entropy;pattern clustering;security of data","DR value;FAR value;IE&FSDM algorithm;KDD CUP1999 dataset;anomaly detection;clustering analysis;frequency sensitive discrepancy metric;information entropy;intrusion detection technology;k-means clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","7-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, securing network from inside is necessary, particularly when security hierarchical exist between users. One of the major problems in conducting research on IPv6 security is the absence of a reliable dataset, which is essential in testing and evaluating the proposed solutions. This research develops a reliable dataset of IPv6 NDP by capturing the normal and abnormal behaviors of NDP using specific dependable tools.

In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","4","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The objective of this paper is to incorporate different methods to detect and classify intrusion from normal network packet. Among several evolutionary techniques, Steady State Genetic-based Machine Leaning Algorithm (SSGBML) will be used to detect intrusions with Zeroth Level Classifier system (ZCS) are investigated here. Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations. ZCS is used to play the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether the current message is normal or intrusion and receiving feedback from environment.

We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks. We evaluate a set of time-based Markovian heuristics against a simple compression algorithm and show that we are able to detect the existence of all attacks which were manually identified by security personnel, drastically reduce the number of false positives, and identify attacks which were overlooked during manual evaluation.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284168","anomaly detection;hidden markov model;intrusion detection;markov chain","Conference management;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Needles;Sensor systems","data compression;hidden Markov models;security of data","anomaly detection techniques;compression algorithm;deviation detection;false alarm suppression;generalized tools;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection data sets;intrusion detection sensors;managed security service providers;software version;time-based Markovian heuristics","","0","","28","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, little work exists in actually implementing such schemes on small handheld devices. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of a secure routing protocol based on AODV over IPv6, further reinforced by a routing protocol independent intrusion detection system (IDS) for ad hoc networks. Security features in the routing protocol include mechanisms for nonrepudiation and authentication, without relying on the availability of a certificate authority (CA) or a key distribution center (KDC). We present the design and implementation details of our system, the practical considerations involved, and how these mechanisms can be used to detect and thwart malicious attacks. We discuss several scenarios where the secure routing and intrusion detection mechanisms isolate and deny network resources to nodes deemed malicious.

The fundamental building blocks of this system is the concept of building chronological ordered sequence of events which represent the details of the attacks (ARP). Then by applying the three weighting models we are able to provide more realistic views of attacks. This concept of weighting, where different events are assigned different weights, serves as the basis of the alert regression profile allowing the use of thresholds. Thresholds represent the fine balance between the accuracy of the alert and its timeliness.

We also develop novel techniques that significantly increases the accuracy, efficiency, and secrecy of ITM localization attacks. Specifically, we introduce (i) a frequency-based modulation technique to effectively reduce the interference from the background traffic and achieve a high attack accuracy, (ii) both time and space hopping techniques to randomize signal pattern and make the attack hard to detect by the defender, and (iii) Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) based techniques to increase the attack efficiency of identifying multiple monitors simultaneously.

"Robust Correlation of Encrypted Attack Traffic through Stepping Stones by Flow Watermarking","Xinyuan Wang; Reeves, D.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on","20110314","2011","8","3","434","449","Network-based intruders seldom attack their victims directly from their own computer. Often, they stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones” in order to conceal their identity and origin. To identify the source of the attack behind the stepping stone(s), it is necessary to correlate the incoming and outgoing flows or connections of a stepping stone. To resist attempts at correlation, the attacker may encrypt or otherwise manipulate the connection traffic. Timing-based correlation approaches have been shown to be quite effective in correlating encrypted connections. However, timing-based correlation approaches are subject to timing perturbations that may be deliberately introduced by the attacker at stepping stones. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based-correlation scheme that is designed specifically to be robust against timing perturbations. Unlike most previous timing-based correlation approaches, our watermark-based approach is “active” in that it embeds a unique watermark into the encrypted flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. The unique watermark that is embedded in the encrypted flow gives us a number of advantages over passive timing-based correlation in resisting timing perturbations by the attacker. In contrast to the existing passive correlation approaches, our active watermark-based correlation does not make any limiting assumptions about the distribution or random process of the original interpacket timing of the packet flow. In theory, our watermark-based correlation can achieve arbitrarily close to 100 percent correlation true positive rate (TPR), and arbitrarily close to 0 percent false positive rate (FPR) at the same time for sufficiently long flows, despite arbitrarily large (but bounded) timing perturbations of any distribution by the attacker. Our paper is the first that identifies 1) accurate quantitative tradeoffs between the achievable correlation effectiveness - nd the defining characteristics of the timing perturbation; and 2) a provable upper bound on the number of packets needed to achieve a desired correlation effectiveness, given the amount of timing perturbation. Experimental results show that our active watermark-based correlation performs better and requires fewer packets than existing, passive timing-based correlation methods in the presence of random timing perturbations.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551157","Network-level security and protection;correlation;intrusion tracing;stepping stone.","Correlation;Cryptography;Decoding;Delay;Robustness;Watermarking","cryptography;random processes;watermarking","encrypted attack traffic;false positive rate;flow watermarking;network based intruder;random timing perturbation;stepping stones;true positive rate;watermark based correlation scheme","","1","","37","","2010-08-19","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In general, our approach uses a computationally low-cost solution to define the area of interest for tracking of multiple, moving objects. Despite its simplicity, it compares very well to existing approaches due to its robustness towards environmental changes. To demonstrate this, we present results of processing a sequence of JPEG-compressed monocular images of a parking lot in order to track pedestrians, cars and bicycles. Despite a high level of noise and changing lighting conditions, the algorithm successfully segments a moving object and tracks its position along a trajectory.","","0-7695-2319-6","","10.1109/CRV.2005.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443140","Interlace Filter;Motion Detection;Motion Tracking;Surveillance","Computer vision;Filters;Image coding;Image sequences;Motion detection;Motion estimation;Robustness;Tracking;Video compression;Working environment noise","computer vision;filtering theory;image sequences;motion estimation;target tracking;tracking filters;video signal processing","2-frame interlaced video signal;JPEG-compressed monocular images;computer vision systems;high performance low-level filter;interlace filter;motion tracking;multiple moving object tracking;noisy image sequences;people tracking;robust motion detection;robust motion estimation;surveillance","","4","","10","","","9-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most cases are trapped in the system due to a huge backlog of cases, excessive litigation in urban areas, corruption by the court staff and lack of proper monitoring of the functioning of courts. Efficient supervision and monitoring of courts can help in resolving some of the key problems in the system. We present preliminary results from a novel case record-keeping, management and monitoring solution that is able to meet several key performance goals of the National Judicial Policy. The overall aim of the work is to facilitate the work of the monitoring judges by helping them find the proverbial needle in the haystack and not get deluged by the volume of data routinely produced by the typical case-management systems. In this paper, we explore the application of intrusion detection techniques, such as the statistical anomaly detection schemes, to case management systems and present the results from our extensive case studies. Our proposed system, now in pilot, shows high accuracy in flagging anomalous cases, reduces the overall volume of information generated by the system and can help target several of the key reasons behind case pendency while bringing much needed transparency to the overall case-flow.","","","","10.1109/HICSS.2014.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758839","Judiciary;anomaly detection;monitoring","Auditory system;Delays;Engines;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optical character recognition software","law administration;security of data","Pakistan;case management systems;case record-keeping;case-management systems;intrusion detection techniques;judicial process delay;litigation;national judicial policy;remote court monitoring;statistical anomaly detection schemes","","0","","19","","","6-9 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Control-flow-based detectors monitor the sequence of system calls, while data-flow-based detectors monitor the data propagation among arguments of system calls. Besides pointing out that data-flow-based detectors can be layered on top of control-flow-based ones (or vice versa) to improve accuracy, there is a large gap between the two research directions in that research along one direction had been fairly isolated and had not made good use of results from the other direction. In this paper, we show how data-flow analysis can leverage results from control-flow analysis to learn more accurate and useful rules for anomaly detection. Our results show that the proposed control-flow-analysis-aided data-flow analysis reveals some accurate and useful rules that cannot be learned in prior data-flow analysis techniques. These relations among system call arguments and return values are useful in detecting many real attacks. A trace-driven evaluation shows that the proposed technique enjoys low false-alarm rates and overhead when implemented on a production server.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721575","anomaly detection;control-flow;data-flow;system call argument","Computer security;Control system analysis;Control systems;Counting circuits;Data analysis;Detectors;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis","data flow analysis;security of data","anomaly detection;control-flow analysis;control-flow-based detectors;data propagation;data-flow analysis;data-flow-based detectors;false-alarm rates;intrusion detection;production server;system calls","","3","","21","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These targeted attacks use special-crafted malware and infrequent activity to avoid detection, so that hackers can retain control over target systems unnoticed for long periods of time. In order to detect these stealthy activities, a large-volume of traffic data generated in a period of time has to be analyzed. We proposed a scalable solution, Ctracer to detect stealthy command and control channel in a large-volume of traffic data. APT uses multiple command and control (C&C) channel and change them frequently to avoid detection, but there are common signatures in those C&C sessions. By identifying common network signature, Ctracer is able to group the C&C sessions. Therefore, we can detect an APT and all the C&C session used in an APT attack. The Ctracer is evaluated in a large enterprise for four months, twenty C&C servers, three APT attacks are reported. After investigated by the enterprise's Security Operations Center (SOC), the forensic report shows that there is specific enterprise targeted APT cases and not ever discovered for over 120 days.","","978-1-4673-7277-0","","10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207270","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT);Command and Control (C&amp;C);mapreduce;networking logs","Command and control systems;Computers;Electronic mail;Internet;Itemsets;Malware;Servers","business data processing;computer crime;digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software","APT attack;C&C channel;C&C sessions;Ctracer;SOC;Security Operations Center;advanced persistent threat;enterprise log data;forensic report;hackers;malware;network signature;scalable framework;stealthy activities detection;stealthy command and control channel detection;targeted attacks;traffic data","","0","","25","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to allow for automated reasoning on the information resources available for the fusion process, we design a set of comprehensive and extensible ontologies, and implemented fusion and detection algorithms as simple rules in Ontologic Web Language Description Logic (OWL-DL), using the Semantic Query-Enhance Web Rule Language (SQWRL). To illustrate and evaluate our approach, we use one of the attack scenarios of the DARPA 2000 dataset. The results obtained show that our approach can reduce false positives, while achieving the same detection rates achieved by using the Snort and ISS RealSecure.","","","","10.1109/CRiSIS.2013.6766352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766352","","Context;Correlation;Databases;Decision making;Intrusion detection;Ontologies","knowledge representation languages;query processing;security of data;ubiquitous computing","DARPA 2000 dataset;OWL-DL;SQWRL;automated reasoning;distributed intrusion detection systems;extensible ontologies;multi sensor detection;ontologic Web language description logic;real-world intrusion detection systems;semantic query-enhance Web rule language;semantic-based context-aware alert fusion","","0","","26","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three approaches, i.e. (1) deep normalisation of log messages (2) storing data in the main memory and (3) running data analysis directly in the database, allow us to increase processing speed in such a way, that machine learning analysis of security events becomes possible nearly in real-time.

The behavior of the system is defined in terms of a ""behavior set"" rather than using a single parameter. This facilitates greater accuracy in describing the behavior of the system and helps in reducing false-positives.
