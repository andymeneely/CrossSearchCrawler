A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is very central to ensure the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, reliability of these detectors and to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems are basic information related to TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11 specific attacks such as de-authentication attack or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11 specific intrusions. Our model of feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a mean to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm.","","978-1-4244-1751-3","978-1-4244-1752-0","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530270","Feature Selection;Information Gain Ratio;Intrusion Detection Systems;K-means;Wireless Networks","Accuracy;Degradation;Detectors;Face detection;Filters;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Protocols;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","access protocols;feature extraction;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;MAC layer;TCP/IP header;feature selection;illegal penetration;intrusion detection system;k-means classifier","","2","","15","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks. The empirical results demonstrate that dual-variant execution has on average 17 percent performance overhead when deployed on multicore processors.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714703","Intrusion detection;multivariant execution;n-variant execution;system call.","Kernel;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Security;Synchronization;Writing","computer crime;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","asynchronous signal;attack detection;code injection attack;computer systems attack;dual variant execution;false alarm;intrusion detection system;monitoring mechanism;multicore processor;multiprocess application;multithreaded application;multivariant execution technique;replicated execution","","5","1","45","","2011-02-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Towards a unified approach to the representation of, and reasoning with, probabilistic risk information about software and its system interface","Feather, M.S.","Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Technol., Pasadena, CA, USA","Software Reliability Engineering, 2004. ISSRE 2004. 15th International Symposium on","20050124","2004","","","391","402","Early risk assessment is key in planning the development of systems, including systems that involve software. Such risk assessment needs a combination of the following elements; 1) Severity estimates for the potential effects of failures, and likelihood estimates for their causes; 2) Fault trees that link causes to failures; 3) Efficacy estimates of design and process steps towards reducing risk; 4) Distinctions between preventing, alleviating and detecting (thereafter removing), risks; 5) Risk preventions that have potential side effects of themselves introducing risks. The paper shows a unified approach that accommodates all these elements. The approach combines fault trees (from probabilistic risk assessment methods) with explicit treatment of risk mitigations (a generalization of the notion of a ""detection"" seen in FMECA analyses). Fault trees capture the causal relationships by which failure mechanisms may combine to lead to failure modes. Risk mitigations encompass (and distinguish among) options to prevent risks, detect risks, and alleviate risks (i.e., decrease their impact should they occur). This approach has been embodied in extensions to a JPL-developed risk assessment tool, and is illustrated here on software risk assessment information drawn from an actual project's software system FMECA (failure modes, effects and criticality analysis). Since its elements are typical of risk assessment of software and its system interface, the findings should be relevant to a wide range of software systems.","1071-9458","0-7695-2215-7","","10.1109/ISSRE.2004.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383134","Cost-benefit tradeoffs;FMEA;FMECA;FTA;Failure Modes;PRA;Probabilistic Risk Reduction;Risk-informed decision-making;SFMECA","Application software;Costs;Failure analysis;Fault detection;Fault trees;Protection;Risk analysis;Risk management;Software systems;Space vehicles","decision making;fault trees;maximum likelihood estimation;risk management;software development management","FTA;PRA;SFMECA;cost-benefit tradeoffs;failure modes;fault trees;probabilistic risk reduction;risk assessment;risk-informed decision-making;system interface","","7","","20","","","2-5 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes an innovative Machine Learning algorithm called Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) which utilizes semi-parametric learning model and Adaptive boosting techniques to reduce learning bias and generalization variance in difficult classification. In this paper, BMPNN is implemented as a classifier to detect different types of network anomalies in the KDD-99 benchmark.

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.","","978-1-4577-0458-1","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956","anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis","Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training","security of data","file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits","","2","","24","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The former three parts are used to form a secure transmission mechanism between the controller side and the plant side, which is responsible for enforcing the data confidentiality and checking the data integrity and authenticity. To guarantee the control system performance when suffering from deception attacks, the RNPC method based on round-trip time delays is proposed to compensate for the adverse effects introduced by the deception attacks as well as the network communication constraints, such as time-varying network delay, packet disorder and packet dropout.

In contrary to other adopted methods, the proposed approach does not rely on symptoms of infection to detect compromised machines. This allows the inference of malware infection at very early stages of contamination. The approach aims at detecting whether the machines are infected or not as well as pinpointing the exact malware type/family, if the machines were found to be compromised. The latter insights allow network security operators of diverse organizations, Internet service providers and backbone networks to promptly detect their clients' compromised machines in addition to effectively providing them with tailored anti-malware/patch solutions. To achieve the intended goals, the proposed approach exploits the darknet Internet space and employs statistical methods to infer large-scale probing activities. Subsequently, such activities are correlated with malware samples by leveraging fuzzy hashing and entropy based techniques. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using 60 GB of real darknet traffic and 65 thousand real malware samples. The results concur that the rationale of exploiting probing activities for worldwide early malware infection detection is indeed very promising. Further, the results demonstrate that the extracted inferences exhibit noteworthy accuracy and can generate significant cyber security insights that could be used for effective mitigation.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883391","","Correlation;Entropy;Internet;Malware;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;computer network security;cryptography;entropy;fuzzy reasoning;invasive software","Internet scale infections;darknet Internet;entropy based techniques;fuzzy hashing;inference;malware infection detection;network security operators;probing activities","","0","","27","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.","","1-4244-1500-4","1-4244-1500-4","10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management","","0","","14","","","13-15 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect the attacks hitting the network it is very obligatory to properly monitor the flow of network data. Network data is pre-processed before classification. Feature Selection is one of the preprocessing technique which eliminates irrelevant features and select more informative features from the data set with respect to the task to be performed. Feature Selection techniques is adopted as it is computationally efficient, simplified, have more feature interpretability, less learning time, improves data relevancy. Feature Selection can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies. Feature Selection selects a subset of the features in the training set and further using this subset as features in classification. Feature extraction creates new features from functions of the original features, whereas feature selection returns a subset of the features from the dataset. On selecting the features, classification is performed for detecting the intrusion.","","978-9-3805-4415-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100415","Attribute Evaluator;Classification;Dimensional Reduction;Feature Extraction;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Intrusion Detection","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Search methods","data reduction;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","IDS;classifier combination;dimension reduction technique;feature selection;intrusion detection system","","0","","17","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the idea of filtering the traffic at the entrance door, by using firewalls and the like, is not completely successful, the use of intrusion detection systems should be considered to increase the defense capacity of an information system. This paper presents a NeuroC4.5 based approach to network intrusion detection to detect anomalies in the computer networks. Decision tree is with good comprehensibility while neural network is with strong generalization ability. So, these merits are integrated into a novel decision tree algorithm NeuroC4.5. The NeuroC4.5 is employed to derive a set of classification rules from network audit data. The generated rules are then used to detect network intrusions in a real-time environment.

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible. In the paper a performance of the evolved fuzzy classifiers with a classification accuracy of 92% is presented.","","978-1-4673-0088-9","","10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6272759","Fuzzy Logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection","","","","","0","","18","","","25-27 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, Web applications tend to be error prone and implementation vulnerabilities are readily and commonly exploited by attackers. The design of countermeasures that detect or prevent such vulnerabilities or protect against their exploitation is an important research challenge for the fields of software engineering and security engineering. In this paper, we focus on one specific type of implementation vulnerability, namely, broken dependencies on session data. This vulnerability can lead to a variety of erroneous behavior at runtime and can easily be triggered by a malicious user by applying attack techniques such as forceful browsing. This paper shows how to guarantee the absence of runtime errors due to broken dependencies on session data in Web applications. The proposed solution combines development-time program annotation, static verification, and runtime checking to provably protect against broken data dependencies. We have developed a prototype implementation of our approach, building on the JML annotation language and the existing static verification tool ESC/Java2, and we successfully applied our approach to a representative J2EE-based e-commerce application. We show that the annotation overhead is very small, that the performance of the fully automatic static verification is acceptable, and that the performance overhead of the runtime checking is limited.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2007.70742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359468","Data sharing;Reliability;Security;Security and Protection;Software/Program Verification;Web technologies;Web-based services","","Web services;programming languages","J2EE-based e-commerce application;JML annotation language;Web application vulnerabilities;provable protection;security engineering;session data dependencies;software engineering","","2","1","48","","","Jan.-Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Not all communications are credible and malpractice can arise anywhere, anytime. If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules. We show that this automated approach is effective in reducing the number of false alarms when compared to other widely used and maintained IDSs.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721565","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Application software;Computer security;Databases;Drives;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protocols;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;digital signatures;program verification","data mining algorithm;intrusion detection verification rule;malicious behavior;network traffic monitoring;signature-based network security","","3","","22","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks. The new stage of this research will take the mobility into account. So for, a group of algorithms have been created and correlated in parallel and serial configurations to present the proposed vision for NIDS.

Since these HTTP-GET requests have legitimate formats and are sent via normal TCP connections, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can not detect them. In this paper, we propose HTTP-GET flood detection techniques based on analysis of page access behavior. We propose two detection algorithms, one is focusing on a browsing order of pages and the other is focusing on a correlation with browsing time to page information size.

They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a framework for distributed detection of network intrusions based on a parametric model. The parametric model can explicitly reflect the distributions of different intrusion types and handle the mixed-attribute data naturally. Based on the model, we can generate an accurate global intrusion detector with a very low cost of communication among the distributed detection sites, and no sharing of original network data is needed.

However, most of the current security technologies do not provide early warnings about such attacks. This paper presents a Finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that uses an adaptive risk approach to predict multi-staged cloud attacks. The risk model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The attacks prediction model was integrated with our autonomous cloud intrusion detection framework (ACIDF) to raise early warnings about attacks to the controller so it can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments on DARPA 2000 dataset, the proposed prediction model has successfully fired the early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. This gives the auto response controller ample time to take preventive measures.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945297","Cloud computing;HMM;intrusion prevention;prediction of multi-staged attacks;risk assessment","Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Security;Sensors;Vectors","cloud computing;hidden Markov models;probability;risk analysis;security of data","ACIDF;DARPA 2000 dataset;LLDDoS1.0 attack;adaptive risk approach;auto response controller;autonomous cloud intrusion detection framework;cloud computing;cloud resources;cloud systems;early warning alerts;early warnings;finite state hidden Markov model;finite state hidden Markov prediction model;multistage attacks;multistaged cloud attack;occurrence probability;risk model;security risk;security technology;security threat","","1","","15","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A new ensemble-feature-selection framework for intrusion detection","Hai Thanh Nguyen; Franke, K.; Petrovic, S.","Norwegian Inf. Security Lab., Gjovik Univ.

A feature selection method is required to be general enough to find representative features from training data, which are then used for classifying test patterns. The situation where the features selected from the training data are quite different from the representative features of the testing data is called over-selecting. The main causes of the over-selecting phenomenon are: non-comprehensive consideration of statistical properties of the training data, heuristic search strategies for feature selection and small sample size of the data set for training. In this paper, we show the influence of the over-selecting phenomenon on the over-fitting phenomenon of machine learning algorithms. We propose a new framework to address principal causes of over-selecting and thus reduce the chance of over-fitting. Our new framework that we call Ensemble Feature Selection measure (EnFS), allows to consider many statistical properties of a given data set at the same time by combining many feature selection methods used in the filter model. From the chosen feature selection measures, a new combined measure is constructed. We also propose a new search algorithm that ensures the globally optimal feature subsets by means of the constructed measure. The new search approach is based on solving a mixed 0-1 linear programming (M01LP) problem by means of the branch-and-bound algorithm. In this M01LP problem, the number of constraints and variables is linear in the number of full set features. In order to evaluate the quality of our EnFS measure, we chose the design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) as a possible application. Experimental results obtained over the KDD CUP'99 benchmarking data set for IDS show that our EnFS measure is capable of reducing over-fitting by addressing over-selecting.","2164-7143","978-1-4577-1676-8","","10.1109/ISDA.2011.6121657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121657","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0–1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0–1 fractional programming","Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Polynomials;Programming;Testing;Training;Training data","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;pattern recognition;security of data;set theory;tree searching","EnFS measure;branch-and- bound algorithm;ensemble feature selection measures;globally optimal feature subsets;heuristic search strategy;intrusion detection system;linear programming problem;machine learning algorithm;noncomprehensive consideration;over fitting phenomenon;pattern recognition system;representative feature;statistical property;test pattern classification","","0","","15","","","22-24 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dissimilarity-based one-class classifiers (DBOCCs) are constructed on dissimilarity representations. Redundancy and relativity of the features cast little influence on the performance of DBOCCs. This paper proposes anomaly detection using DBOCCs with unsupervised learning approach. Several combinations of DBOCCs scheme have also been used.

Until now, no paper has studied how to mine content of traffic to generate signatures for an IDS. Our work allows people to find signatures of an intrusion easily and provides a third party IDS (for example, Snort) with candidate signatures.

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Particular areas of concern are the deliberate and intended actions associated with malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, or the compromise of networks, communications or other IT resources, of which the most harmful and difficult to detect threats are those propagated by an insider. However, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information, such as what is found in document control and management systems, are limited in scope and capabilities. In order to address this issue, this effort involves performing further research and development on the existing graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) system. GBAD discovers anomalous instances of structural patterns in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. Input to GBAD is a labeled graph in which entities are represented by labeled vertices and relationships or actions are represented by labeled edges between entities. Using the minimum description length (MDL) principle to identify the normative pattern that minimizes the number of bits needed to describe the input graph after being compressed by the pattern, GBAD implements algorithms for identifying the three possible changes to a graph: modifications, insertions and deletions. Each algorithm discovers those substructures that match the closest to the normative pattern without matching exactly.","","978-0-7695-3568-5","","10.1109/CATCH.2009.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804450","","Communication system security;Computer security;Control systems;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Pattern matching;Personnel;Terrorism","graph theory;pattern matching;security of data","insider threat detection;labeled graph-based anomaly detection system;labeled vertex;minimum description length principle;normative pattern matching;unauthorized access identification","","4","","8","","","3-4 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This type of attack not only blocks the ongoing communication in the network, but also causes the wireless nodes to exhaust their energy much earlier than expected. A significant number of malicious attacks against the security in wireless networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of DDoS attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. To increase the reliability of attack detection, it is necessary to provide enhanced detection mechanisms that can determine the actual cause of channel impact. To address this, we designed a fuzzy logic system to detection of exhaustion attacks in IEEE 802.1.5.4 MAC layer. It is an attack detection mechanism which uses an anomaly based approach and operates in a distributed manner and we can distinguish attack scenarios from the impact of traffic load on network behavior.

Intrusion detection, which aims at identifying and predicting network attacks, is a fast developing area that has attracted attention from both industry and academia. Technologies have been developed to detect network intrusions using theories and methods from statistics, machine learning, soft computing, mathematics, and many other fields. We have previously proposed multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and multiple criteria nonlinear programming (MCNP) models for two-group intrusion detection.

The 3rd ACS/IEEE International Conference on","20050613","2005","","","98","","Summary form only given. In the current research, we present an operation framework and protection mechanism to facilitate a secure environment to protect mobile agents against tampering. The system depends on the presence of an authentication authority. The advantage of the proposed system is that security measures are an integral part of the design, thus common security retrofitting problems do not arise. This is due to the presence of the ElGamal encryption mechanism to protect its confidential content and any collected data by the agent from the visited host. Therefore, eavesdropping on information from the agent no longer reveals any confidential information. Also, the inherent security constraints within the framework allow the system to operate as an intrusion detection system for any mobile agent environment. The mechanism is tested for most well known severe attacks against agents and networked systems. The scheme proved to have promising performance that highly recommends it for the type of transactions that needs highly secure environments, e. g., business to business.","","0-7803-8735-X","","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387089","","Authentication;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Protection;Software agents;System testing","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile agents","ElGamal encryption mechanism;MANET;authentication authority;confidential information;highly secure environments;intrusion detection;mobile agent protection mechanism;secure environment;security constraints;security retrofitting problems","","1","5","18","","","2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection is required as an additional wall for protecting systems despite of prevention techniques and is useful not only in detecting successful intrusions, but also in monitoring attempts to security, which provides important information for timely countermeasures. This paper presents some improvements to some of our previous approaches using a Non-negative Matrix factorization approach.

Comparing with other Intrusion Detection System, IDMTM can greatly decrease the possibility of false-alarm with by efficiently utilizing the information collected from the local node and the neighboring nodes.

Once a computer is compromised, an attacker may alter files, add new files or delete existing files. The changes that attackers make may target any part of the filesystem, including metadata along with files (e.g., permissions, ownerships and inodes). The accuracy of detecting an intrusion depends on the data audited: if an intrusion does not manifest in the data, the intrusion will not be detected. Moreover, not all files, which contain filesystem activity, are suitable to detect intrusions, as some may fail to provide useful information. In this paper, we describe an empirical study that focused on filesystem attack activity after a SSH compromise. Three types of attacker action are considered: reconnaissance, password modification, and malware download. For each type of action, we evaluated the files to audit using metrics derived from the field of information theory and estimated with the empirical SSH compromise data.","","978-0-7695-3698-9","978-0-7695-3698-9","10.1109/NCA.2009.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5190368","Intrusion detection systems;SSH compromise;attacker behavior;empirical analysis;filesystem data;honeypots","Application software;Computer applications;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Event detection;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Reconnaissance;Software tools;USA Councils","Bayes methods;authorisation;entropy;file organisation;invasive software;meta data;optimisation;probability","Bayesian metric;data auditing;empirical SSH compromise data;entropy-based metric;file evaluation;filesystem attack activity;filesystem data monitoring;honeypot;information theory;intrusion detection system;malware download;meta data;optimization problem;password modification;probability;reconnaissance action;unauthorized user","","0","","29","","","9-11 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common method used to rank the alerts is scoring function, the higher the score, the more risky of the alert. Our motivation is that many times user can not precisely specify the weights for the scoring function as their preference in order to produce the preferred order of results.

As IDS traces monitor large groups of servers, large amounts of network data and also spanning a variety of patterns, efficient analytical approaches are needed to address this big heterogeneous data analysis problem. We believe that using unsupervised learning methods can help to classify data that allows analysts to find out meaningful insights and extract the value of the collected data more precisely and efficiently. This study demonstrates how the technique of growing hierarchical self-organizing maps (GHSOM) can be utilized to facilitate efficient event data analysis. For the collected IDS traces, GHSOM is used to cluster data and reveal the geometric distances between each cluster in a topological space such that the attack signatures for each cluster can be easily identified. The experimental results from a real-world IDS traces show that our proposed approach can efficiently discover several critical attack patterns and significantly reduce the size of IDS trace log which needs to be further analyzed. The proposed approach can help internet security administrators/analysts to conduct network forensics analysis, discover suspicious attack sources, and set up recovery processes to prevent previously unknown security threats such as zero-day attacks.","","","","10.1109/BDCloud.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034762","cloud services;forensic analysis;growing hierarchical self-organizing map;internet security;intrusion detection system","Correlation;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;data analysis;digital signatures;pattern classification;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning","GHSOM;IDS traces;Internet security administrators;Internet security analysts;analytical approach;attack signatures;cloud services;cluster geometric distances;complex data pattern parsing;critical attack patterns;data classification;data clustering;event data analysis;event pattern discovery;growing hierarchical self-organizing maps;heterogeneous data analysis problem;intrusion detection rule sets;intrusion detection system;network forensics analysis;recovery process;suspicious attack source discovery;topological space;unsupervised learning methods","","0","","22","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected.

The system implements the detection algorithm as a Snort preprocessor component. Since they work together, a highly effective system against known attacks has been achieved (based on Snort rules) and a highly effective system against unknown threats (which was the main aim of the designed system). As the majority of such systems, the proposal consists of two phases: a training phase and a detection phase. During the training phase a statistical model of the legitimate network usage is created through Bloom Filters and N-grams techniques. Subsequently, the results obtained by analyzing a dataset of attacks are compared with such model. This will allow a set of rules to be developed which will be able to determine whether the packets payloads contain malware. In the detection phase, the traffic to analyze is compared with the model created in the training phase and the results obtained when applying rules. The performed experiments showed really satisfactory results, with 100% malware detection and just 0.15% false positives.","1548-0992","","","10.1109/TLA.2015.7069114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069114","Anomaly;Bloom Filter;IDS;Intrusion Detection System;Malware;N-Gram;NIDS;Network Intrusion Detection System;Payload;Preprocessor;Snort","Computer science;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Malware;Payloads;Silicon compounds;Training","invasive software;statistical analysis","N-grams technique;Snort preprocessor component;anomaly-based network intrusion detection system;bloom filter;detection phase;malware detection;network traffic;statistical model;training phase","","0","","","","","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
