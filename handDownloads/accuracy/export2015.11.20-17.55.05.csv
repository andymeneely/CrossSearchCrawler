Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful tool to solve classification problems. Many works have been done in intrusion detection based on SVM, and the detection accuracy is relatively high.

We first use GA for feature selection and optimization, and then use SVM model to detect intrusions.

Software vulnerability may jeopardize information confidentiality and cause software failure leading tocatastrophic threats to humans or severe economic losses. Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats. This paper is divided into two parts. It examines promising search based testing approaches to detecting software vulnerabilities, and then presents some of the most interesting open research problems.","","978-1-4244-4356-7","","10.1109/ICSTW.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976374","high dependability software;search based software testing;vulnerability exposure","Application software;Computer security;Costs;Data security;Humans;Production;Software performance;Software safety;Software systems;Software testing","data privacy;program testing;security of data","code breaking;computerized system security;cost-vulnerability problem;information confidentiality;pervasive problem;search based software testing;software failure;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","70","","","1-4 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy. We show the effectiveness of PBC when applying it to a large dataset.","","978-1-4673-7988-5","","10.1109/QRS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272921","Anomaly Detection Systems;Boolean Combination;Intrusion Detection Systems;Multiple-Detector Systems;Pruning Techniques","Accuracy;Boolean functions;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Monitoring;Probability distribution;Training","Boolean algebra;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS;PBC;anomaly detection system;intrusion detection system;machine learning technique;pruning Boolean combination;pruning technique","","","","","","","3-5 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This growth is mostly because of the popularity of the shared content and the great enhancement in the P2P protocol since it first came out with Napster. The shared files are generally both large and copyrighted. Motivated by the problems of UlakNet with the P2P traffic, we propose a novel method for P2P traffic-detection in the network backbone in this paper. Observing the similarity between detecting traffic that belongs to a specific protocol and detecting an intrusion in a computer system, we adopt an intrusion detection system (IDS) technique to detect P2P traffic. Our method is a passive detection procedure that uses traffic flows gathered from border routers.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to optimize the performance of image transfer from multiple sensor nodes to the Sink we propose a 2-hop neighborhood information- based cover set selection to determine the most relevant cover sets. Then, in order to be consistent with our proposed approach, a multi-path extension of Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (called T-GPSR) wherein routing decisions are also based on 2-hop neighborhood information is proposed. Simulation results show that our proposal reduces packet losses, enabling fast packet delivery and higher visual quality of received images at the Sink.","2156-9711","","","10.1109/WD.2013.6686505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686505","2-hop information;Image transmission;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN);mission-critical;multipath routing;quality of service (QoS)","Image sensors;Mission critical systems;Relays;Routing;Surveillance;Visualization;Wireless sensor networks","image sensors;quality of service;surveillance;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","2-hop neighborhood information;T-GPSR;WISN;application criticality level;cover set selection;disaster response;greedy perimeter stateless routing;image transfer;intrusion detection;mission-critical surveillance;multipath extension;node activity;packet delivery;quality of service;routing decisions;sensor nodes;sentry nodes;visual quality;wireless image sensor networks","","2","","33","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To provide secure and reliable services in cloud computing environment is an important issue. One of the security issues is how to reduce the impact of denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) in this environment. To counter these kinds of attacks, a framework of cooperative intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed. The proposed system could reduce the impact of these kinds of attacks. To provide such ability, IDSs in the cloud computing regions exchange their alerts with each other. In the system, each of IDSs has a cooperative agent used to compute and determine whether to accept the alerts sent from other IDSs or not. By this way, IDSs could avoid the same type of attack happening. The implementation results indicate that the proposed system could resist DoS attack. Moreover, by comparison, the proposed cooperative IDS system only increases little computation effort compared with pure Snort based IDS but prevents the system from single point of failure attack.","1530-2016","978-1-4244-7918-4","978-0-7695-4157-0","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599084","cloud computing;cooperative intrusion detection system;denial-of-service attack;distributed denial-of-service attack","Cloud computing;Clouds;Computer crime;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Simulation","Internet;security of data;software agents","DoS attack;Internet;cloud computing networks;cloud computing region exchange;cooperative IDS system;cooperative agent;cooperative intrusion detection system framework;distributed denial-of-service attack","","20","1","10","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Approaches for an automated re-use of design and modeling decisions of available signatures also do not exist. In this paper we present an approach for systematic engineering of signatures which is based on the re-use of existing signatures. It exploits similarities with known attacks for the engineering process. The method applies an iterative abstraction of signatures.

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-0989-9","978-1-4673-0988-2","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic","","5","","15","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","4","2","47","","2009-08-11","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131","IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow","Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN","","3","","16","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inefficiency is often attributed to high overhead and this is caused by several reasons. Among them are continuous detection and the use of full feature set to look for intrusive patterns in the network packet. The purpose of this paper are; to address the issue of continuous detection by introducing traffic monitoring mechanism and a lengthy detection process by selectively choose significant features to represent a network connection. In traffic monitoring, a new recognition paradigm is proposed in which it minimizes unnecessary recognition. Therefore, the purpose of traffic monitoring is two-folds; to reduce amount of data to be recognized and to avoid unnecessary recognition.

Fuelled by recent advances in networking, communications, computation, software, and hardware technologies, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is considered as the next breakthrough technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. However, realising a network of physical objects accessed through the Internet brings a potential threat in the shadow of the numerous benefits. The threat is “security”. Given that Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) leverage the potential of IoT quite efficiently, this paper faces the challenge of security attention on a particular, yet broad, context of IP-enabled WSNs. In particular, it proposes a novel threat visualisation tool for such networks, called VisIoT. VisIoT is a human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system that is capable of monitoring and promptly detecting several devastating forms of security attacks, including wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. Based on a rigorous, radial visualisation design, VisIoT may expose adversaries conducting one or multiple concurrent attacks against IP-enabled WSNs. The system's visual and anomaly detection efficacy in exposing complex security threats is demonstrated through a number of simulated attack scenarios.","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247576","","Data visualization;Engines;Monitoring;Routing;Security;Visualization;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;data visualisation;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IP-enabled WSN;Internet of Things;IoT systems security;Sybil attacks;VisIoT;complex security threats;concurrent attacks;hardware technologies;human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system;physical objects;radial visualisation design;security attacks;simulated attack scenarios;software technologies;threat visualisation tool;visual detection efficacy;wireless sensor networks;wormhole attacks","","","","11","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn. It is essential that an IPTV provider be able to monitor the QoE with minimal overhead.

Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes. Moreover, it achieves close to the linear speedup by improving the intrusion detection and false alarm rates.","","978-1-4799-0453-2","978-1-4799-0452-5","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557670","","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Particle swarm optimization;Testing;Vectors","computer network security;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering","MapReduce intrusion detection system;anomaly fragments discover;commodity hardware;computer networks;false alarm rates;initial cluster centroids;large data sets;particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm;premature convergence;sensitivity problem","","2","","20","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a ""unsafe zone"" to isolate user's SQL queries from a ""safe zone"" of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones.

Our goal is to develop methodologies by which sites receiving such probes can infer-using purely local observation-information about the probing activity: What scanning strategies does the probing employ? Is this an attack that specifically targets the site, or is the site only incidentally probed as part of a larger, indiscriminant attack? Our analysis draws upon extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including properties, such as trend, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. In addition, we design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) as inferred from the limited local view of a honeynet.

In this paper, we use a centroid-based technique for network intrusion detection in which the centroid is constructed on the basis of diversity.

Efficient NIDS can be developed by defining a proper rule set for classifying network audit data into normal or attack patterns. Generally, each dataset is characterized by a large set of features, but not all features will be relevant or fully contribute identifying an attack. Since different attacks need different subsets to have better detection accuracy, this paper describes an improved feature selection algorithm to identify most appropriate subset of features for a certain attack. The proposed method is based on MAHALANOBIS Distance feature ranking and an improved exhaustive search to choose a better combination of features.

Security attributes in conjunction with genetic algorithm jointly optimizes the placement of monitoring nodes (i.e., LMN) by dynamically evaluating node fitness by profiling workloads patterns, packet statistics, utilization data, battery status, and quality-of-service compliance.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199399","","Battery charge measurement;Communication system security;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;USA Councils;Wireless sensor networks","communication complexity;genetic algorithms;mobile radio;quality of service;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","battery status;genetic algorithm;local monitoring node;malicious attack;network threat;packet statistics;quality-of-service compliance;reduced complexity intrusion detection;resource constrained multihop mobile sensor network;security attribute;trusted proxy agent;utilization data;workloads pattern","","2","","18","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By contrast, anomaly detection systems learn the normal behavior of the system and monitor its activity to detect any deviations from the normal. Any such deviations are flagged as anomalous. This paper presents an anomaly detection system for web-based applications. The anomaly detection system monitors the attribute value pairs of successful HTTP requests received by webserver applications and automatically creates parameter profiles. It then uses these profiles to detect anomalies in the HTTP requests. Customized profiles help reduce the number of false positives.

This paper shows that this lack of state information requires an additional metric (The exchange timeout window) for detection of WLAN Denial of Service Probe Flood attacks. Variability in this metric has a significant influence on the ability of a detection system to reliably detect the presence of attacks. A parameter selection method is proposed which is shown to provide reliability and repeatability in attack detection in WLANs.

Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the vulnerability and the performance of RPL under these internal security threats.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755045","","Accuracy;Communication system security;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;cryptography;personal area networks;routing protocols;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN standard;DIS attack;Internet;control overhead;cryptography keys;delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;internal security threats;local repair attack;lossy network performance;low power network;neighbour attack;rank attack;routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","0","","7","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This new approach proposes to prevent fraud before initial use of a new card, even users without any real transaction data. This approach shows potential, nevertheless, there are some problems needed solving. A main issue is how to predict accurately with only few data, since it collects quasi-real transaction data via an online questionnaire system and thus respondents are commonly unwilling to spend too much time to reply questionnaires. This study employs both support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to investigate the time-varying fraud problem. The performance of ANN is compared with that from SVM. Results show that SVM and ANN are comparable in training but ANN can have highest training accuracy. However, ANN seems to overfit training data and thus has worse performance of predicting the future data when data number is small","","0-7803-9422-4","","10.1109/ICNNB.2005.1614747","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1614747","","Artificial neural networks;Computer science;Consumer behavior;Credit cards;Engineering management;Logistics;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Technology management;Training data","credit transactions;fraud;neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","artificial neural networks;credit card fraud prevention;online questionnaire system;personalized approach;quasi-real transaction data;support vector machines;time-varying fraud problem","","4","","27","","","13-15 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Black hole attacks are potentially devastating attacks on wireless sensor networks in which a malicious node uses spurious route updates to attract network traffic that it then drops. We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic. We examine the resource-preserving mechanisms of our system using simulations and demonstrate that we can allow groups of nodes to collectively evaluate network traffic and identify attacks while respecting the limited hardware resources (processing, memory and storage) that are typically available on wireless sensor network nodes.","","","","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835013","","Cryptography;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","autonomous self-organizing low-power nodes;black hole attacks;flexible attack detection scheme;lightweight expert system;malicious node;network traffic;node-resident expert systems;resource-preserving mechanisms;spurious route updates;watchdog mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","0","","20","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible.

Despite many of these machine learning approaches have achieved the goal of getting high accuracy levels in a more automatic way, the fact is that only a few of them have actually been deployed on real life scenarios. This could be explained if we take into consideration that some of the assumptions in which these techniques rely on, do not easily hold. Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels. Prototype relays on a hybrid detection and evolutionary summarizing schemes The viability of the two schemes has been confirmed trough experiments considering different attack distributions and types.","","978-1-4799-1426-5","","10.1109/IDAACS.2013.6663006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663006","Genetic Algorithms;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Sociology;Statistics","computer network security;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","attack distributions;attack types;evolutionary summarizing scheme;human effort reduction;hybrid detection scheme;machine learning techniques;network intrusion detection;network traffic model generation;prototype relays","","0","","13","","","12-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many works have been carried out for the past several years targeting different goals including Quality-of-Service support, security, management, and provisioning. However, these approaches are developed and evaluated separately without a general model that can be used to identify, categorize, and compare them. Thus, it is difficult for a newcomer to understand the principle of flow classification and to find a suitable method for her domain. This paper brings forth a mathematical model that describes the flow classification components and processes on an abstract level.

Virtualization has a key role in supporting the IaaS model. However, virtualization also makes it a target for potent rootkits because of the loss of control problem over the hosted Virtual Machines (VMs). This makes traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operating system kernel trustworthiness, no longer an effective solution to secure the virtual infrastructure of the IaaS model. In this paper, we explore briefly the security problem of the IaaS cloud computing model, and present CloudSec, a new virtualization-aware monitoring appliance that provides active, transparent and real-time security monitoring for hosted VMs in the IaaS model. CloudSec utilizes virtual machine introspection techniques to provide fine-grained inspection of VM's physical memory without installing any monitoring code inside the VM. It actively reconstructs and monitors the dynamically changing kernel data structures instances, as a prior step to enable providing protection for kernel data structures. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype using VMsafe libraries on a VMware ESX platform. We have evaluated the system monitoring accuracy and the performance overhead of CloudSec.","","978-1-4577-0458-1","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059967","Cloud Computing;IaaS Security;Semantic Gap;VMsafe APIs;VMware ESX;Virtual Appliance;Virtual Machine Introspection","Data structures;Kernel;Memory management;Monitoring;Security;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;data structures;operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","CloudSec;VM physical memory;VMsafe libraries;VMware ESX platform;fine grained inspection;in-guest security solutions;infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing model;kernel data structures;operating system kernel trustworthiness;security monitoring appliance;virtual machine introspection techniques;virtualization;virtualization aware monitoring appliance","","10","","27","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper details a Human Interface for Security Awareness (HISA) algorithm for interpreting cyber incident information to human operators from anomaly based intrusion detections systems. A similarity algorithm mapping anomaly results to signature based intrusion system rules is developed. Categorizations of attacks found in rules created for the Snort intrusion system were used as a basis of information to present to the user. A proof of concept system was developed using Perl native functions and custom modules. Testing with generated ICMP packets resulted in an identification accuracy of 60% proving the efficacy of the presented HISA algorithm.","","978-1-4244-3959-1","978-1-4244-3960-7","10.1109/HSI.2009.5091055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5091055","command and control systems;site security monitoring","Communication system control;Communication system security;Computer security;Control systems;Humans;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Safety","digital signatures;security of data;traffic information systems;user interfaces","cyber security anomaly detection system;digital signature;human interface;intrusion detection system;network traffic information system;security awareness;snort intrusion system;user interface","","1","","18","","","21-23 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such deployments, availability poses a serious challenge. Without proper security mechanisms, networks will be confined to limited, controlled environments, negating much of the promise they hold. Due to its architecture, it suffers from various types of denial of service attacks like collision attacks, packet dropping and misdirection. Denial of Service attacks affects the availability of network and prevents legal nodes to use the network services. In this paper, we propose a framework for designing Intrusion Detection Systems to defend against denial of Service attacks.

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504","Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security","Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip","firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests","","0","","28","","2015-06-23","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
