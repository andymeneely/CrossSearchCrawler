Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Apart from strong encryption, there is no definite method of truly securing network, thus they must be protected at different levels of the OSI model. At the physical layer, they can be protected by lock-and-key, and at the data link, they can be protected within VLANS (virtual LANs). With the network and transport layers, networks can be secured by firewalls, which monitor source and destination network addresses, and source and destination ports, respectively. At the session level, user names and passwords are be used. Unfortunately, all these methods can be prone to methods which can overcome the protection used. This paper expands the research previously undertaken on a misuse system based on the intelligent agent software technology. The system monitors user actions in real-time and take appropriate actions if necessary. Along with this our system uses a short-term prediction to predict the user behaviour and advises the system administrator accordingly, before the actual actions take place. This paper presents new results, which are based on an increased number of users.

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

This updating is achieved through the weights of the neighboring neurons. Based on the domain knowledge of network data (network packets) the SOM/FCM combination presents quantitative and qualitative matching correspondences which in turn reduce the number of suspicious neurons i.e. reduce the number of false alerts.

Such techniques are not constructed based on the understanding of EEG and brain functions, neither inspired by the understanding of emotional dynamics. Hence, the features are difficult to be interpreted and yield low classification performance. In this study, a new feature extraction technique using Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is proposed. The features are extracted from the weights of data-driven self-organizing feature map that are adjusted during training to optimize the error obtained from the desired output and the calculated output. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is then employed to perform classification on fear, happiness, sadness and calm emotions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of classifying emotions from EEG signals captured on 12 children aged between 4 to 6 years old ranging from 84.18% to 89.29%. In addition, classification performance for features derived from other techniques such as Power Spectrum Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are also presented as a standard benchmark for comparison purpose. It is observed that the proposed approach is able to yield accuracy of 33.77% to 55% as compared to the respective comparison features. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach has potential for comparative emotion recognition accuracy when coupled with MLP.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836608","CMAC;EEG;emotion classification;feature extraction;latent features","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Training","cerebellar model arithmetic computers;electroencephalography;emotion recognition;feature extraction;multilayer perceptrons;self-organising feature maps;signal classification","CMAC;EEG signals;KDE;MFCC;MLP classifier;Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;PSD;calm emotion;cerebellar model articulation controller;classification performance;computational cerebellar model;data-driven self-organizing feature map;emotion classification;emotion recognition accuracy;fear emotion;feature extraction;happiness emotion;kernel density estimation;multilayer perceptron classifier;power spectrum density;sadness emotion","","0","","28","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","15","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network.","","0-7803-9477-1","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532065","","Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Data analysis;Data security;Data visualization;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","information visualization;intrusion detection analysis;packet-level analysis;time-based network traffic visualizer;visual network traffic analysis","","11","","27","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this problem, we propose SMURFEN: a Rule Sharing intrusion detection network, which provides a platform for IDS users to effectively share their customized detection knowledge in an IDS community. An automatic rule propagation mechanism is proposed based on a decentralized two-level optimization problem formulation.

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once sensor nodes are compromised, malicious nodes can send erroneous data to the base station, and possibly mislead monitoring results and influence the whole networks' effectiveness. We need to find new mechanisms to protect the wireless networks from attacks. In this paper we develop a scheme for malicious node detection based on weighted-trust evaluation. A weight value is assigned to each sensor node initially. It updates every cycle if the node sends different report from the others. A malicious node will be detected when its weight value is lower than a threshold value. The simulation results show that our approach is more effective in detecting malicious nodes with lower misdetection ratio compared with existing schemes.","1976-0035","978-1-4244-8813-1","","10.1109/ICUT.2010.5677764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677764","","Base stations;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Simulation;Time factors;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","improved intrusion detection;malicious node detection;weighted trust evaluation;wireless sensor networks","","2","","15","","","16-18 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches.

In this paper, we have identified the limitations of the current techniques and propose a model for alert correlation that overcomes the shortcomings. An improved ""require/provide"" model is presented which established a cooperation between statistical and knowledge-based model, to achieve higher detection rate with the minimal false positives. A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs. The proposed model has been implemented in real-time and has successfully generated security events on establishing a correlation between attack signatures. The system has been evaluated to detect one of the most serious multi-stage attacks in cyber crime -- SQLIA (SQL Injection Attack). Typical SQLIA steps are analyzed within the realm of simulated malicious activities normally used by cyber criminals. The system has efficiently established a correlation in attack behaviors and has generated an attack map.

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection scheme based on a learning process, so that the training data can be updated at particular time intervals.

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application. A proprietary medium access control is developed based on the low-power SimpliciTI radio stack.

We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","5","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firewall along is not able to protect the system from being attacked through normal service channel. Furthermore, most of the current intrusion detection system focuses on the border of organization network.

To solve this problem, a technique called frequent episode rules (FERs) base on data mining has been introduced into anomaly detection system (ADS). These episode rules are used to distinguish anomalous sequences of TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections from normal traffic episodes. Unfortunately, this technique is so depend on the machine learning that we may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal traffic data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for Internet anomaly detection with weighted fuzzy matching over frequent episode rules.

In this vulnerability detection and restoration system, which restoration mechanism adopts ant colony optimization can reduce the vulnerability. In this transaction takes place first, at that time if any vulnerable presents it denotes that the file presents with worms and it specifies the worm in which stage. The stages are stable, vulnerable presence, exploit and zombie. By using this we can easily identify the worms and it can be detected. Intrusion detection method performs a major task. First vulnerability scanning is an activity, second is selecting infection targets, and our system detects the vulnerable and restore the activities. By performing this action our file can be transferred in securable manner.","","978-1-4799-4191-9","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6993115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993115","Computer Emergency Response;Intrusion Detection System;MAVDRS;Vulnerability detection","Ant colony optimization;Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","ant colony optimisation;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks","MAVDRS;ant colony optimization;computer emergency response;intrusion detection system;mobile adhoc networks;mobile vulnerability detection and restoration;multiple mobile agent technologies;optimized secured service selection;targeted hosts;transactions terminal","","0","","17","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our AEC includes two stages: the online stage and the offline stage, and three phases: classifier updating, ensemble classifiers reconstruction and component classifier subset selection for final decision. We take a new online bagging classification model that is based on incremental learner such as Naive Bayes classifier and can keep enough history information and create good diversity between different component classifiers. Then we take an offline scheme to do the ensemble reconstruction and ensemble subset selection: that is to drop certain number of classifiers periodically and use only a portion of the whole ensemble, the combination of which may yield better accuracy to make classification.

As to the former, the algorithm of sequential pattern discovery, WINEPI, is introduced to implement interactive knowledge discovery so as to mine frequent sequential patterns, of intrusion behavior from historical intrusion, event dataset. A novel idea of correlating discovered short sequential patterns based on intrusion prerequisite and intrusion intention is proposed to build long sequential patterns. As to the on-line part of intrusion behavior forecast system, it employs inference engine developed in this paper to forecast intrusion behavior based on intrusion preludes and to discover forecast rules. This system changes passive data storage into active data usage and helps to achieve active defense.

As a result of this paradigm shift, many key concerns such as the transparency of data transfer and access within the cloud, and the lack of clarity in data ownership were surfaced. To address these concerns, we propose a new way of approaching traditional security and trust problems: To adopt a detective, data-centric thinking instead of the classical preventive, system-centric thinking. While classical preventive approaches are useful, they play a catch-up game; often do not address the problems (i.e. data accountability, data retention, etc) directly. In this paper, we propose a data-centric, detective approach to increase trust and security of data in the cloud. Our framework, known as TrustCloud, contains a suite of techniques that address cloud security, trust and accountability from a detective approach at all levels of granularity. TrustCloud also extends detective techniques to policies and regulations governing IT systems.","","978-1-4244-9276-3","","10.1109/DSR.2011.6026885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026885","TrustCloud framework;accountability;cloud computing;cloud computing security;data-centric logging;trust","Business;Cloud computing;Google;History;Security;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;security of data;system monitoring","IT systems;TrustCloud;cloud computing security;cloud computing trust;cloud security;computing services;data access;data accountability;data ownership;data retention;data transfer;data-centric logging-accountability;data-centric thinking;security of data;system-centric logging-accountability","","8","","13","","","3-5 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to obtain good accuracy in the evaluation, very large datasets should be considered. Intrusion traffic and normal traffic are in general dependent on a large number of network characteristics called features. However not all of these features contribute to the traffic characteristics. Therefore, eliminating the non-contributing features from the datasets, to facilitate speed and accuracy to the evaluation of machine learning techniques, becomes an important requirement. In this paper we suggest an approach which analyzes the intrusion datasets, evaluates the features for its relevance to a specific attack, determines the level of contribution of feature, and eliminates it from the dataset automatically. We adopt the Rough Set Theory (RST) based approach and select relevance features using multidimensional scatter-plot automatically. A pair-wise feature selection process is adopted to simplify. In our previous research we used KDD'99 dataset and validated the RST based approach. There are lots of redundant data entries in KDD'99 and thus the machine learning techniques are biased towards most occurring events. This property leads the algorithms to ignore less frequent events which can be more harmful than most occurring events. False positives are another important drawback in KDD'99 dataset. In this paper, we adopt NSL-KDD dataset (an improved version of KDD'99 dataset) and validate the automated RST based approach. The approach presented in this paper leads to a selection of most relevance features and we expect that the intrusion detection research using KDD'99-based datasets will benefit from the good understanding of network features and their influences to attacks.","1091-0050","978-1-4673-1374-2","","10.1109/SECon.2012.6196965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196965","NSL-KDD dataset;Rough Set Theory;intrusion detection;labeled datasets;relevance feature selection","Approximation methods;Cleaning;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory;security of data","KDD'99-based datasets;NSL-KDD dataset;automated RST based approach;data cleaning;intrusion detection system;intrusion traffic;machine learning technique;multidimensional scatter-plot;network characteristics;network features;noncontributing feature;pairwise feature selection process;redundant data entries;relevance feature selection;rough set theory","","1","","17","","","15-18 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection models are used to detect the attacks based on the patterns and alerts in case of intruders are being met with the system. In this paper, we propose and implement intrusion-detection system grounded on artificial neural network model such as Self-Organizing Map (SOM) based competitive network, which in turn plays a vital role in detection of malicious nodes based on input data patterns. The proposed model deals with different types of attacks and their detection approach based on SOM model. The approach aids at increasing Detection rate as well as reducing the False alarm rate, which in turn helps to detect those attacks before it makes larger damage to the network and prevent them with supportive techniques and increase the network performance.

Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2","978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured.

Two key observations facilitate the model formulation: first, different anomaly detectors have different detection coverage and blind spots; second, diverse operating environments provide different kinds of information to reveal anomalies. After formulating the cooperation between basic detectors as a partially observable Markov decision process, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to search in an optimal cooperation manner, with the objective to achieve broader detection coverage and fewer false alerts. Furthermore, the coordinator's behavior can be adjusted easily by setting a reward signal to meet the diverse demands of changing system situations.

Experimental results show that the novel model and its algorithm quickens the affinity maturation process of detector population and stably increases the detection rate along with increasing evolutionary generation; but in Kim's conceptual mode, the affinity maturation process of detector population takes more time, the detection rate falls into a little degradation and maintains invariant for a long time.","","978-1-4244-3893-8","978-1-4244-3894-5","10.1109/IWISA.2009.5073094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5073094","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Degradation;Detectors;Evolutionary computation;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Vaccines","artificial immune systems;evolutionary computation;security of data","affinity maturation process;artificial immune model;detector population;immune evolutionary algorithm;negative selection algorithm;network intrusion detection;vaccine operator","","0","","13","","","23-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rough set can reduce dimensions of attributes and filter some invasion behaviors which are esay to identify. Secondly, less attributes selected by RS are input FSVM to train and classify, this method can improve operational speed of FSVM. For this model, FSVM uses an effective Fuzzy Membership Function based on the affinity among sample points to select an appropriate fuzzy membership to reduce the effects of outliers. Finally, Experimental results will show that the RS-FSVM performs the best recognition ability, indicating that RS-FSVM can serve as a promising model for intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4244-9855-0","978-1-4244-9857-4","10.1109/ISA.2011.5873410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5873410","","Accuracy;Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Training","fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;information filtering;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","FSVM preprocessor;fuzzy membership function;fuzzy support vector machine;information security;intrusion detection system;invasion behavior;rough set theory","","0","","12","","","28-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding). In our proposed system, any intrusion activity will cause significant variations, thereby causing a large error, while a minor aberration in the variations (concept drift) w- ll not be immediately reported as alert.","","978-1-4577-1375-0","","10.1109/THS.2011.6107850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107850","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems;Concept Drift;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Engines;Entropy;Feedback control;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Kullback-Leibler divergence;ROC curve;adapting ROC thresholding;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;concept drift detection;concept-drifting data stream mining;control theoretic model;entropy measurement scheme;feedback control engine;incremental anomaly based detection;network attack;normal traffic pattern profile;receiver operating characteristic curve;supervised machine learning;support vector machine based classifier;user activity","","1","","21","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for detecting the presence of computer worms based on the computer's behavioral measures. In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms. In addition, ANN may be used to identify the most relevant, measurable, features and thus reduce the feature dimensionality.","","0-7803-9490-9","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247059","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716409","","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Classification tree analysis;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer worms;Laboratories;Magnetic heads;Software tools","decision trees;invasive software;neural nets;pattern classification","artificial neural networks;classifications techniques;computer worm detection;decision tree;k-nearest neighbors","","2","","26","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a security system that monitors computer systems and network traffic, analyze that traffic to identify possible security breaches and raise alerts. An IDS triggers thousands of alerts per day which is difficult for human users to analyze them and take appropriate actions. It is important to reduce the false alarm alerts, intelligently integrate and correlate them in order to present a high level view of the detected security issue to the administrator. In this paper an hybrid model has been proposed in which intrusion detection takes place with the help Dendritic Cell Algorithm and Dempester belief theory along with SVM classification algorithms.

A good security mechanism requires an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in order to monitor security breaches when the prevention schemes are circumvented. To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques. The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292933","","Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers)","computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet;classification task;entropy;features extraction;genetic-based rule learning technique;interval-based representation;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network attacks;network intrusion detection;network traffic;prevention schemes;reliable computer networks;secure computer networks;security breaches monitoring;security mechanism;statistical features;statistical rule learning approach;volume-based approach","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal, we formulate a repeated non-cooperative game between an attacker and a HIDS. The solution leads the HIDS to find the optimal number of objects that should be monitored and the corresponding monitored time. We study the case of multiple-step attack to gain more insight of the solution for this game model.

The business-push to these infrastructures stemming from the Cloud computing paradigm resulted in a more sophisticated concept of rent-a-technology that enabled a series of new-networked business models. This emerging digital globalization has not only raised the legal stakes and ownership concerns; but also highlight the need of providing effective security solutions. These security solutions should be able to scale the application requirements without undue performance and quality overheads to ensure security and privacy of data in the federated Cloud deployments. This paper presents a formal way of testing the impact of scalability and heterogeneity on the federated Cloud security services. The work presented in this paper aims to develop a mean of quantifying the impact on security functions under various operating conditions and parameters of federated Cloud deployments.

The intrusion detection rate of the transportation information security system is often affected by the structure parameter design of the support vector machine (SVM) model. Improper SVM model design may lead to a low detection precision. To overcome these problems, a new intrusion detection method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and SVM is proposed in this paper. The KPCA was adopted to obtain the useful features of the original data to eliminate the redundancy. Then the PSO was employed to optimize the training procedure of the SVM. Thus, satisfactory SVM model with good extendable ability was attained. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the KDD dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods, and thus is available for the transportation information security.","","978-1-4577-0855-8","","10.1109/PACCS.2011.5990290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990290","","Intrusion detection;Kernel;Optimization;Support vector machines;Transportation","particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines;transportation","KDD dataset;improved SVM model;intrusion detection;kernel principal component analysis;particle swarm optimization;support vector machine;transportation information security systems","","3","","8","","","17-18 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current systems implementing intrusion detection processes observe traffic at several data collecting points in the network but analysis is often centralized or partly centralized. These systems are not scalable and suffer from the single point of failure, i.e. attackers only need to target the central node to compromise the whole system. This paper proposes an anomaly-based fully distributed network intrusion detection system where analysis is run at each data collecting point using a naive Bayes classifier. Probability values computed by each classifier are shared among nodes using an iterative average consensus protocol. The final analysis is performed redundantly and in parallel at the level of each data collecting point, thus avoiding the single point of failure issue. We run simulations focusing on DDoS attacks with several network configurations, comparing the accuracy of our fully distributed system with a hierarchical one. We also analyze communication costs and convergence speed during consensus phases.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292913","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Convergence;Intrusion detection;Joints;Network topology;Training","Bayes methods;computer network security;pattern classification","DDoS attacks;anomaly-based fully distributed network intrusion detection system;consensus based network intrusion detection system;data collecting point;iterative average consensus protocol;naïve Bayes classifier;probability values","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Host and network security are getting more critical and more complex due to the diversified and evolved ways of attack form anyplace in Internet world. Most of the technologies been developed are focusing on protecting individual systems and limited scope of network by using different diagnosis and detection approaches. Both commercial and noncommercial solutions, called IDS (intrusion detection system), usually maintain their own proprietary databases by collecting detection patterns. In general, more patterns collected and more up-to-date of the databases surely increase the capabilities of their bundled IDS solutions. However, due to the coverage limitation and late awareness, there still have new growing uncovered breaches that single IDS would not be able to catch up. The reasons are two: 1) Any one proprietary IDS is incapable of collecting so many detection patterns daily brought up in Internet world. 2) Systems under certain proprietary IDS's protection are unable to get instant notification of new detection patterns, most of which are discovered by other IDSs. In order to reduce the risks of coverage limitation and time delay of new types of attack, a joint defense service framework is been proposed, which work as human nervous system to protect every nodes within the system at all.","","0-7803-7882-2","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297610","","Databases;Delay effects;Explosives;Humans;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Nervous system;Neurons;Protection","Internet;authorisation;database management systems;neural nets;safety systems","Internet connectivity;e-service;joint defense service framework;network intrusion detection system;neuron security;proprietary databases","","0","","5","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This will make cloud computing a potential target for cyber attacks. Most proposed security models for virtualization are working above virtualization on host OS. Almost all proposed cloud security models suffers from this problem in that these models have very limited control over virtualization. In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS.

In such a system, once some nodes have been compromised, the attack would be directed by the network topology because compromise of a node may cause the compromise of its neighbors. Furthermore, the attack could be crafty or stealthy, meaning that it would always try not to trigger the intrusion detection alarm of the networked system.
