Center, Singapore, Singapore","Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on","20130307","2013","4","1","47","55","The anticipated proliferation of cyber components for collecting information and controlling operations of smart grids increases their vulnerability to a variety of cyber attacks. For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","2","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most background modeling methods fail in the presence of intensity changes, because the model cannot handle sudden changes. A solution to this problem is to use intensity-robust features. Despite the changes of an edge's shape and position among frames, edges are less sensitive than a pixel's intensity to illumination changes. Furthermore, background models in the presence of moving objects produce ghosts in the detected output, because high quality models require ideal backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a robust statistical edge-segment-based method for background modeling of non-ideal sequences. The proposed method learns the structure of the scene using the edges' behaviors through the use of kernel-density distributions. Moreover, it uses segment features to overcome the shape and position variations of the edges. Hence, the use of segments gives us local information of the scene, and that helps us to predict the objects and background precisely. Furthermore, we accumulate segments to build edge distributions, which allow us to perform unconstrained training and to overcome the ghost effect. In addition, the proposed method uses adaptive thresholding (in the segments) to detect the moving objects. Therefore, this approach increases the accuracy over previous methods, which use fixed thresholds.","1051-8215","","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2242551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423877","Background modeling;edge-segments;motion detection;object detection","Adaptation models;Image edge detection;Integrated circuit modeling;Kernel;Lighting;Robustness;Shape","edge detection;image segmentation;image sequences","background dynamism;background modeling;intensity changes;kernel-density distributions;nonideal sequences;statistical edge-segment distributions","","4","","33","","2013-01-30","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Rule extraction methods create interpretable rule sets that act as classifiers. They have mostly been combined with already labeled data sets. This paper aims to combine unsupervised anomaly detection with rule extraction techniques to create an online anomaly detection framework. Unsupervised anomaly detection uses diffusion maps and clustering for labeling an unknown data set. Rule sets are created using conjunctive rule extraction algorithm.

CCSF divides n sequences into m groups and each group contains 20 sequences. Firstly, CCSF generates signatures for each group by adopting color coding and filters them. Then all reserved signatures are clustered to get rid of redundant substrings. In this approach, signature can be generated without any fragment in environments with noise, and it can be used in IDS (intrusion detection system) to detect polymorphic worm. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

In this paper we propose a lightweight protocol called DICAS that mitigates these attacks by detecting, diagnosing, and isolating the malicious nodes. DICAS uses as a fundamental building block the ability of a node to oversee its neighboring nodes communication. On top of DICAS, we build a secure routing protocol, LSR, which in addition supports multiple node-disjoint paths. We analyze the security guarantees of DICAS and use ns-2 simulations to show its effectiveness against three representative attacks. Overhead analysis is conducted to prove the lightweight nature of DICAS.","","0-7695-2369-2","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607562","control attack.;monitoring;neighbor;node-disjoint paths;secure routing;sensor network security","Analytical models;Application software;Biomedical monitoring;Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Data security;Intelligent networks;Military computing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","","control attack.;monitoring;neighbor;node-disjoint paths;secure routing;sensor network security","","17","2","40","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Lightweight Intrusion Alert Fusion System","Sheng Wen; Yang Xiang; Wanlei Zhou","Sch. of Inf.

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a novel exploration in addressing these problems from a survivable, inescapable and deployable point of view.","","978-1-4244-8335-8","978-0-7695-4214-0","10.1109/HPCC.2010.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587281","Alert fusion;Cache-based mechanism;Target oriented policy","","security of data;sensor fusion","Australian Honey-Pot;CAFS scheme;alert fusion mechanism;cache-based alert fusion scheme;intrusion alert fusion system;intrusion detection system","","4","","28","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. This approach will be used to set the rules for Backtracking to determine the intrusion characteristics then to implement the “ Deny All except allowed” policy rules for prevention. Combination of stream processing and backtracking is used to achieve this so-called Intrusion Prevention, so that in addition to detecting the existence of intrusion we do deny of intrusion as prevention.","","978-1-4577-1545-7","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2012.6188773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6188773","Data Stream;Frequent pattern mining;Intrusion Prevention","Analytical models;Maintenance engineering;Real time systems","computer network security;data mining","anomaly intrusion prevention system;backtracking rule;contemporary intrusion detection system;data source;high speed processing;intrusion characteristics;massive stream data processing;network model;online frequent item sets mining;prevention policy rule;stream data mining;time-sensitive sliding window;variable arrival rate","","0","","16","","","15-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.

This paper presents a new approach to detect anomaly behaviors in encrypted accesses with SSH2 protocol to network public servers such as http servers, ftp servers and database servers. In this approach, first the system extracts information from each SSH client, which is consist of transferred data size and time interval between messages. Second, the various actions are identified based on similarity of information. Finally, attacks are detected according to intrusion signatures, generated from the frequency of accesses and specifications of TCP traffic. This system dose not decipher private information, because it detect intrusion only by use of transferred data size and time interval between messages and does not require too many calculations, which are needed in common encrypted traffic analysis methods, before start operation.

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign.

This paper studies this property by testing 356 severe attacks on the SNIDS Snort, configured with an old official rule set. Of these attacks, 183 attacks are zero-days' to the rule set and 173 attacks are theoretically known to it. The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection). The detection rate is however on overall greater for theoretically known attacks (a mean of 54% detection). The paper then investigates how the zero-days' are detected, how prone the corresponding signatures are to false alarms, and how easily they can be evaded. Analyses of these aspects suggest that a conservative estimate on zero-day detection by Snort is 8.2%.","","","","10.1109/HICSS.2014.600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6759203","Computer security;NIDS;code injection;exploits","Computer architecture;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Reliability;Servers;Software;Testing","computer network security;digital signatures","SNIDS;false alarm;signature based network intrusion detection;zero day attacks;zero day detection","","0","","21","","","6-9 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results are properly substantiated for better effectiveness, system security and flexibility.","","978-1-4673-5832-3","","10.1109/ACSAT.2012.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516336","Anomaly Detection;Change Detection;Network Intrusion;Outlier Detection;Performance Evaluation;Threshold Algorithms","","data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;SVM;change detection algorithm;change point outlier detection method;classification error;data analysis;data collection;data exchange;data mining;distributed solution procedure;false alarm rate minimization;frequently changing trend identification;information exchange;intelligence building;intelligent subsystem;intrusion detection analysis;learning;network data;network security;real time intrusion detection system;registration error;support vector machine;system security;timely detection","","0","","18","","","26-28 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance. Experimental results confirm that the framework demonstrated a significant improvement in three unsupervised intrusion detection algorithms.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680854","Classifier combination;False positive rate;Intrusion Detection;SCADA;Security","Accuracy;Data models;Intrusion detection;Protocols;SCADA systems;Testing","SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;security of data;unsupervised learning","DNP3;Ethernet/IP;MODBUS;SCADA systems;critical infrastructures;data injection;electricity generation;gas production;oil production;public networks;standard protocols;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unsupervised intrusion detection technique;unsupervised learning algorithms;water treatment","","1","","41","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is focused on multiclass classification of malicious Web activities using three supervised machine learning methods: J48, PART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The empirical analysis is based on data collected in duration of nine months by a high interaction honey pot consisting of a three-tier Web system, which included Web 2.0 applications (i.e., a blog and wiki). Our results show that supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish among multiple vulnerability scan and attack classes, with high recall and precision values for all but several very small classes. For our dataset, decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform slightly better than SVM in terms of overall accuracy and weighted recall. Additionally, J48 and PART require less than half of the features (i.e., session attributes) used by SVM, as well as they execute much faster.

The hindrance of such attacks is entirely dependent on their detection. The detection is a major part of any security tool such as intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), adaptive security alliance (ASA), check points and firewalls. Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing. The system uses sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms. The developed system is applied to different probing attacks. Furthermore, its performance is compared to other neural networks' approaches and the results indicate that our approach is more precise and accurate in case of false positive, false negative and detection rate.","","978-1-4244-4681-0","978-1-4244-4683-4","10.1109/ISIEA.2009.5356382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356382","Dataset;Detection Rate;False Negative;False Positive;Learning;Multiple Layered Perceptron;Neural Network;Probing attack;Remote to User;Resilient Backpropagation;User to root","Adaptive systems;Application software;Artificial neural networks;Backpropagation;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","adaptive security alliance;artificial neural network;computer network systems;cyber attack;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multiple layered perceptron;probing attacks detection;supervised neural network","","2","","27","","","4-6 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we present a decentralized monitor-based IDS for detecting jamming type denial of service (DoS) attacks at the lower layers of the protocol stack. The varying channel and network dynamics in ad hoc networks can impair service similar to a jamming scenario, resulting in false positives on intrusion detections. To this end, we incorporate a cross-layer design in our IDS to differentiate the malicious jamming behavior from genuine network failures.

To achieve these goals, several papers have explored the concept of mutual revocation (sometimes termed suicide) wherein the trust value of both the accuser and the accused node are temporarily set to zero without involving a quorum. In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.","","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971","Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing","Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority","","1","","18","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems.

The IDSaaS can be roughly classified into two types: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison. We further conduct a study to evaluate this mechanism under a cloud scenario and identify several open problems and issues for designing such a privacy-preserving mechanism for IDSaaS in a practical environment.","","","","10.1109/INCoS.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630405","Cloud Environment;IDSaaS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Privacy Preserving;Signature Matching","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Encryption;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads","cloud computing;data privacy;digital signatures","IDS-as-a-Service;IDSaaS;anomaly-based detection;cloud computing;cloud provider;fingerprint-based comparison;packet inspection;privacy concerns;privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism;privacy-preserving signature;signature matching process;signature-based detection","","0","","47","","","9-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.","","978-1-4244-1024-8","978-1-4244-1025-5","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451054","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal analysis;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless channels","WLAN security management;adaptive machine learning;anomaly-based behavior analysis;data mining;denial of service attack;genetic search;multichannel monitoring;network card;self-protection system;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network","","4","1","24","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Protecting these assets from frequently network attacks needs to deploy some distributed security systems. However the amount of data produced by many distributed security tools can be overwhelming. So it's very difficult and limited to get the most risky alert through manual process based on the huge network alerts with many attributes. The common method used to rank the alerts is scoring function, the higher the score, the more risky of the alert. Our motivation is that many times, user can not precisely specify the weights for the scoring function as their preference in order to get the preferable Ranking. In this paper, we propose a sampling method to mining user's preference. Based on this preference, the most risky alerts can be easily ranked for emergency response. An extensive performance study using both synthetic and real datasets is reported to verify its effectiveness and efficiency.","","978-1-4673-2630-8","","10.1109/DCABES.2012.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385278","Network Security Evaluation;Preference;Ranking;Sampling;Top K","Accuracy;Computer networks;Computers;Educational institutions;Sampling methods;Security;Vectors","data mining;information systems;sampling methods;security of data","distributed security systems;distributed security tools;emergency response;information system;network infrastructure;sampling method;scoring function;user preference mining","","0","","8","","","19-22 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the design of a new AIS algorithm and classifier system called simple AIS is described. It is different from traditional AIS classifiers in that it takes only one B-cell, instead of a B-cell pool, to represent the classifier.

It applies some special routing protocols, e.g. AODV, having the ability to forward the packets in dynamic network topology. The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the dropping traffic attack and after applying the developed HIDS is measured. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN technique reduces the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1110-6980","978-1-4244-4214-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233983","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized administration;dynamic network topology;mobile ad hoc network;multiple selfish nodes;network infrastructure;network performance;optimized network engineering tools;real-time host intrusion detection;routing protocol;routing traffic attack;secure protocol;simulated environment;wireless ad hoc AODV;wireless nodes","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these classifiers work offline, since full-flow statistics are not available until a flow is finished. Therefore, it is usually too late to take actions for online deployment. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to make these classifiers workable online. The idea is that different applications will show distinct traffic patterns from the very beginning of the flow, and so using statistics extracted from the first few packets can distinguish applications. Preliminary result shows that our method can achieve high flow accuracy, just a bit lower than using full-flow statistics. Using fewer packets per flow is promising, since it not only enables early classification and can easily apply to most of the existing classifiers, but also saves memory and computing power.","","978-0-7695-3336-0","","10.1109/CSSE.2008.911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4722720","machine learning;traffic classification","Computer science;Data engineering;Inspection;Machine learning;Payloads;Software engineering;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","data mining;machine learning;statistical flow;traffic classifiers online;traffic flows;traffic patterns","","2","","22","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an online data validation framework to verify home energy meters (EMs) in a secondary network with real-time measurements from feeder remote terminal units (FRTUs) in primary network. A potential cybertampering is identified based on three levels: 1) feeders; 2) subsystems; and 3) customers. This framework attempts to identify malicious consumers and their locations based on historical consumption pattern and network operating conditions in real time. The proposed framework is demonstrated to detect tampering activities using a realistic 12.47-kV distribution network. Results show that the data validation framework can accurately identify subsystems with tampered meters.

However, one of the most significant challenges in this area is the poor detection rate, due to the presence of excessive features in a data set whose class distributions are imbalanced. Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples. The best subset of features is then selected by a greedy search strategy.

Although many researches have been proposed to analyze attackers' behaviors to improve the detection rate, they still suffer in high false rate in intrusion detection. Therefore, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) deployment requires carefully planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training. So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data. Our experiment demonstrates that, although the false rate of integrated decision system is not the best of the four approaches discussed, the false rate is so low, its positive rate is the best one of these four, and its training time and decision time is so short that our approach is feasible for online.","","978-0-7695-3843-3","978-1-4244-5068-8","10.1109/MINES.2009.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371022","The proximal SVM;integrated;intrusion detection;system","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Filters;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Protection;Testing","security of data;support vector machines","data callback phase;data preprocessing phase;fusion decision phase;integrated decision system;intrusion detection","","0","","9","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these systems can generate a large number of alarms especially false alarms during their detection procedure, which is a big problem that decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of their detection. To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality. The experimental results show that by combining our defined ROC curve-based measure, namely relative expected cost, our developed filter can achieve a better outcome in the aspect of cost consideration.","2159-1547","978-1-4577-1778-9","","10.1109/CIMSA.2012.6269608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269608","Computational Intelligence;False Alarm Reduction;Intelligent Decision Support and Control Systems;Intrusion detection;Performance Measurement","Algorithm design and analysis;Equations;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Support vector machines","alarm systems;computer network security;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation","NIDS;ROC curve-based measure;cost analysis;decision quality;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network attacks;network environment;network intrusion detection system;single-algorithm performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","2-4 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Improving Effectiveness of Intrusion Detection by Correlation Feature Selection","Hai Nguyen; Franke, K.; Petrovic, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Media Technol., Gjovik Univ.

ARES '10 International Conference on","20100325","2010","","","17","24","The quality of the feature selection algorithm is one of the most important factors that affects the effectiveness of an intrusion detection system (IDS). Achieving reduction of the number of relevant traffic features without negative effect on classification accuracy is a goal that greatly improves the overall effectiveness of the IDS. Obtaining a good feature set automatically without involving expert knowledge is a complex task. In this paper, we propose an automatic feature selection procedure based on the filter method used in machine learning. In particular, we focus on Correlation Feature Selection (CFS). By transforming the CFS optimization problem into a polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming problem and by introducing additional variables in the problem transformed in such a way, we obtain a new mixed 0 - 1 linear programming problem with a number of constraints and variables that is linear in the number of full set features. The mixed 0-1 linear programming problem can then be solved by means of branch-and-bound algorithm. Our feature selection algorithm was compared experimentally with the best-first-CFS and the genetic-algorithm-CFS methods regarding the feature selection capabilities. The classification accuracy obtained after the feature selection by means of the C4.5 and the BayesNet machines over the KDD CUP'99 IDS benchmarking data set was also tested. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the best first and genetic algorithm search strategies by removing much more redundant features and still keeping the classification accuracies or even getting better performances.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438117","correlation-based feature selection;intrusion detection;mixed 0-1 integer linear programming;polynomial mixed 0-1 fractional programming","Classification algorithms;Computer vision;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Integer linear programming;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Machine learning;Polynomials;Testing","Bayes methods;correlation theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical programming;security of data;tree searching","Bayesnet machines;IDS;best-first-CFS;branch-and-bound algorithm;classification accuracy;correlation feature selection;expert knowledge;feature selection algorithm;filter method;fractional programming problem;genetic algorithm;improving effectiveness;intrusion detection systems;linear programming problem;machine learning;optimization problem;redundant features;traffic features","","8","","16","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Until now, PCA is basically applied to dimension reduction method. Several issues remain including: how effective can PCA be applied to semi-supervised models with a small training dataset, which components are significant for anomaly detection. This paper proposes a semi-supervised model using a modified Mahanalobis distance based on PCA for network traffic anomaly detection.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based applications can be very effectively used in military applications for detecting the landmines that are laid down by the enemy. Accurate mine detection in such application is very important otherwise it may lead to loss of life. Prompted by this we propose an adaptive sensor placement algorithm where sensor placement is dynamically determined based on existing mine concentration in a given area thus ensuring that sensors are localized in the region of higher mine concentration. We further use clustering algorithm for data aggregation from sensor nodes reported from high mine density region; this ensures optimum utilization of sensor batteries which is one of the major determinants in sensor lifetime and hence system reliability. Simulation is done for adaptive sensor deployment and data aggregation using cluster formation in areas of varying mine concentration to check the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4244-8678-6","978-1-4244-8679-3","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941593","A-means algorithm;Wireless sensor networks;adaptive sensor placement;cluster head;minimum spanning tree","Clustering algorithms;Fuel processing industries;Landmine detection;Mobile communication;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","intelligent sensors;landmine detection;military systems;wireless sensor networks","adaptive landmine detection algorithm;data aggregation;intelligent sensor deployment;military applications;wireless sensor network","","1","","23","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
