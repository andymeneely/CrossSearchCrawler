Selecting appropriate network features is one of the factors that influence the accuracy of SDC model. Past research has shown that the Hidden Marcov Chain, Genetic Algorithm, and the two-second time windows are among the best features selection methods for SDC Model. However this paper aims to improve the accuracy model by applying the features extraction based customized features. The customized features are the network data set which has been preprocessed through the following steps: removing biased attributes, discretized using chi-merge and remove the attributes with string value. The previous research applies the feature extraction based on all features. The best model is measured based on the detection rate, false alarm rate and number of rules using four data mining techniques such as Ripper(Jrip), Ridor, PART and decision three. The experiment is conducted using three random KDD-cup99 data sets. The result shows that the features extraction based on customized features has increased the accuracy model between 0.4% to 9% detection rates and reduced between 0.17% to 0.5% false alarm rates. The result shows the importance of data preprocessing in producing a high quality SDC Model.","","978-1-4244-8134-7","","10.1109/ISDA.2010.5687051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5687051","Data Mining;Features Selection;Genetic algorithm feature selection;JRip algorithm;Signature Detection","","data mining;decision trees;digital signatures;feature extraction;pattern classification;security of data","KDD-cup99 data sets;PART;Ridor;Ripper(Jrip);biased attribute removal;customized features;data mining;data preprocessing;decision three;detection rate;false alarm rate;features extraction;features selection;intrusion detection system;network security;security audit data set;signature detection classification model","","2","","18","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Range of node specifies detection systems in wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks have been projected by academicians, of late. In the existing approach Leader based intrusion detection system is used to find out suspect regions where the compromised nodes are ensconced, here the Leader will be elected region wise based on the energy level to detect the attacker and revoke the compromised node. To overcome this as well as to provide high security two new stage approaches are proposed.

To go into detail of the online systems, we have carefully analyzed some well-known, state-of-the-art steganalysis algorithms and estimated their processing power and memory requirements. Some formulas are derived to relate the network bit rate with the number of the processing units, their processing power, and memory size.

The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models.

The efficiency of an Intrusion detection system in the case of an adhoc network is not only determined by its dynamicity in monitoring but also in its flexibility in utilizing the available power in each of its nodes. In this paper we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system, based on a power level metric for potential adhoc hosts, which is used to determine the duration for which a particular node can support a network-monitoring node. The detection of intrusions in the network is done with the help of Cellular Automata (CA). IDFADNWCA (Intrusion Detection for Adhoc Networks with Cellular Automata) focuses on the available power level in each of the nodes and determines the network monitors. Power Level Metric in the network results in maintaining power for network monitoring, with monitors changing often, since it is an iterative power optimal solution to identify nodes for distributed agent based intrusion detection. The advantage of this approach entails is the inherent flexibility it provides, by means of considering only fewer nodes for reestablishing network monitors.","","978-0-7695-3489-3","","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737122","Adhoc Networks;Cellular Automata;Genetic Algorithms","Computer networks;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network topology;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Power system protection;Watches;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cellular automata;monitoring;telecommunication security","IDFADNWCA algorithm;cellular automata;distributed agent based intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;iterative power optimal solution;network-monitoring node;power level metric;wireless adhoc network","","0","","10","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More precisely, this paper shows how DDoS attacks can exhaust controller resources and provides a solution to detect such attacks based on the entropy variation of the destination IP address.

As control systems become increasingly complex, the number of inputs and outputs increase. Therefore, in order to maintain sufficient levels of state-awareness, a robust system state monitoring must be implemented that correctly identifies system behavior even when one or more sensors are faulty. Furthermore, as intelligent cyber adversaries become more capable, incorrect values may be fed to the operators. To address these needs, this paper proposes a fuzzyneural data fusion engine (FN-DFE) for resilient state-awareness of control systems. The designed FN-DFE is composed of a three-layered system consisting of: 1) traditional threshold based alarms; 2) anomalous behavior detector using self-organizing fuzzy logic system; and 3) artificial neural network-based system modeling and prediction. The improved control system stateawareness is achieved via fusing input data from multiple sources and combining them into robust anomaly indicators. In addition, the neural network-based signal predictions are used to augment the resiliency of the system and provide coherent state-awareness despite temporary unavailability of sensory data. The proposed system was integrated and tested with a model of the Idaho National Laboratory's hybrid energy system facility known as HYTEST. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed FNDFE provides timely plant performance monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities. It was shown that the system is capable of identifying intrusive behavior significantly earlier than conventional threshold-based alarm systems.","2168-2267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2323891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823672","Artificial neural networks;data fusion;fuzzy logic systems;resilient control systems;state-awareness","Artificial neural networks;Control systems;Monitoring;Robustness;Sensor systems;Vectors","control engineering computing;fuzzy neural nets;power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;sensor fusion","FN-DFE engine;HYTEST facility;Idaho National Laboratory;anomalous behavior detector;artificial neural network-based system;control system state-awareness;control systems;critical infrastructure;energy production system;enhanced resilient state-awareness;fuzzy-neural data fusion engine;hybrid energy systems;industrial system;intelligent cyber adversaries;neural network-based signal predictions;self-organizing fuzzy logic system;system modeling;system prediction;system state monitoring;threshold based alarms;threshold-based alarm systems","","3","","41","","2014-05-30","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A class of IDSs is based on clustering of network traffic into normal and abnormal according to some features of the connections. The selected distance function to measure the similarity and dissimilarity of sessions' features affect the performance of clustering based IDSs. The most popular distance metric, which is used in designing these IDSs is the Euclidean distance function. In this paper, we argue that more appropriate distance functions can be deployed for IDSs. We propose a method of learning an appropriate distance function according to a set of supervision information. This metric is derived by solving a semi-definite optimization problem, which attempts to decrease the distance between the similar, and increases the distances between the dissimilar feature vectors. The evaluation of this scheme over Kyoto2006+ dataset shows that the new distance metric, can improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) clustering based IDS in terms of normal detection and false positive rates.","","978-1-4799-8817-4","","10.1109/AISP.2015.7123497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7123497","Anomaly detection;Clustering Algorithms;Intrusion detection system;Metric learning","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Feature extraction;Measurement;Support vector machines;Training data","mathematical programming;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Euclidean distance function;Kyoto2006+ dataset;SVM clustering;SVM-clustering based intrusion detection system;clustering based IDS;dissimilar feature vector;distance metric;false positive rate;network security;network traffic;normal detection;semidefinite optimization problem;support vector machine clustering","","0","","14","","","3-5 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a component based method is proposed to analyze UDP traffic. Since flows in each component share the same application, P2P traffic can be identified without packet level information.","","978-1-4799-3649-6","","10.1109/ICICIP.2014.7010349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7010349","","IP networks;Internet;Peer-to-peer computing;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Punching;Servers","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Internet traffic;NAT traversal;Netflow based P2P detection;TCP;UDP traffic;component based method","","0","","23","","","18-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

At present the presence of such a potential threat agitates a greater and greater interest in various possibilities for enhancing its security. Currently exerted defence system based on the use of firewall, antivirus software and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) represents a necessary minimum. This traditional approach to security of computer systems is primarily oriented to the defence against already existing threats. It is essential to adapt the security system to this trend as the current threats have much more aggressive forms. The use of decoy based security technology - Honeypot - represents an adequate form of defence. However, even this technology is not a “security panacea” as its 100% functionality is proportionally dependent on the specific installation process. This article is focused on the technology called Honeypot and the issue of implementation process of its autonomous version, which is able to create virtual Honeypots and thus rapidly increase a security level of distributed heterogeneous computer systems. The proposed autonomous Honeypot can be used in the educational process in computer security laboratories for demonstrating security, simulations of different types of attacks, as well as in monitoring, respectively in observation of behaviour of computer system during the attacks.","","978-1-4799-2161-4","","10.1109/ICETA.2013.6674409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6674409","","","Internet;computer aided instruction;computer science education;firewalls","IDS;IT;Internet;antivirus software;autonomous hybrid Honeypot technology;computer security laboratories;computer system security;decoy based security technology;distributed heterogeneous computer systems;education process;exerted defence system;firewall;information technology;intrusion detection system;programme weak points;security panacea;virtual Honeypots","","1","","14","","","24-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In cognitive radio networks, effect of these malicious users on network performance becomes more threatening, where they impersonate primary users by emitting similar signals, causing secondary users to vacate the occupied channel needlessly. As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated.

Therefore, we propose Linux kernel-based novel feature in order to detect malware in higher than android version 4.0. In addition, we perform feature selection to select optimal feature about foregoing feature. This way is able to improve performance of malware detection system.

The proposed mechanism is based on identifying outlier measurements inside each cell, as well as corroboration among neighboring cells in a hierarchical structure to identify cells with significant number of malicious nodes. We provide a framework for taking into consideration inherent uncertainties, such as loss due to distance and shadowing, to reduce the likelihood of inaccurate classification of legitimate measurements as outliers. We use simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against attackers with varying degrees of sophistication. The results show that depending on the attacker-type and location parameters, in the worst case we can nullify the effect of up to 41% of attacker nodes in a particular region.

As a result, intrusion detection is an important component in network security. However, many current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are rule-based systems, which have limitations to detect novel intrusions. Moreover, encoding rules is time-consuming and highly depends on the knowledge of known intrusions. Therefore, we propose new systematic frameworks that apply a data mining algorithm called random forests in misuse, anomaly, and hybrid-network-based IDSs. In misuse detection, patterns of intrusions are built automatically by the random forests algorithm over training data. After that, intrusions are detected by matching network activities against the patterns. In anomaly detection, novel intrusions are detected by the outlier detection mechanism of the random forests algorithm. After building the patterns of network services by the random forests algorithm, outliers related to the patterns are determined by the outlier detection algorithm. The hybrid detection system improves the detection performance by combining the advantages of the misuse and anomaly detection. We evaluate our approaches over the knowledge discovery and data mining 1999 (KDDpsila99) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance provided by the proposed misuse approach is better than the best KDDpsila99 result; compared to other reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, our anomaly detection approach achieves higher detection rate when the false positive rate is low; and the presented hybrid system can improve the overall performance of the aforementioned IDSs.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2008.923876","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4603103","Computer network security;data mining;intrusion detection;random forests","Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Encoding;Information security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Training data","computer networks;data mining;knowledge based systems;security of data","IDSs;NIDSs;anomaly detection;computer network security;data mining algorithm;intrusion detection systems;knowledge discovery;misuse detection;network activities;network intrusion detection systems;outlier detection mechanism;random forests algorithm;rule-based systems;security breaches","","14","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on our observation, malicious web pages have uncommon behavior in order to evade from detection of Antivirus software. The anomaly behavior such as code encoding makes malicious web pages different from normal benign web pages. Current researches have noticed pattern-matching approach is not suitable to detect malicious web pages anymore, and then proposes a new detection method.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919","Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.","Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement","Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration","","3","","32","","2010-11-09","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because these parameters cannot be easily combined using a mathematical formula, fuzzy logic can be used to combine them; fuzzy logic can also reduce the number of false alarms. This paper presents a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, to detect port scanning attacks. A fuzzy logic controller is designed and integrated with Snort in order to enhance the functionality of port scanning detection. Experiments are carried out in both wired and wireless networks.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). It is common knowledge in the research community that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. In this paper we discuss this accuracy problem and decompose it into a detection problem and a confirmation problem. We then map the evaluation of this accuracy problem to the traditional software verification and validation problem, which allows us to analyze the techniques academics have been using to evaluate their IDS technologies. As a result, we are able to identify areas where research is needed to improve the assessment of the IDS accuracy problem through verification and validation techniques.","1071-9458","978-1-4673-4638-2","","10.1109/ISSRE.2012.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405405","Intrusion detection system;Network;Signature;Verification and Validation","Accuracy;Computers;Engines;Malware;Software;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer network security;digital signatures;formal verification;telecommunication traffic","IDS;antivirus systems;attack descriptions;computer network protection;firewalls;malicious behaviour;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic monitoring;signature based network;signature validation;signature verification","","0","","43","","","27-30 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications. Our work is focused on exploring the resistance of various machine learning algorithms to such an approach. In this paper we present an experimental framework designed to measure the susceptibility of anomaly detection algorithms to model drift. We also exhibit our preliminary results using various machine learning algorithms commonly found in intrusion detection research.","","978-1-4673-7556-6","","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208643","adversarial machine learning;cyber security;intrusion detection systems;model drift","Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Image color analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Security;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;security of data","anomaly detection algorithms;autonomous systems;data distribution;data driven approach;intrusion detection research;machine learning algorithms;machine learning techniques;model drift evaluation;on-line learning;periodic retraining;programming logic","","0","","19","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Matching works top-down, starting at the root of the tree and stopping at the first node whose DFA does not match. In the common case (benign traffic) matching does not reach the leaves. DFA-trees are built using Compact Overapproximate DFAs (CODFAs). A CODFA D' for D over-approximates the language accepted by D, has a smaller number of states than D, and has a low false-match rate.

First, packets are captured from the network, RST is used to pre-process the data and reduce the dimensions. The features selected by RST will be sent to SVM model to learn and test respectively. The method is effective to decrease the space density of data. The experiments compare the results with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and show RST and SVM schema could reduce the false positive rate and increase the accuracy.","","978-1-4577-1965-3","","10.1109/SCET.2012.6341943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341943","","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Principal component analysis;Rough sets;Support vector machines","Web services;authorisation;computer crime;data communication;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;rough set theory;support vector machines","IDS;PCA;RST;SVM schema;Web services;attack behavior;data communication environment;false positive rate;hackers;intruders;intrusion detection systems;machine learning methods;network intrusion detection;network security;normal behaviour;principal component analysis;rough set theory;secured system evolution;space density;support vector machine;system security;unauthorized intrusion","","0","","11","","","27-30 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response. In this article we present a survey on the work that has been done in the area of intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.","1536-1284","","","10.1109/MWC.2004.1269717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269717","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;mobile radio;network topology;telecommunication security","automatic retaliation;hacking;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;network security;network topology;security mechanisms;wireless ad hoc networks","","111","4","13","","","Feb 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Understanding how and why spoofing attacks are used, combined with a few simple prevention methods, can help protect your network from these malicious cloaking and cracking techniques.. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used to secure these environments for sharing their data over network and host based IDS approaches. The rapid improvements of intrusions in internet and other networks are the main factors responsible for the propagation of different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing environment. Now a days the Ids makes use of the signature based detection approach which detects the actions based on analyzing the patterns such as text, password, time etc. So this will create difficulties in updating information and detecting unknown attacks. In this paper we make use of an improved EADS (Exception Agent Detection System) for making the header information secure. Packet filtering is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. In this paper, we also propose an inter-domain packet_filter (IDPF) architecture that can mitigate the level of IP spoofing on the Interne together with the IDS. We establish the conditions under which the IDPF framework works correctly in that it does not discard packets with valid source addresses. In this paper we propose an improved behavioral method for combating the unknown threats other tha- the usual context and content scanning techniques.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738791","Exception agent system;IP spoofing;Intrusion detection system;Local area network;packet filter","Computer architecture;Computer science;Educational institutions;Filtering;IP networks;Intrusion detection","IP networks;Internet;digital signatures;security of data","IP spoofing attack;Internet;TCP/IP network;content scanning techniques;cracking techniques;exception agent detection system;interdomain packet filter architecture;intrusion detection system;malicious cloaking;packet filtering;signature based detection","","1","","12","","","27-29 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The natural traffic granularity is the flow between packet and circuit and between connection-less and connection-oriented modes. Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of “knowledge plane” and “network mining.”","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.20371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781206","","","","","","0","4","","","","Summer 2009","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

In this paper, we introduce a HMM-based method for anomaly detection. The proposed method is composed of two important stages: off-line training stage and on-line testing stage. In the off-line training stage, we train the normal behaviors by hidden Markov models (HMMs). In the on-line testing stage, we make the final decision based on the minimum risk Bayesian decision theory. We deploy the method on an IDS system to evaluate its performance, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve satisfying results.","","978-1-61284-158-8","","10.1109/ICBNMT.2011.6155940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6155940","Hidden Markov Model;Intrusion detection;Network security;anomaly detection","Accuracy;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training;Training data;Vectors","Bayes methods;decision theory;hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM-based method;IDS system;anomaly detection;computer system security;hidden Markov models;intrusion-detection system;minimum risk Bayesian decision theory;off-line training stage;on-line testing stage","","0","","7","","","28-30 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system proposed is self-adaptive and allows detection of online malicious attacks in the case of continuously updated web-applications.
