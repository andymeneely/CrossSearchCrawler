Examples include buffer overflow attacks, flooding attacks, system break-ins, etc. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a key role in detecting such malicious activities and enable administrators in securing network systems. Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses. Various design choices that were made to make this system practical and difficulties faced in integrating with existing models are also described. We show that this system achieves good performance empirically.","","978-1-4673-0296-8","978-1-4673-0297-5","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151345","","Computational modeling;Data models;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Servers;Testing;Training","computer network security;hidden Markov models;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","HMM based traffic model;adaptive network intrusion detection system;buffer overflow attacks;flooding attacks;hybrid approach;malicious activities;network system security;potential attack IP addresses;probabilistic classifier;system break-ins;unauthorized access","","2","","13","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","1-4244-0357-X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932","","Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;invasive software","Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system","","0","","11","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Preventing unauthorized accesses to critical digital assets, namely, data stored in the file management system, is one of the major objectives of user authentication. We therefore propose a non-intrusive approach capable of verifying a user having performed a few times of file-related operations via a mouse. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the mouse movement of the file-related operations in Explorer, which is the most common way to search, open, save, copy, and/or delete files in Windows environments, is used for authentication. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible and has three advantages: 1) it is non-intrusive, 2) it authenticates users in a short period of time, and 3) the quantity of mouse dynamics used for authentication purpose is lightweight.","","978-1-4673-0917-2","","10.1109/ISBAST.2012.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189655","Mouse dynamics;behavioral biometrics;user authentication","Accuracy;Authentication;Biometrics;Mice;Support vector machine classification;Vectors","file organisation;message authentication","Windows environment;data protection;digital asset;file management system;mouse dynamics-related scheme;nonintrusive authentication approach;unauthorized access prevention;user authentication system","","1","","28","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the propagation speed of worms, reactive defenses need to be automatic. It is important to understand where and how these defenses need to fit in the network so that they cannot be easily evaded. As there are several mechanisms malcode authors can use to bypass existing perimeter-centric defenses, this position paper argues that substantial defenses need to be embedded in the local area network, thus creating ""hard-LANs"" designed to detect and respond to worm infections. When compared with conventional network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), we believe that hard-LAN devices need to have two orders of magnitude better cost/performance, and at least two orders of magnitude better accuracy, resulting in substantial design challenges.","","0-7803-8686-8","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375206","","Communication system control;Computer aided software engineering;Computer worms;Costs;Humans;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Payloads;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;local area networks;telecommunication security","automatic reactive defenses;hard-LAN;local area network;malcode authors;network IDS;network intrusion detection systems;network worms;perimeter-centric defenses;propagation speed;self-propagating network programs","","6","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are becoming ubiquitous and have been widely used to transfer critical information, such as banking accounts, credit cards, e-mails, and social network credentials. The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Method ontology for intelligent network forensics analysis","Saad, S.; Traore, I.","","Privacy Security and Trust (PST), 2010 Eighth Annual International Conference on","20100930","2010","","","7","14","Network forensics is an after the fact process to investigate malicious activities conducted over computer networks by gathering useful intelligence. Recently, several machine learning techniques have been proposed to automate and develop intelligent network forensics systems. An intelligent network forensics system that reconstructs intrusion scenarios and makes attack attributions requires knowledge about intrusions signatures, evidences, impacts, and objectives. In addition, problem solving knowledge that describes how the system can use domain knowledge to analyze malicious activities is essential for the design of intelligent network forensics systems. In this paper we adapt recent researches in semantic-web, information architecture, and ontology engineering to design a method ontology for network forensics analysis.

The first is the traditionally recognized problem of monitoring the systems for faults and failures, recognizing and analyzing data, and responding with real understanding to the problems of the system. Increasingly complex systems create the opportunity for single points of failure to cascade when inaccurate assessment of system health increases response time or leads to faulty analysis of the problems involved. A second problem involves vulnerability to cyber intrusion, in which malignant actors can mask system degradation or present false data about system status. A resilient system will protect stability, efficiency, and security. To ensure these three states, the system must react to changing conditions within the system with coordination: no one component of the system can be allowed to react to problems without real consideration of the effects of that action on other components within the system. Systems with multi-agent design typically have three layers of action, a management layer, a coordination layer, and an execution layer. A resilient multi-agent system will emphasize functions of the execution layer, which has the responsibility of initiating actions, monitoring, analyzing, and controlling its own processes, while feeding information back to the higher levels of management and coordination. The design concept of a resilient control system execution agent (ReCoSEA) grows out of these underpinnings, and through the use of computational intelligence techniques, this paper suggests an associated design methodology.","","978-1-4673-0161-9","978-1-4673-0162-6","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309308","agent;control;resilient system","Computer security;Control systems;Fault detection;Process control;Sensor phenomena and characterization","multi-agent systems","ReCoSEA;complex systems;coordination layer;cyber intrusion;data analysis;execution layer;faulty analysis;malignant actors;management layer;multiagent design;resilient control system execution agent","","5","","26","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evaluation of the Stellar system deployed on a large, operational enterprise network demonstrated its ability to scale to high alert volumes while accurately forming and prioritizing scenarios. Stellar not only produced high priority scenarios matching all incidents reported by human analysts, but also discovered additional scenarios of concern that had initially gone unnoticed.

A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 μW output power to the IOT smart nodes. Measured results showed that the PV harvesting system achieved both ultra-low power operation capability at 12 μW and a peak self-sustaining efficiency of 86%.","0018-9200","","","10.1109/JSSC.2015.2418712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091040","Capacitor value modulation;Internet of things;MPPT;energy harvesting;photovoltaic;power management","Capacitors;Charge pumps;Energy harvesting;Hysteresis;Sensors;Switches;Time-domain analysis","Internet of Things;energy harvesting;hysteresis;maximum power point trackers;power consumption;power engineering computing;radio transmitters;solar cells;time-domain analysis","CVM scheme;IOT Smart Nodes;Internet Of Things network;PV cell;capacitor value modulation scheme;circuit level technique;hill-climbing MPPT mechanism;hysteresis controller;hysteresis regulation;power budget;power consumption;power hungry analog circuit;self-sustaining PV energy harvesting system;self-sustaining photovoltaic energy harvesting system;self-triggered one-shot mechanism;signal processor;time-domain MPPT;ultra-low power operation;wireless transmitter","","0","","29","","2015-04-21","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Indeed, the immense increase of the number of users of Facebook made it rise to become the largest existing social network with more than 1.2 billion active users. However, these numbers also rose the attention of hackers and attackers who aim at propagating malware and viruses for obtaining confidential information regarding social network users. In this manner, it is crucial that each Facebook user is able to easily access, control and analyse the information shared on the corresponding profile so that profile usage deviations can be more efficiently detected. However, despite the fact that Facebook allows an analysis of all user actions through the Timeline Review, this information is not comprehensively organized and there is no statistical analysis of the user generated data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework comprising a Facebook event collector, which by being provided with an authentication token for a user profile obtained through a Facebook application developed for this purpose, collects all the corresponding posted information and stores it in a relational database for a posteriori analysis. Through the graphical interface of the developed application, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user's behaviour. By storing each event with the corresponding timestamp, we are able to perform an efficient and comprehensive analysis of all posted contents and compute statistical models over the obtained data. In this manner, we can create a notion of normal usage profile and detect possible deviations which may be indicative of a compromised user account.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912474","Monitoring Framework;Profile Hijack;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Analytical models;Authentication;Computational modeling;Databases;Facebook;Monitoring","computer viruses;graphical user interfaces;information dissemination;relational databases;social networking (online);statistical analysis","Facebook event collector framework;Timeline Review;authentication token;content dissemination;graphical interface;information dissemination;malware;normal usage profile;posted content analysis;profile monitoring purposes;profile usage deviations;relational database;social networks;statistical models;viruses","","0","","15","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population.

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493","Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation","","digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures","NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering","","7","","36","","2010-06-17","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a novel classification system employing Deep Inspection technique, aiming to achieve Parallel Protocol Parsing (PPP). We start with an analytical study of the existing popular DI methods, namely, regular expression based methods and protocol parsing based methods.

Because Skype uses both encryption and overlays, detection and blocking of Skype is non- trivial. Motivated by the work ofBiondi and Desclaux [3], we adopt the view of Skype as a backdoor and we take a forensic approach to analyze it. We share our experience in this paper. With the forensic evidence, we identify a transport layer communication framework for Skype. We further formulate a set of socket-based detection and control policies for Skype traffics. Our detection method is a hybrid between payload and non-payload inspections, with improved accuracy and version sustainability over the traditional payload-only approaches. Our solution is practicable both inside and outside the NAT firewalls.

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We observe that contemporary, widely-used GPUs, both NVIDIA's and AMD's, do not initialize newly allocated GPU memory pages which may contain sensitive user data. By exploiting such vulnerabilities, we propose attack methods for revealing a victim program's data kept in GPU memory both during its execution and right after its termination. We further show the high applicability of the proposed attacks by applying them to the Chromium and Firefox web browsers which use GPUs for accelerating webpage rendering. We detect that both browsers leave rendered webpage textures in GPU memory, so that we can infer which web pages a victim user has visited by analyzing the remaining textures.

Especially in the mobile area there are many security issues that have not yet been satisfactorily addressed, let alone been solved. Most of the security mechanisms and techniques used in wired networks tend to rely upon a fixed network topology. For example, firewalls and intrusion detection systems are placed at central points of a network and configured with a model of the network's structure to control and analyse the data flows transferred for harmful content. If at all, adopting these measures for the mobile world is not easy due to its dynamically changing environments and the mobile device's resource constraints that do not allow demanding analyse tasks. In this paper, we present our work in progress of developing a system architecture for cooperative and self-protecting mobile devices. Our approach is based on the assumption that a mobile network can be protected by securing all participating devices or at least all honest participating devices. Thus, we no longer insist on a global view of the network but on several local views. To make these views as precise as possible and to avoid serious performance bottlenecks on a single device we propose a strategy for coupling trusted mobile devices together into a cooperating group","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198802","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Network topology;Protection;Virtual private networks","mobile computing;mobile handsets;security of data;telecommunication network topology","cooperative self-protecting mobile devices;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;mobile network;network topology;security issues;trustful relationships","","0","","39","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","978-0-7695-4159-4","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","3","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially while facing high noise environments or the situation of updating profiles not in time, intrusion detection systems will have high false alarm rate. In this paper, a new anomaly detection algorithm based on hierarchical clustering, called ADBHC, is proposed. ADBHC generates clusters using density-based partitioning method which has less computational cost. It uses the improved hierarchical clustering tree to implement fast scalable and adaptive anomaly detection. The improved hierarchical clustering tree supports updating profiles at any time.

Stealthy superpoint is a host that its cardinality is between two thresholds during a measurement period. Detecting stealthy superpoints helps intrusion systems identify potential attackers. However, stealthy superpoints may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate, and they can easily evade the detection. The existing algorithm can not directly be used to detect them. This paper proposes an algorithm based on Bitmap which can detect stealthy superpoints. The algorithm includes online module and offline module. The online module consists of two submodules. One uses a bloom filter to filter the duplicate packets and store the source addresses. The other uses two-dimensional bit arrays to process packets. The offline estimates the cardinality. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our algorithm can precisely detect stealthy superpoints and estimate their cardinalities.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945711","Bitmap;Stealthy superpoints;host cardinality","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Estimation;Indexes;Internet","Internet;computer crime;computer network security;peer-to-peer computing","Bloom filter;Internet host;attackers identification;bitmap-based algorithm;duplicate packets;host cardinality;intrusion systems;offline module;online module;peers;process packets;source addresses;stealthy superpoint detection;two-dimensional bit arrays","","0","","14","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods. Only using several attributes also improves the efficiency in terms of attributes constructing, models training as well as intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-3309-4","","10.1109/CRISIS.2008.4757464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4757464","Bayesian networks;C4.5;DDoS attack detection;Intrusion detection system;attribute selection","Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","belief networks;security of data","Bayesian networks;DDoS attacks;attribute selection;;distributed denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection system","","3","","16","","","28-30 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new IDS alert correlation method to detect attack scenarios in real-time. The proposed method is based on causal approach due to the strength of causal methods in practice. Most of causal methods can be deployed offline but not in real-time due to time and memory limitations. In the proposed method the knowledge base of attack patterns is represented in a graph model called Causal Relations Graph. In offline, we construct some trees related to alerts probable correlations. In real-time for each received alert, we can find its correlations with previously received alerts by performing a search only in the corresponding tree. Thus processing time of each alert decreases significantly. In addition, the proposed method is immune to the deliberately slowed attacks. To verify the proposed method, it was implemented in C++ and we used DARPA2000 dataset to test it. Experimental results show the correctness of the proposed alert correlation and its efficiency with respect to the run time.","","978-1-4673-2387-1","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408197","Alert;Alert Correlation;Attack;Attack Scenario;Graph;Intrusion;Intrusion Detection System","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Memory management;Real-time systems;Security","C++ language;computer network security;knowledge based systems;real-time systems;trees (mathematics)","C++ implementation;DARPA 2000 dataset;IDS alert correlation method;attack patterns;causal approach;causal methods;causal relations graph;graph model;intrusion detection alert correlation;intrusion detection systems;knowledge base representation;real-time attack scenario detection;trees","","1","","20","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Internet worms have become one type of major threats to the network infrastructure. Distributed defense collaborating with single-point-deployed security applications over multiple network domains are promising. However, most of the reported collaborative schemes for distributed defense are application-specific. There is not much research that studies the general properties of variant collaborative schemes systematically. In this paper explores properties of general collaborative defense strategies from the perspective of complex system. A three-layered network modeling platform has been developed. Taking advantage of small-world network model, the platform consists of two network layers and one application layer. On top of it, an experimental comparison study of collaborative defense schemes has been conducted. Their performance and effectiveness facing signature-embedded worm attacks have been evaluated.","","978-963-9995-24-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5766992","Collaborative Distributed Defense;Internet Worms;Small world model","Analytical models;Collaboration;Government;Grippers;Internet;Monitoring;Variable speed drives","Internet;groupware;invasive software","Internet worms;collaborative strategies;comparison study;distributed defense;malicious attackers;network infrastructure;network layers;small-world modeling;three layered network modeling","","0","","36","","","9-12 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, it is in order to reduce and eliminate the security delay brought by the traditional passive protection. Secondly, it is for resolving the problems of zero-day break produced by Trojan. Finally, it is with the purpose of meeting the high-level security requirements when the key information systems are under the specific safety situations. At the end of this paper, a structural security application model which is combined with the technologies of active controllable defense such as active prediction, dynamic detection and instant response is designed to prevent various known and unknown attacks effectively for building the hierarchical, three-dimensional and integrated defense architecture of the network information security.","","978-1-4244-5850-9","","10.1109/WCINS.2010.5541867","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541867","Active Controllable Defense;BPDR Model;Behavior Defense;Security Model","Databases;Delay;Helium;Information security;Information systems;Information technology;Power engineering and energy;Power system protection;Predictive models;Safety","","","","0","","11","","","25-27 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Having conducted a statistical analysis on this data set, we found two important issues which highly affects the performance of evaluated systems, and results in a very poor evaluation of anomaly detection approaches. To solve these issues, we have proposed a new data set, NSL-KDD, which consists of selected records of the complete KDD data set and does not suffer from any of mentioned shortcomings.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356528","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356528","","Application software;Computational intelligence;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Statistical analysis;Testing","security of data;statistical analysis","KDD CUP 99 data set analysis;anomaly detection;attack detection;signature-based intrusion detection system;statistical analysis","","93","","23","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fact that the uncertain short sequences of system calls affect detection models in various modeling methods has not been taken into account. The detection capability of anomaly detection models against known and unknown attacks is greatly affected. It is pointed out that the uncertain short sequences of system calls are closely related to contexts. The behavior status of the sequences of system calls is depicted by the abnormal membership on fuzzy segments. Experiment results indicate that the modeling method based on the abnormal membership on fuzzy segments increases the detection capability against known and unknown attacks.","","0-7803-8963-8","","10.1109/ISADS.2005.1452140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1452140","","Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Event detection;Fuzzy systems;Immune system;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Object detection","Internet;fuzzy set theory;security of data","Web system security;anomaly detection;fuzzy segments;privileged program","","3","","9","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These malicious attempts including hacking, botnets and works are pushing organization networks to a risky atmosphere where the intruder tries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of resources. In order to detect these malicious activities, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been widely deployed in corporate networks. IDSs play an important role in monitoring traffic behaviors in a computer network, identifying the anomalous activity and notifying the security analyst with current network status. Unfortunately, one of the IDSs' drawbacks is they produce a large number of false positives and non-relevant positives alerts that could overwhelm the security analyst. Therefore, the process of analyzing alerts in order to provide a more synthetic and high-level view of the attempted intrusions is needed. This process is called Alert Correlation. In this paper, we present commonly used alert correlation approaches and highlight their advantages and disadvantages from various perspectives. Subsequently, we summarize some current alert correlation models with their alert correlation approach.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836553","Alert Correlatios;Anomaly Detection;Intrusion Detection System;Misuse Detection","Computational modeling;Computers;Correlation;Data mining;Internet;Intrusion detection","security of data","IDS;alert correlation models;intrusion detection systems;malicious attempts;network intrusion attempts","","0","","35","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It helps to make work environment essential and reliable. Access control security technology mainly includes firewall technology, intrusion detection technology, and security auditing technology. These technologies still have some problems and shortages though they are matured in some degree. The expert system for preventing and auditing intrusion is a series of software and hardware systems for reducing the risk of computer network security. It is an effective closed loop control system that integrates with firewall, intrusion detection, and auditing trail analysis. It uses the learning ability of expert system to add knowledge and rules.

We propose a graph similarity-based approach to event detection and identification that integrates a number of techniques to collect time-varying situation information, extract correlations between event attributes, and characterize and identify security events. Diverging from the traditional rule- or statistical-based pattern matching techniques, the proposed mechanism represents security events in a graphical form of correlation networks and identifies security events through the computation of graph similarity measurements to eliminate the need for constructing user or system profiles. These technical components take fundamentally different approaches from traditional empirical or statistical methods and are designed based on rigorous computational analysis with mathematically proven performance guarantee. The performance superiority of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by extensive simulation and experimental results.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683648","","Computer security;Computers;Correlation;Data mining;Event detection;Monitoring","graph theory;knowledge based systems;pattern matching;security of data;statistical analysis","computational analysis;correlation networks;correlation techniques;cyber situation awareness;development community;event attributes;graph similarity measurements;graph similarity-based approach;network research;performance superiority;rule-based pattern matching techniques;security event analysis;security events detection;security events identification;statistical methods;statistical-based pattern matching techniques;time-varying situation information","","0","","22","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
