Unfortunately some anomaly detection system (ADS) over machine learning may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal or abnormal data. In this paper, to solve this problem, we introduce a new approach for anomaly detection using contiguous expert voting algorithm (CEVS). At first, we present our framework of the anomaly detection system, and then we define a new algorithm based on data mining, at last we will use this algorithm to detect the internet anomaly and report our experimental result. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the detection performance of the ADS, where traditional anomaly detection system is used.","","978-1-4244-5204-0","978-1-4244-5206-4","10.1109/ICACIA.2009.5361127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361127","Anomaly detection;Computer security;Contiguous expert voting algorithm;Data mining","Association rules;Computer security;Costs;Data mining;Face detection;Internet;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Voting","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection system;contiguous expert voting algorithm;data mining;machine learning;malicious intrusion","","1","","12","","","23-25 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, the approach taken to find attacks is to inspect the contents of every packet. However, packet inspection cannot easily be performed at high-speeds. Therefore, researchers and operators started investigating alternative approaches, such as flow-based intrusion detection. In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed. The concept of flows is explained, and relevant standards are identified. The paper provides a classification of attacks and defense techniques and shows how flow-based techniques can be used to detect scans, worms, Botnets and (DoS) attacks.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2010.032210.00054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5455789","Botnets;DoS;Network flows;attacks;intrusion detection;scan;worms","","IP networks;computer network security;data flow analysis;invasive software","Botnets;DoS attacks;IP flow based intrusion detection;data flow;packet inspection;worms","","47","","82","","2010-04-26","Third Quarter 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, the amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Several feature selection and feature extraction techniques have been proposed to reduce the size of data. Few are focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the finding of that finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. A new hybrid algorithm MID-PCA combining PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance - MID evaluation criteria) is proposed. PCA is first applied to the original dataset. Then, mRMR-MID is applied to the intermediary output to further reduce redundancy and maximize relevancy. An exhaustive evaluation of the MID-PCA algorithm is conducted with the KDD Cup'99, a used widely dataset in the network security community. MID-PCA performance was compared to that of PCA and mRMR using two classifiers namely J48 (C4.5) and BayesNet. Experimental results assert the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm MID-PCA for NIDS feature extraction compared with PCA and Mutual Information. The newly proposed MID-PCA shows better performance and classification accuracies with reduced datasets of only 4 dimensions for BayesNet (99.77%) and 6 dimensions for J48 (99.94%). This is an improvement over PCA which achieves similar classification accuracy with 12 principal components (twelve dimensions). An extension of this paper will conduct broader experiments using other datasets, then compare results to that of several well known feature reduction algorithms to confirm the superiority of MID-PCA.","","978-1-4673-2276-8","","10.1109/IS.2012.6335176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335176","Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Mutual Information;Principal Component Analysis","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Principal component analysis","Internet;computer network security;data analysis;feature extraction;pattern classification;principal component analysis;redundancy;telecommunication traffic","BayesNet classifier comparison;Internet traffic monitoring;J48 classifier comparison;KDD Cup'99;MID evaluation criteria;MID-PCA hybrid algorithm;NIDS;classification accuracy;data size reduction;feature extraction technique;feature selection technique;mRMR;malicious activity detection;minimum redundancy maximum relevance;mutual information;network intrusion detection system;principal component analysis;redundancy reduction;relevancy maximization","","0","","31","","","6-8 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we consider this question in the context of multi-step attacks. We derive simulated distributions of the posterior probability of exploit given the observation of a series of alerts and bounds on the posterior uncertainty given a particular distribution of the model parameters. Knowledge of such bounds introduces the novel prospect of a confidence versus agility tradeoff in IDS administration. Such a tradeoff could give administrators flexibility in IDS configuration, allowing them to choose detection confidence at the price of detection latency, according to organizational priorities.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721564","Bayesian network;Intrusion detection;Probabilistic inference","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer security;Expert systems;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Phase detection;System testing;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;parameter estimation;probability;security of data","inference uncertainty;intrusion detection system;low base rate address;parameter estimation error;posterior probability distribution;test condition;uncertainty-bounding multistep analysis","","0","1","11","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides simplifying our daily lives, the MTC business represents a promising market for mobile operators to increase their revenues. However, before a complete deployment of MTC over mobile networks, there is need to update the specifications of mobile networks in order to cope with the expected high number (massive deployment) of MTC devices. Indeed, large scale deployment of MTC devices represents an important challenge as a high number of MTC devices, simultaneously connecting to the mobile network, may cause congestion and system overload, which can degrade the network performance and even result in network node failures. Several activities have been led by 3GPP to alleviate system overload introduced by MTC. Most of the devised approaches represent only incremental solutions. Unlike these solutions, we devise a complete new architectural vision to support MTC in mobile networks. This vision relies on the marriage of mobile networks and cloud computing, specifically exploiting recent advances in network function virtualization (NFV). The aim of the proposed vision, namely LightEPC, is: 1) to orchestrate the on-demand creation of cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks dedicated for MTC and 2) to simplify the network attach procedure for MTC devices by creating only one NFV MTC function that groups all the usual procedures. By doing so, LightEPC is able to create and scale instances of NFV MTC functions on demand and in an elastic manner to cope with any sudden increase in traffic generated by MTC devices. To evaluate LightEPC, some preliminary analysis were conducted and the obtained analytical results indicate the ability of LightEPC in alleviating congestion and scaling up fast with massive numbers of MTC devices in mobile networks. Finally, a real-life implementation of LightEPC on top of cloud platform is discussed.","2169-3536","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2359649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906244","Carrier cloud;Machine type communications (MTC);mobile cloud networking;network function virtualization (NFV)","Logic gates;Machine-to-machine communications;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Object recognition;Protocols;Radio access networks;Servers","3G mobile communication;cloud computing;mobile computing;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","3GPP;LightEPC framework;MTC;NFV;cloud computing;cloud-based lightweight mobile core networks;machine type communications;network function virtualization;network node failures","","3","","27","","2014-09-22","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a simple and robust method for intrusion detection in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA) where each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is then employed to reduce the high dimensional data vectors and thus, detection is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. Our experiments with the KDD Cup 99 dataset, although not yet completed, have shown that this approach is promising in terms of detection accuracy. It is also effective to identify most known attacks as well as new attacks.

In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011","0-7695-2574-1","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","21","2","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender.

However, it is still a big problem on how to draw an exact decision boundary between relevant and irrelevant objects in binary classification due to much uncertainty produced in the process of the traditional algorithms. The proposed model CTTC (Centroid Training for Text Classification) aims to build an uncertainty boundary to absorb as many indeterminate objects as possible so as to elevate the certainty of the relevant and irrelevant groups through the centroid clustering and training process. The clustering starts from the two training subsets labelled as relevant or irrelevant respectively to create two principal centroid vectors by which all the training samples are further separated into three groups: POS, NEG and BND, with all the indeterminate objects absorbed into the uncertain decision boundary BND. Two pairs of centroid vectors are proposed to be trained and optimized through the subsequent iterative multi-learning process, all of which are proposed to collaboratively help predict the polarities of the incoming objects thereafter. For the assessment of the proposed model, F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy have been chosen as the key evaluation measures. We stress the F<sub>1</sub> measure because it can display the overall performance improvement of the final classifier better than Accuracy. A large number of experiments have been completed using the proposed model on the Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) which is important standard dataset in the field. The experiment results show that the proposed model has significantly improved the binary text classification performance in both F<sub>1</sub> and Accuracy compared with three other influential baseline models.","","","","10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058104","Centroid optimization;Centroid vector;Multi-learning;Text classification;clustering","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Optimization;Testing;Training;Uncertainty;Vectors","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","RCV1;Reuters Corpus Volume 1;binary classification;binary text classification performance;centroid clustering;centroid training;data mining;influential baseline models;iterative multilearning process;machine learning;model CTTC;principal centroid vectors;standard dataset;text classification technology;training process;uncertain decision boundary BND;uncertainty boundary","","0","","20","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such architecture leverages the principle of separation of concerns, and hence proposes to build up a system comprising entities specialized in performing different tasks, appropriately orchestrated by a broker entity playing the crucial role of the mediator. This paper stresses the point that a distributed system, besides being inherently more scalable than a centralized one, allows for better detection capabilities thanks to the effective exploitation of the inner heterogeneity of the involved detection engines.

However, WSNs have limited energy resources that hinder the dissemination of the raw data over the network to a central location. This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system. Our model is capable of tracking changes in the data distribution in the monitored environment. We illustrate the proposed algorithm with numerical results on both real-life and simulated data sets, which demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach compared to existing methods.","1550-4786","978-1-4577-2075-8","","10.1109/ICDM.2011.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137251","Anomaly Detection;IDCAD;Incremental Elliptical Boundary Estimation;Streaming Data Analysis","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Covariance matrix;Data models;Sensors;Training;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;security of data;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;batch training;data mining approaches;data modeling approaches;fixed offline training period;incremental elliptical boundary estimation;spatially dense data;wireless sensor networks","","7","","27","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An anomaly dete-ction method based on K-means clustering is introduced to detect and filter request flooding attacks and asymmetric attacks. To defend against session-flooding attacks, we propose an encouragement model that uses client's session rate as currency.

To differentiate between normal SQL queries and those sent by an attacker we divide SQL statements into tokens and pass them to our detection system, which predicts the next token, taking into account previously seen tokens. In the learning phase tokens are passed to recurrent neural network (RNN) trained by back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. Teaching data are shifted by one token forward in time with relation to input. The purpose of the testing phase is to predict the next token in the sequence.

This work follows the linguistic fuzzy modelling approach. It uses an extended Classifier System (XCS) as mechanism to extract linguistic fuzzy rules. XCS is one of the most successful accuracy-based learning classifier systems. It provides several mechanisms for rule generalization and also allows for online training if necessary. It can be used in sequential and non-sequential tasks. Although originally applied in discrete domains it has been extended to continuous and fuzzy environments. The proposed Linguistic Fuzzy XCS has been applied to several well-known classification problems and the results compared with both, precise and linguistic fuzzy models.","1098-7584","1-4244-1209-9","1-4244-1210-2","10.1109/FUZZY.2007.4295593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4295593","","Costs;Data mining;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Gas insulated transmission lines;Humans;Knowledge acquisition;Machine learning algorithms;Memory","approximation theory;fuzzy set theory;learning systems;linguistics;pattern classification","automatic rule extraction;data-driven construction;extended classifier system;fuzzy sets;interpretability;learning classifier systems;linguistic fuzzy-XCS classifier system;numerical approximation;rule generalization","","0","","21","","","23-26 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sharing of data for data mining can bring a lot of advantages for research and business collaboration. The misuse of these techniques may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. However, large repositories of data contain private data and sensitive rules that must be protected before published. Motivated by the multiple conflicting requirements of data sharing, privacy preserving and knowledge discovery, and privacy preserving data mining has become a research hotspot in data mining and database security fields. Researchers have recently made efforts at hiding sensitive association rules. This paper presents a novel based approach that strategically modifies a few transactions in the database. It modifies support or confidence values for hiding sensitive rules without producing many side effects. Nevertheless, undesired side effects such as nonsensitive rules falsely hidden and spurious rules falsely generated, may be produced in the rule hiding process.","","978-1-4673-0213-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215950","Association Rule;Association Rule mining;Data mining;Mining methods;Privacy Preservation;Rule hiding","Abstracts;Conferences;Data privacy;Databases;Medical diagnostic imaging","data analysis;data mining;data privacy;database management systems;transaction processing","association rule mining;business collaboration;data analysis;data privacy preserving;data repository;data sharing;database security fields;database transactions;knowledge discovery;nonsensitive rules;pattern based framework;privacy preservation;privacy preserving data mining;private data;rule hiding process;sensitive association rules;sensitive information","","0","","13","","","30-31 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011","0-7695-2339-0","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","7","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To evaluate and compare such techniques requires up to date datasets, useful truth data and the ability to record the outputs of the techniques in a common format. Existing datasets for network anomaly detection are either limited / aged or lacking in truth data. This paper presents a new annotation format allowing network datasets to be annotated with arbitrary event data. Use of the new format is demonstrated in a method to create new datasets that retain more information than a simple network capture. The supporting tools for the annotation format allow for incorporating events from multiple different sources. The ability to record and share network data and detected anomalies is a key component in moving anomaly detection research forward.","","978-1-4799-3782-0","","10.1109/LCNW.2014.6927720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927720","annotations;anomaly detection;passive data collection","Accuracy;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Reliability;Semantics;Software","data handling;security of data","data annotation;data sharing;network anomaly detection;network operations;network trace data;security monitoring","","0","","21","","","8-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this problem, a self-adaptive anomaly detection system was developed using fuzzy detection anomaly algorithm with negative selection of biology. The algorithm improves the accuracy of the detection method and produces a novel method to measure the deviation from the normal that does not need a discrete division of the non-self space. The proposed anomaly detection model is designed as flexible, extendible, and adaptable in order to meet the needs and preferences of network administrators and can be also supplied for IPv6 environment. Different experiments are performed with MIT-DARAP 1999 dataset (Lippmann et al., 2000) and real word data from different sources.

One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.","","978-1-4244-2676-8","978-1-4244-2677-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175","","Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework","","5","","14","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased. The model is verified on the dataset taken from KDD99Cup which is a standard dataset used for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8862-9","978-0-9564263-6-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678024","","","computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;R-to-L intrusion detection system;evolutionary techniques;feature extraction;incremental genetic algorithm;machine learning;network security;pattern classification;remote-to-local attack detection;standard dataset","","0","","18","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation X.805 suggests that availability has a specific meaning for security, namely, that it “ensures that there is no denial of authorized access to network elements, stored information, information flows, services and applications due to events impacting the network.” This definition is very similar to the definition of availability that reliability engineers use in describing functionality.

This is mainly due to increasing number of attacks as well as sophisticated nature of today's intrusions. Moreover, it has been shown that various critical components of a system can be targeted. This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion.

Protocols assume that no malicious intruder node is present, which impacts all the layers by some means, chiefly, the network layer. This paper is a brief review on such attacks whose focus is on degrading MANETs efficiency. It extends in apprising well identified intrusion detection and detection techniques for wide range of attacks.

SQL injection attacks (SQLIAs) are one of the most significant of such threats. Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","","978-1-4244-4678-0","978-0-7695-3760-3","10.1109/LADC.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325","Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks","Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes","security of data","Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach","","3","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since it is too expensive for many application systems to rebuild and embed such modules, the paper proposes an economical solution which can identify the database operation source close to the fact.

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536","intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering","Costs;Engines;Face detection;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Reconfigurable architectures;Scalability;Software performance;Throughput","computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security","DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture","","1","","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an opportunistic voting algorithm and present test results from a 48-node testbed in which colluding attackers generate corroborating false accusations against pairs of innocent nodes.

Being able to understand and predict trends in computer and network security incidents can aid an organization with resource allocation for prevention of such incidents, as well as evaluation of mitigation strategies. We look at using time series models with a large set of security incident data. We examine appropriateness of the data for modeling and consider needed transformations.

The reduction in video hardware cost has made it more feasible for large scale camera deployment. However, the increased scale of camera deployment creates difficulties for humans to track people through the monitored space and to recognize important events as they happen in timely manner without human intervention. In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times. In addition, we have managed to deploy 35 camera streams on single GPU card running at 20 frames per second which results in scalability factor of 1.75 times vs. a server class PC. Indeed, we have also managed to maintain the video analytics accuracy at 100% for given test dataset, in this implementation of the system.","","978-1-4799-2208-6","","10.1109/SPC.2013.6735111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735111","CUDA;GPGPU;parallelization;streaming;video analytics;video surveillance system","Accuracy;Cameras;Central Processing Unit;Conferences;Graphics processing units;Process control;Streaming media","graphics processing units;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;security of data;video cameras;video streaming;video surveillance","CUDA;GPGPU;camera surveillance area;compute unified device architecture;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion detection system;large scale camera deployment;macroparallelization;microparallelization;multinode video analytics processing;people tracking;real-time multinode streaming;surveillance activity;video hardware cost reduction;video surveillance system","","0","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing usages of WSN applications such as health care and disaster reporting, security requirements, wireless communication has become more critical. Researchers of intrusion detection system on WSN have suggested that systems' detecting mechanisms would likely affect their detections effective and lifetime of whole networks. Ontology can collect and organize the attributes of attacks However, those methods have empirically documented the link between ontology concept and light-weight Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is scant. Therefore, the aim of this paper attempts to explore how intrusion detection system about ontology and light-weight IDS are related. The manager constructs relationship of sensor nodes on ontology to detect Sybil attack. Combine light-weight IDS the ranger method to reduce energy consumption and the isolation tables avoid detecting anomaly repeatedly. We proposed a lightweight ontology-based IDS, which improves existence shortcomings of IDS on WSN effectively.","","978-1-4577-0817-6","978-0-7695-4449-6","10.1109/ICGEC.2011.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042715","Intrusion Detection System;Ontology;Sybil Attack;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Ontologies;Wireless sensor networks","ontologies (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Sybil attack detection;WSN application;disaster reporting;health care;light-weight intrusion detection system;lightweight ontology-based IDS;security requirement;sensor node;wireless communication;wireless sensor network","","4","","10","","","Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current common solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely heavily on prior explicit knowledge of specific instances of malcode binary code signatures. During the time between its appearance and an update being sent to anti-virus tools, a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We present a new host-based intrusion detection approach, based on analyzing the behavior of the computer to detect the presence of unknown malicious code. The new approach consists on classification algorithms that learn from previous known malcode samples which enable the detection of an unknown malcode. We performed several experiments to evaluate our approach, focusing on computer worms being activated on several computer configurations while running several programs in order to simulate background activity. We collected 323 features in order to measure the computer behavior. Four classification algorithms were applied on several feature subsets. The average detection accuracy that we achieved was above 90% and for specific unknown worms even above 99%.","","","1-4244-1329-X","10.1109/ISI.2007.379542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258682","Malicious code detection;worms","Binary codes;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Operating systems;Performance evaluation;Software packages","computer viruses;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","anti-virus tool;binary code signature;classification algorithm;computer worms;host-based intrusion detection;machine learning;unknown malicious code detection","","3","","29","","","23-24 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed SPS uses the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) in order to detect attacks and filter malicious frames. The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead. The soundness of the proposed method is proved through both theoretical analysis, as well as experiments.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687997","","Computer security;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Privacy;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;computer network security","HAN;ZigBee based home area networks;attack prevention;dynamic threshold;malicious frames;novel spoofing prevention system;received signal strength;security center;smart grids;spoofing detection module;static threshold","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mechanisms are developed to detect the origin of DDoS attacks. The main issue concerned with detection systems is IP spoofing. This paper proposes a packet marking scheme which marks router information into IP header field of the packet to overcome the issue of IP spoofing. The marked information is used to reconstruct the IP address of the ingress router connected to the attack source at the detecting end. The work is deployed in the programmable routers in real time and the attack source detection mechanisms are carried out. Attack sources are detected from the marked information in the IP header of the packet. As the detection scheme relies only on the marked information in the IP header fields, the source of the spoofed packets can also be accurately identified.","","978-1-4577-0588-5","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972268","DDoS attacks;attack source identification;packet marking;programmable routers","Computer crime;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Probabilistic logic;Real time systems;Workstations","computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDoS attack;IP header field;IP spoofing;attack source detection mechanism;attack source identification;distributed denial of service attack;marking algorithm;packet marking scheme;programmable router;router information;router level","","4","","7","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This stimulated our research to make use of the limited computational capabilities of these sensor nodes to build a normal model of the data gathered. Hence by having the normal model, anomalies can then be detected and forwarded to a central location. This process is done locally in the sensor nodes and hence reduces the power consumption used in transmitting all the data. Our algorithm is an enhanced version of the Data Capture Anomalies Detection Algorithm, which is used to compute a local model of the normal data in wireless sensor networks. In this paper the Data Capture Anomalies Detection is used to partition the data and then send all the data to a central server for data classification, building on the Data Capture Anomalies Detection method and in order to classify the partitioned data, our algorithm Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection sends anomalies (2%) as well as roughly (2% or 4%) of normal data for further data processing and classification purposes. Experimental results on synthetic data show that Two-Layered Data Capture Anomalies Detection is able to provide promising results.","2161-1343","978-1-4799-5263-2","","10.1109/DeSE.2013.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7041095","anomaly detection;distributed data mining;elliptical boundary estimation;two-layered ellipse approach;wireless sensor network","Artificial neural networks;Conferences;Covariance matrices;Data mining;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","outlier preprocessing;partitioned data classification;two-layered data capture anomaly detection algorithm;two-layered ellipse approach;wireless sensor networks","","0","","18","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
