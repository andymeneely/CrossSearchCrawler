These may serve various functions and will reflect each student's goals and understanding of the text. This research proposes two simple biology-inspired approaches to represent the patterns of student annotations and to cluster students based on the similarity between their annotations; the annotations produced were simple highlighting. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the research compared the processing speed of these approaches with generic hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in Matlab and compared the accuracy of the clusters with the clusters created by human raters. The results show that both of the proposed approaches are more efficient and accurate than the generic hierarchical clustering algorithm. The proposed methodology can be implemented as an add-on to existing learning management systems and e-book readers, to automatically offer the students important notes and annotations conducted by others (either peers or students in the past) who have similar annotation behaviour pattern and style to the students.","","978-1-4673-2173-0","","10.1109/T4E.2012.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305938","Annotation;Biology-inspired;Chromosome;Clustering;Patterns","Benchmark testing;Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Educational institutions;Humans;Standards","computer aided instruction;pattern clustering;text analysis","annotation behaviour pattern;biology-inspired approach;digital text annotation;e-book reader;learning management system;student annotation;student clustering","","0","","25","","","18-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the socket level traffic fingerprinting helps our frame work to achieve a finer granularity on rogue AP detection among the existing schemes. This framework has the following nice properties: i) it requires neither specialized hardware nor modification to existing standards; ii) the proposed mechanism greatly improves the rogue AP detection probability so that network resilience is improved; iii) it provides a cost-effective solution to Wi-Fi network security enhancement by incorporating free but mature software tools; iv) it can protect the network from adversaries capable of using customized equipment and/or violating the IEEE 802.11 standard; v) its open architecture allows extra features to be easily added on in the future.

We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively.

Proceedings from the Sixth Annual IEEE SMC","20050815","2005","","","340","347","This paper investigates anomaly detection techniques that have been successful for detecting external threats and applies them to the insider threat problem. The ""insider threat"" involves the actions of a trusted and privileged user who is inappropriately accessing or disseminating sensitive information or otherwise compromising information systems. In contrast, the ""external threat"" involves the actions of an outsider attempting to compromise or gain access to the information systems. Although approaches for automatically detecting external threat instances have been quite successful (i.e., intrusion detection systems), there is very little similar work for the insider threat. In the past, anomaly detection systems have proven useful for detecting external threat. Anomaly detection at the system call level offers a high degree of information assurance in terms of tamper-resistance and system activity coverage. Therefore, we investigate three system-call-based feature representations: n-grams of system call names, histograms of system call names, and individual system calls with associated parameters. We find that none of these representations consistently performs as well when dealing with the internal threat as previous results show for external threat detection. However, parameter-based features for certain system calls do show some sensitivity to detecting the insider threat, and we plan to explore and enhance this sensitivity in future work.","","0-7803-9290-6","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495972","","Business;Computer vision;Data security;Government;Histograms;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Operating systems;Testing","information systems;security of data","anomaly detection system;external threat detection;histograms;information access;information assurance;information dissemination;information systems;insider threat detection;intrusion detection system;outlier detection;sensitive information;system call feature representation;system call names;tamper resistance;trust;user privilege","","12","","18","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM). Our process trace clustering approach using HMMs for system call anomaly detection provides accurate results and reduces the complexity required to detect anomalies.

These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as “safe” or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks.

Without a comprehensive estimate of the building occupancy, the rescue personnel are subjected to great risk with little assurance that a given search area is populated. As cloud based computing becomes more ubiquitous, commercial building occupants are utilizing cloud based solutions for managing work schedules. Consequently, the opportunity exists to exploit these whole building occupant schedules to infer occupancy levels throughout the building. In addition, when combined with data from directional passive infrared sensors, and a knowledge of the number of mobile users on Wi-Fi access points, the occupancy profiles can be adjusted based on actively sensed occupancy. This paper discusses an Inferred Occupancy Characterization (IOC) Architecture, which aims to effectively determine occupancy levels within various zones of a multi-zone structure.","","978-1-4799-3963-3","","10.1109/THS.2013.6699097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6699097","Cloud computing;disaster response;occupancy;rescue operations","Buildings;Estimation;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile handsets;Schedules;Sensor phenomena and characterization","building management systems;cloud computing;emergency management;scheduling","IOC architecture;Wi-Fi access points;Wireless Fidelity;attack-and-disaster response;building occupancy levels;building occupant schedules;cloud based computing;cloud based passive building occupancy characterization;cloud based solutions;commercial building occupants;directional passive infrared sensors;inferred occupancy characterization;natural disasters;occupancy profiles;rescue personnel;terrorist attacks;work schedules management","","1","","10","","","12-14 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. In this paper we are proposing a techniques, which maintain the small distributed signature database and dynamically update it based on the change in network environment. Overall objective of the research work is to improve the efficiency and self configurability of the IDS in a dynamic and changing environment.","","978-1-4799-6928-9","","10.1109/CICN.2014.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065647","Intrusion Detection System;SNORT;Signature Database","Classification algorithms;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Intrusion detection;distributed signature database;heterogeneous computer network;network traffic;self tuning IDS","","0","","21","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","","978-1-4244-7271-0","","10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380","Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","20","","","13-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We performed experiments on three datasets, namely, the traditional UNM dataset as well as two modern datasets, Firefox and ADFA-LD.

Rule learning, neural networks, statistics, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are some of the kinds of representative methods for intrusion detection. Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously.

The shared feature set consisted of features agreed by the two feature selection algorithms and therefore considered important features for identifying intrusions. Human intervention was then conducted to find an optimal number of features in between the combined (maximum) and shared feature sets (minimum).

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","0","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy","","0-7803-9788-6","","10.1109/IRI.2006.252413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490","","Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN","clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approaches outperform those used in [1].","","","","10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232998","Anomaly intrusion detection;Audit trail analysis;Intrusion detection;Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis;Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrices;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","data analysis;principal component analysis;security of data;vectors","KFDA;KPCA;anomaly intrusion detection method;data analysis method;discriminant factor;discrimination rule;kernel fisher discriminant analysis;kernel principal component analysis;vector","","0","","13","","","25-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The agent neighbouring consists of IDS agents of local neighbour nodes. The goal of such an approach is to consolidate the decision, regarding every suspected security event. Unlike previous works having proposed distributed systems for intrusion detection, our system is not restricted to data sharing. It proceeds in the case of a conflict to a negotiation between neighbouring agents in order to produce a consensual decision. So, the proposed system is fully distributed. It does not require any central or hierarchical control, which compromises its scalability, specially in wide area networks such as Internet. Indeed, in this kind of networks, some attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) require fully distributed defence. Experiments on our system show its potential for satisfactory DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4799-3019-7","","10.1109/INISTA.2014.6873596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873596","DDoS;IDS;Intrusion detection;Multi-agent systems;Network security","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Internet;Intrusion detection;Multi-agent systems;Wide area networks","Internet;computer network security;multi-agent systems;wide area networks","IDS;Internet;agent neighbouring;collective intrusion detection;data sharing;distributed denial of service;distributed system;local neighbour nodes;multiagent paradigm;satisfactory DDoS attack detection;security data;security event;wide area networks","","0","","15","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, a quantitative and metrics based evaluation of IDSs is desired. We propose testbed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (TIDeS), that allows a user to select the best IDS for a specific customized environment.

In this paper, we propose a novel motion detection and tracking method using passive RFID tags, named Twins. The method leverages a phenomenon called critical state caused by interference among passive tags. We theoretically explain this phenomenon via an interference model and conduct extensive experiment to validate it. We design a practical Twins based intrusion detection system and implement a real prototype with commercial off-the-shelf reader and tags.

Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware. However; Snort detection capability is not improved by improving hardware and is dependent upon its internal architecture (signature database and rate filtration).

The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets or timing jitter. Such evasion techniques cause most of the previous timing-based detection algorithms to fail. In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others. We examine the selected parameters and provide different trade-offs among false rates.

This paper presents hybrid detection for zero-day polymorphic shellcodes (HDPS) against shellcodes using various obfuscations. Our approach employs a heuristic approach to detect return address and filter mass innocent network flows, and then constructs a Markov model to detect the existence and location of executable codes in suspicious flows. Finally, it applies an elaborate approach to detect NOP Sleds in the executable codes. Initial experiments show HDPS detects nearly all types of shellcodes, and the false positive rate approximates zero with low overhead.","","978-1-4244-2909-7","978-1-4244-2910-3","10.1109/EBISS.2009.5137874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137874","","Buffer overflow;Computer architecture;Computer science;Genetic mutations;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Statistics","Internet;Markov processes;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;Markov model;NOP Sleds detection;complex obfuscation technique;heuristic approach;hybrid zero-day polymorphic shellcode detection approach;mass innocent network flow filtering;state-of-the-art NIDS;suspicious flow","","1","","10","","","23-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Lightweight IDS Based on Features Selection and IDS Classification Scheme","Zaman, S.; Karray, F.","ECE Dept., Univ. of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada","Computational Science and Engineering, 2009. CSE '09. International Conference on","20091009","2009","3","","365","370","The intrusion detection system (IDS) deals with huge amount of data which contains irrelevant and redundant features causing slow training and testing process, higher resource consumption as well as poor detection rate. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of lightweight IDS. The lightweight IDSs are small, powerful, and flexible enough to be used as permanent elements of the network security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility. To design the proposed system, several experiments have been conducted, and they indicate that the proposed lightweight IDS can deliver satisfactory system performance.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283334","Intrusion Detection Systems;Support Decision Function;features classification.;features ranking;features selection","Data engineering;Fuzzy sets;IP networks;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Scalability;System performance;System testing;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;support vector machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP/IP network model;application layer IDS;feature selection;fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function algorithm;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS classification scheme;link layer IDS;network layer IDS;network security;transport layer IDS","","1","","25","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research work focuses on two techniques for detecting a DoS attack at a medium access control (MAC) layer. Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.","","978-1-4673-2164-8","","10.1109/HPCC.2012.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332322","Denial of Service;Neural Network;Security;Support Vector Machine;Wireless Sensor Networks","Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;real-time systems;support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attack probability detection;MAC;SVM;WSN;denial of service;machine learning;medium access control;neural network;real-time system monitoring;security enhancement;security flaw;support vector machine;wireless sensor network","","1","","14","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multiple classification systems (MCS), or ensemble techniques, involve considering several classification methods or multiple outputs from the same method and devising techniques to reach a decision. The performance of a binary classification system can be measured on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the curve (AUC) is exactly the Wilcoxon rank sum or Mann-Whitney U statistic, both of which are nonparametric statistics based upon ranked data. Successful performance of an unsupervised ensemble can be measured through the AUC, and the performance of different aggregation techniques for the combination of the multiple classification system decision values, or rankings in this paper, is illustrated. Aggregation techniques are based upon fuzzy logic theory, creating the fuzzy ROC curve.

The limitation of information sources may lead a system to make inaccurate decisions. In this paper, we propose a Mobile Agent Based Peer-to-Peer Distributed Intrusion Detection Framework. Agents are included in this framework to achieve intrusion detections. In addition, a mobile agent migration strategy is applied in the framework to allow agents not only to collect information from direct-linked ""neighbours"" but also other hosts in the network.

Our first step toward this objective is to develop a prototype database and query interface to identify coordinated scanning activity in network attack data. We have created a set of aggregate views and templatized SQL queries that consider timing, persistence, targeted services, spatial dispersion and temporal dispersion, thereby enabling us to evaluate coordinated scanning along these dimensions. We demonstrate the utility of the interface by conducting a case study on a set of firewall and intrusion detection system logs from Dshield.org. We show that the interface is able to identify general characteristics of coordinated activity as well as instances of unusual activity that would otherwise be difficult to mine from the data. These results highlight the potential for developing a more generalized query language for a broad class of network intrusion data.

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation. Our experimental results show that EliMet can optimally make use of prior knowledge as well as automated inference techniques to minimize human involvement and efficiently deduce the expert knowledge regarding individual states of that particular system.","1530-0889","978-1-4673-1624-8","978-1-4673-1623-1","10.1109/DSN.2012.6263941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263941","Power grid critical infrastructure;intrusion detection and response;security metric;situational awareness","Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Security","control engineering computing;inference mechanisms;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system protection;power system security","EliMet;automated inference techniques;bulk electricity delivery system;complex power-grid control network protection;power grid critical infrastructures;security assessment techniques;security incidents;security measures;security metric elicitation","","4","","42","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored.

It applies some special routing protocols, e.g. Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, having the ability to forward the packets in dynamic network topology. The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the flooding attack by applying multiple nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) algorithm to identify the flooding attacker nodes. It also takes the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the flooding attack and after applying the proposed REHIDAN algorithm is tested. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN algorithm reduces the effect of the attack by reducing the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","","978-1-4244-4704-6","978-1-4244-3474-9","10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5010583","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay effects;Floods;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Testing","mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","dynamic network topology;flooding attack;on-demand distance vector routing protocol;real-time host intrusion detection;wireless ad-hoc networks","","2","","15","","","28-30 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose to support such applications by allowing the developer to annotate some transaction blocks with deadlines. Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies. We have also extended the Linux scheduler to disable preemption or migration of threads that are executing transactions with deadlines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves the chance of a transaction meeting its deadline when its progress is hampered by conflicts.","1530-0889","978-1-4244-9232-9","978-1-4244-9231-2","10.1109/DSN.2011.5958224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958224","Contention Management;Scheduling;Transactional Memory","Games;Instruction sets;Linux;Optimized production technology;Rendering (computer graphics);Reservoirs;Runtime","Linux;concurrency control;multi-threading;scheduling;shared memory systems;transaction processing","Deadline-Aware Scheduling;Linux scheduler;Software Transactional Memory;concurrency control;conservative execution;parallel programs;thread migration;transaction execution strategy","","1","","25","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All the data are stored across the globe and maintained by the cloud service providers i.e., the responsibility of the data is in the hands of cloud providers. The data breach is a biggest problem in cloud as the data are shared across the globe and sensitive information of the customer is stored at some third party storage site. Security of the data is the major concern in cloud from outsiders as well as insiders. Insider attack is the most devastating threat due to the familiarity of the underlying system to the insiders. The proposed approach mitigates this threat by a host based user profiling technique where a key stroke dynamics is used for analyzing the user behavior and a retraining approach is also proposed as the imposter patterns are absent at the time of registration. Retraining boosts the overall system performance in mitigating the insider threat.","","","","10.1109/CCEM.2014.7015481","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015481","","Authentication;Iris recognition;Monitoring;Presses;Support vector machines;Vectors","behavioural sciences computing;cloud computing;security of data;user interfaces","cloud computing;cloud service providers;data breach;data security;host based user profiling technique;insider attack;insider threat;key stroke dynamics;keystroke dynamics;malicious insiders;sensitive information;system performance;user behavior","","0","","34","","","15-17 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach first extracts behavioral features to train classifiers using data mining techniques that can distinguish malicious and benign executables, and then host level agents are introduced to block the execution of malware instances with their content-based fingerprints. To increase accuracy, an algorithm is proposed that applies a classifier to raw audit data as well as observes the executions of malware in virtualized environments. Moreover, distributed system architecture is used to optimize efficiency and real-time containment.

The first contribution lies in reducing the false alarm rate of the attack detection in an agent-based architecture by using honeypot network as the closer level of investigation. The connection is retrieved to the original destination in case of false alarm recognition, while the actions are hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS. The second contribution applies the game theoretic analysis in the sense that the contributing agents are led to perform the best they could in order to achieve their goals. The Shaply value is computed to find the actual contribution of each agent in the coalition he belongs to. The equilibrium point is found and consequently the winner coalition is formed.

Although naive selfish strategies based on dropping data packets are readily detected, more sophisticated strategies that manipulate ad hoc routing protocols present a greater challenge. In this work we develop a method to distinguish selfish peers from cooperative ones based solely on local observations of AODV routing protocol behavior. Our approach uses the finite state machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build up a statistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We apply a series of well-known statistical tests to features derived from this description to partition the set neighboring nodes into a cooperative and selfish class. Simulation results for a non-mobile ad hoc network show that our approach can detect two different types of routing manipulation while maintaining a low rate of false positives.","1087-4089","0-7695-2509-1","","10.1109/ISPAN.2005.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1575855","","Ad hoc networks;Automata;Automatic testing;Bandwidth;Computer science;Data mining;Intelligent networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;finite state machines;routing protocols;statistical testing","AODV routing protocol;finite state machine;free-rider;nonmobile ad hoc network;reputation mechanism;selfish peer;selfish routing behavior;statistical description;statistical test","","5","","15","","","7-9 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude. The results also show that the software implementation of our scheme without using any hardware parallelism can support up to one thousand customer VLANs and one million rules, where each rule consumes less than 60 bytes and each packet classification can be accomplished under 50 memory accesses.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.140112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689489","Packet classification;VLANs;datacenter network;firewalls;packet forwarding;router architectures;scalability","Data structures;Decision trees;Encoding;Hardware;IP networks;Indexes;Software","computer centres;firewalls;local area networks;telecommunication network routing;virtual machines","VLAN;classification rules;datacenter networks;encoded rule expansion;hardware parallelism;hash table;length combinations;packet classification;packet forwarding;storage penalty","","1","","48","","","January 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682694","","Conferences;Degradation;Fingerprint recognition;Games;IP networks;Probes;Security","Internet;computer network security;game theory;operating systems (computers)","DeceiveGame;Internet;Nash equilibrium;counter-fingerprinting;dynamic mechanism;game-theoretic approach;remote operating system fingerprinting;selective mechanism","","0","","19","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
