We base our method on the belief that legitimate users can be classified into categories based on the percentage of commands they use in a specified period. The hybrid approach we employ begins with the application of expert rules to reduce the dimensionality of the data, followed by an initial clustering of the data and subsequent refinement of the cluster locations using a competitive network called Learning Vector Quantization. Since Learning Vector Quantization is a nearest neighbor classifier, and new record presented to the network that lies outside a specified distance is classified as a masquerader.

Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network.

Often called “intrusion location capability”, this capability also presents inherent features such as; more accuracy in camera pre-set positioning, temporary disabling of sub-zone and individual sensitivity level per sub-zone. However, even though the market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact on the overall system cost. The paper shows how synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length. In other word, for a typical zone length of 100 meters, the zone is subdivided in to up to ten equally spaced sub-zones of 10 meters each, giving an intrusion crossing point resolution of 10 meters. Synergistic radar technology can be applied to buried, surface, wall and roof applications.

So optimization methods using dynamic traffic characteristics are exploited. Our contributions lie in three folds. Firstly, a novel best classification tree is formally defined aiming to minimize the visit cost of the traffic in the slot, based on which optimization methods are exploited. Secondly, Packet Feature Entropy is proposed to measure how efficiently a packet field can partition the traffic, and the popular 14 packet fields used in Snort are investigated in detail by 10Gbps backbone trace and Netflow data.

Apart from reducing the processing overhead through minimization of the feature space, the autonomous identification of such sub-groups of features can readily enable IDS's to develop classifiers that are more apt at separating normal traffic from anomalous traffic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this techniques by generating feature sets from a collection of network traffic and applying them to the training and detection phases of a payload-based IDS.

The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples.

We show analytically and empirically that our proposed estimators can better infer worm temporal characteristics than a naive estimator that has been used in the previous work. We also demonstrate that our estimators can be applied to worms using different scanning strategies such as random scanning and localized scanning.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2011.2161288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5940226","Darknet;Internet worms;network security;statistical estimation;worm-scanning strategies","Computer security;Computer worms;IP networks;Linear regression;Maximum likelihood estimation;Moment methods;Tomography","Internet;estimation theory;invasive software;regression analysis","IP address space;Internet worm attacks;Internet worm temporal characteristics;Internet worm tomography;darknet-based inference;host infection time;linear regression estimator method;localized scanning;maximum likelihood method;moment method;network management;network security;random scanning;statistical estimation techniques;worm infection sequence","","3","","38","","2011-07-04","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As underlying devices in SDN, SDN switches must maintain a large number of hardware counters. Implementation of these counters faces serious challenges for SDN switches, i.e., High memory consumption and inflexibility. Thus, we previously proposed Software Defined Hardware Counters (SDHC), which decouples definition and implementation of counters to overcome these challenges. However, like traditional hardware counters, SDHC only supports passive statistical mode (i.e., The values of the counters can be only read passively by the controller). Based on the passive mode, most of applications need to send request messages at some frequency to obtain statistics, which causes some critical problems for SDN: i) low statistical accuracy, ii) high network bandwidth consumption. Hyper Software Defined Hardware Counters (Hyper SDHC) is thus proposed by extending SDHC. Through introducing the timer-triggering and updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms, Hyper SDHC can naturally support active statistical mode, i.e., Counters actively report their values according to triggering condition. It can greatly enhance the statistical accuracy and reduce network bandwidth consumption between controller and switch. The demo of Hyper SDHC is implemented based on Net Magic platform. The demo will exhibit how Hyper SDHC works and how it supports a typical video quality monitor application.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037744","Software Defined Networking (SDN);active statistical mode;counters","Bandwidth;Hardware;Radiation detectors;Real-time systems;Software;Switches","software defined networking;statistical analysis","Net Magic platform;SDHC;SDN switches;hyper software defined hardware counters;low statistical accuracy;network bandwidth consumption;software defined networking;timer-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms;updating-triggering statistics-reporting mechanisms","","0","","8","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations.

Attack prevention measures, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. Intrusion detection on MANET is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management and highly resource constrained nodes. Conventional intrusion detection system developed for wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET. It needs to be redesigned to suit the ad hoc technology. The proposed system introduces new architecture that uses machine learning approach to maximize the detection accuracy. Proposed IDS architecture uses the combination of Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make use of the excellent accuracy of SVM and better performance of RST.","","978-1-4799-3835-3","","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033949","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning;Mobile ad hoc Networks;Rough Set Theory and Support Vector Machine;Security issues","Approximation methods;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Set theory;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","IDS architecture;MANET;RST;SVM;ad hoc technology;attack prevention measures;authentication techniques;centralized management;dynamic topology;encryption;highly resource constrained nodes;instant wireless networking;intrusion detection systems;machine learning;mobile ad hoc networking;mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security problems;support vector machine;temporary network life;wired networks;wireless devices","","0","","10","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DDoS attacks often overwhelm or exhaust the resources of victims and typically result in abnormal bursty traffic passing through victim systems. In this paper, we develop a mechanism for diagnosing traffic anomalies caused by DDoS attacks on the basis of analyzing the behaviour of network traffic. The traffic in communication networks has been shown to exhibit statistical self-similar phenomena that can be characterized by the so-called Hurst parameter. Therefore, in the proposed mechanism the Hurst parameter coupled by variance and autocorrelation are employed as the key performance metrics to spot the anomalies of network traffic. The proposed diagnosis mechanism is validated through experiments where the datasets consist of two groups. The first group is obtained from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset. The second group is collected from our DDoS attack simulation experiments, which cover three representative traffic shapes resulting from three different DDoS attack behaviours, namely, constant intensity, ramp-up behaviour and pulse behaviour. The experimental results show that the developed mechanism can alert the DDoS attack schemes within short respond time.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295984","Anomaly diagnosis;DDoS attack;Intrusion detection;Traffic measurement","Computer crime;Correlation;Data models;Servers;Standards;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack behaviours;DDoS attack simulation experiments;Hurst parameter;MIT Lincoln Laboratory DOS attack dataset;abnormal bursty traffic;constant intensity;distributed denial-of-service attacks;network traffic anomaly;network traffic behaviour analysis;pulse behaviour;ramp-up behaviour;real-time diagnosis;statistical self-similar phenomena;statistical traffic analysis","","3","","18","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system that shares normal behavior data between multiple machines. In the proposed system, normal behavior data obtained on each machine is accumulated in a server and the integrated data is distributed to each machine.This system improves the detection accuracy by integrating the data used for anomaly detection on each machine. The proposed system not only provides a straightforward algorithm for integration, but also two improved algorithms, namely, the majority algorithm and the similarity algorithm.

Furthermore, comparison with the result of a dynamic invariant detector reveals 17,182 variables that can cause false alarms for the dynamic detector.

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

The framework includes author behavior categories, which are the set of characteristics that remain relatively constant for a large number of messages written by the author. Specific topics include user pattern analysis, user profiling, categorization, computational linguistics, data mining, and anomaly detection. The experiments focus on applying character frequency analysis to IM messages for authorship identification and validation. This addresses the questions; can we identify an author of an IM conversation based strictly on user behavior, do different conversations with a single user look similar, do conversations with different users look different, and what is the demarcation between similar and different? Another experiment focuses on applying an instance-based learning algorithm to the character frequency of IM user messages for authorship identification and validation. The experiment applies the nearest-neighbor classification method to classify messages. It also calculates a degree of confidence to validate the identity of the IM user","","1-4244-0174-7","","10.1109/CCST.2006.313445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4105332","","Communication effectiveness;Computer crime;Data mining;Forensics;Frequency;Humans;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Social network services;Writing","Internet;authorisation;electronic messaging;learning systems;pattern classification;telecommunication security","anomaly detection;author profiling;authorship identification;authorship validation;character frequency analysis;computational linguistics;data mining;instance-based learning;instant messaging;intrusion detection system;nearest-neighbor classification;user behavior;user categorization;user pattern analysis;user profiling","","2","","16","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

People have increasingly attached importance to research on software testing management method. The current main problem in software testing management research is how to effectively manage the whole software testing process. Through research on V Model and W Model in software testing management, these models have themselves inherent limitations and are largely impractical. Reflective architectures are used to allow a software system to define its behavior at runtime based on information that can be stored in metadata. This paper proposes RATMM - reflective architecture based software testing management model. The model integrates reflection theory and software architecture design method, constructed software testing management model by using meta-information theory and meta-model method. RATMM is logically divided into meta-level and base-level. Meta-level and base-level are interrelated. Meta object captures condition and behavior of base-level, meta-level makes the corresponding metacomputing. Meta-level reflects the changes in meta-information to base-level after computing. Based on the description of its own condition and behavior, RATMM can adjust the testing process, obtain information about structure and behavior of testing process, and build software testing management model by reflective architecture. The model allows the user to modify condition of a software testing process without programming. RATMM exists in the entire testing life cycle, as well as verifies and confirms the whole process of the system","","1-4244-0147-X","1-4244-0148-8","10.1109/ICMIT.2006.262335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4037133","","Application software;Computer architecture;Design methodology;Internet;Metacomputing;Reflection;Runtime;Software architecture;Software systems;Software testing","program testing;software architecture;software management","Internet;RATMM model;V Model;W Model;meta-information theory;meta-model method;reflection theory;reflective architecture based software testing management model;software architecture design method","","0","","14","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, unlike devices that have a limited and predefined set of functionality, recent mobile smart phone devices have a very rich set of components and can handle multiple general purpose programs that are not a-priori known or profiled. In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi. To achieve that, we make use of the per-subsystem time shares reported by the operating system's power-management module. We present the models capability to further calculate the power consumption of individual applications given measurements, and also the feasibility of our model to operate in real-time and without significant impact in the power footprint of the devices we monitor.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","","10.1109/SERE.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258304","energy model;power usage measurements;smart handheld devices","Brightness;Discharges (electric);Image color analysis;Mobile communication;Performance evaluation;Power demand;Power measurement","","","","12","","20","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tasks from different users may be performed on the same machine. Therefore, one primary security concern is whether user data is secure in cloud. On the other hand, hacker may facilitate cloud computing to launch larger range of attack, such as a request of port scan in cloud with multiple virtual machines executing such malicious action. The hacker may perform a sequence of attacks in order to compromise his target system in a cloud, for example, compromsing an easy-to-exploit machine in the cloud and then using the compromised to attack the target. Such attack plan may be stealthy or inside the computing environment, so intrusion detection system or firewall has difficulty to identify it. The proposed detection system analyzes multiple logs from the cloud and extracts the intensions of the actions recorded in the logs. Stealthy reconnaissance actions are often neglected by administrator for the insignificant number of violations. Hidden Markov model is adopted to model the steps of the attack plan performed by hacker and such stealthy events in a long time frame will become significant in the state-aware model.

Proceedings","20030225","2002","2","","1503","1508 vol.2","Traditional intrusion detection systems can be broadly classified as misuse and anomaly detectors. Misuse detectors attempt detection by matching the current system/user activity against known signatures and patterns. As opposed to this, anomaly detection works by developing a reference graph and comparing the ongoing activity against it. Any significant deviation is flagged as an intrusion. Anomaly detection is more promising because of its potential to detect unseen types of attacks. However, both techniques have conventionally relied on audit trails sampled deep inside the system via probes and the sheer size of the data allows only after-the-fact and off line detection. In recent past, there have been efforts to capture the semantics of system activity for more rapid detection and this can typically be done at levels closer to the user. In our earlier works related to this effort, we presented a scheme and a reasoning framework to detect intrusions based on the encapsulated user intent. This paper addresses the scalability and implementation aspects of the system by introducing concepts such as workspaces and meta-operations. Although this security system is a general anomaly detection system, it is amenable to operator fault recovery. While encryption provides secure communication channels, it leaves the end points exposed. Our security system has the additional capability of handling insider attacks relevant in this context.","","0-7803-7625-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179706","","Communication channels;Communication system security;Context;Cryptography;Detectors;Fault detection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Probes;Scalability","computer network management;graphs;military communication;military computing;telecommunication security","encapsulated user intent;exposed end points;insider attacks;meta-operations;operator fault recovery;reasoning framework;reference graph;scalable implementation;user level anomaly detection system;workspaces","","3","","31","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In adhoc networks, routes may be disconnected due to dynamic movement of nodes. So, route selection and topology combination is very difficult and challenging issue. Such networks are more vulnerable to both internal and external attacks due to presence of bad neighbor nodes. Observed problem affects performance of routing protocol in adhoc networks. In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network. Besides, this approach is extended by adding extra parameters i.e. signal strength, flow capacity and relative position of a node in to the account.

The novelty of our approach results from the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. Our algorithm uses a semiglobal alignment and a unique scoring system to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder and the user signature, which is a sequence of commands collected from a legitimate user. We tested this algorithm on the standard intrusion data collection set.

An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power while switching of gates and reduces the wiring-crises. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that makes use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness.

It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","1","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Conventional hierarchical routing protocols were not created considering security; they are helpless against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the event that the information supply process is hampered and in this way the normal administrations get to be inaccessible because of the purposeful endeavors of the enemies, we consider this as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. So in order to address this issue and to disseminate the computational heap of detection complexity among the cluster heads rather than the sink nodes, a distributed intrusion detection scheme (IDS) is developed. Among the various Denial of Service attacks, Flooding attacks consumes the maximum battery life of the sensor node, on the other hand Gray hole attack consumes the minimum battery life of the nodes.

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS. These simulations will quantify network throughput and device battery usage in large scale network deployments that are, and are not, using B-SIPS.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3450-3","","10.1109/HICSS.2009.394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755621","","Batteries;Bluetooth;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection;Research initiatives;Sensor systems;Testing;Throughput","Bluetooth;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Battery-Sensing Intrusion Protection System research;Bluetooth;Wi-Fi;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;device battery usage;mobile devices;multi-vector attacks;network deployment validation;network simulations;network throughput;saturated network environment;throughput degradation;transmission rate","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.","","978-1-4577-1459-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432","","Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training","Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing","CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs","","1","","18","","","5-6 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While popular systems like Snort are used in many network locations, comprehensive deployment across Tier-1 service provider networks is costly due to the need for high-speed monitors at many network ingress points. Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow- alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof- of-concept. We evaluate prediction accuracy of candidate ML algorithms on actual packet traces. The duration of prediction effectiveness is an issue for ML approaches and more so in resource intensive network applications. Initial results show little impairment of performance over periods of one or two weeks.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061947","","Buffer overflow;Communications Society;Computer worms;Costs;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication traffic","IP flow;Tier-1 service provider network;machine learning approach;network security;network traffic;network-wide flow-alarming architecture;packet classification;rule-based anomaly detection","","11","","19","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In cases where the investigation cannot rely on the cooperation of the hosting provider, or where documentation is not available, investigators can often find the identification of which distinct server among many is of interest difficult and extremely time consuming. To address the problem of identifying these servers, in this paper a new approach to rapidly and reliably identify these cloud hosting computer systems is presented. In the outlined approach, a handheld device composed of an embedded computer combined with a method of undetectable interception of Ethernet based communications is presented. This device is tested and evaluated, and a discussion is provided on its usefulness in identifying of server of interest to an investigation.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2015.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299923","","Computers;Hardware;Local area networks;Ports (Computers);Relays;Servers;Software","cloud computing;digital forensics;embedded systems;local area networks","Ethernet based communications;cloud hosted servers;cloud hosting computer systems;cloud-based data centres;cybercrime investigations;embedded computer;evidence;forensic identification;forensic investigation;handheld device;hosting providers;noninvasive wiretaps;server identification","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection. A hybrid detection framework is developed to detect anomalous and malicious activities by incorporating our proposed grid sensor placement algorithm with observability analysis to increase the detection rate. Our simulations have shown that the network observability and detection accuracy can be improved by means of grid-placed sensor deployment.","2168-6750","","","10.1109/TETC.2013.2274043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6563147","Smart grid;cyber-physical security;energy theft;false data injection attack;intrusion detection;observability;sensor placement;state estimation","Current measurement;Energy management;Network security;Network topology;Power measurement;Real-time systems;Sensors;Smart grids;Smart meters;State estimation","power distribution protection;safety systems;sensor placement;smart meters;smart power grids","CONSUMER attack model;FDI;coin change problems;combination sum of energy profiles attack;electricity bills;energy consumption reading;energy theft;false data injection;grid sensor placement algorithm;hybrid detection framework;observability analysis;physical attack;power distribution systems;real-time communications;smart meters","","0","","51","","2013-07-18","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Providing attacks' signatures is costly, time consuming and with the explosive growing number of zero day attacks, using misuse detection mechanism is not an efficient solution. Other techniques which applied on NIDS are supervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection systems which can detect novel attacks by comparing the current behavior of the network to the training sample; however producing labeled or attack-free dataset is difficult for training the engine. Current NIDS solutions monitor bytes, packets' payload or network flows to detect intrusions. Today it is difficult to monitor the payload of packets in high speed network (1-10 Gbps) and recent network attacks are becoming more complex and analyzing only the payload of packets will not produce enough information for detection engine. In this paper we propose a new Real Time Unsupervised Network Intrusion Detection System (RTUNIDS) which monitor network flows in two windows with different sizes and detects network attacks by correlating outliers from multiple clusters. The proposed solution has the ability of detecting different types of intrusions in realtime such as DOS, DDOS, scanning, distribution of worms and any other network attacks which produce huge amount of network traffic and in the meanwhile it detects Bot-Master if the detected attack lunched by Bots.","","978-1-4673-5137-9","","10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747642","","Engines;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","Bot-Master detection;DDOS;NIDS solutions;RTU-NIDS;attack-free dataset;byte monitoring;engine training;misuse detection mechanism;network behavior matching;network flow monitoring;network traffic;packet payload monitoring;predefined attack signatures;real time multistage unsupervised intelligent engine;real time unsupervised network intrusion detection system;scanning;semisupervised anomaly detection systems;unknown attack detection rate enhancement;worm distribution;zero day attacks","","0","","27","","","23-25 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in the presence of attackers, reliable and trustworthy operations in such networks become impossible without securing routing protocols. In this paper, we target to study and design a secure routing protocol S-GyTAR for vehicular environments. Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator. Simulation results show high performances regarding the detection rate of malicious nodes and overhead with an amelioration of the end-to-end communication delay in the presence of malicious vehicles.","","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036788","Clustering;Monitoring;Reputation;Routing;Security;VANET","Ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Roads;Routing;Routing protocols;Vehicles","routing protocols;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","NS3 simulator;S-GyTAR;VANET;data collection;data routing;distributed trust management strategy;greedy forwarding technique;secure intersection-based routing protocol;urban vehicular networks","","0","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
