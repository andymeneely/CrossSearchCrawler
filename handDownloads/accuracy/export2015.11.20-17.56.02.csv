In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9919-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935169","","Electrostatic discharge;Maximum likelihood estimation;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Security","Internet;maximum likelihood detection;probability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","compact information storage;high-speed network;intrusion detection system;maximum likelihood estimation;memory consumption;on-die memory space;optimal dynamic bit sharing;probabilistic sampling;probability;real Internet traffic trace;scan detection","","1","","20","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set).

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","30","1","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type ""opportunistic adversaries"". This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions.

P self is specified in terms of legal traces of system calls and of assertions on P status paired with each call. In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions. Lastly, a preliminary evaluation of the run-time overhead is discussed.","1066-6192","978-0-7695-3544-9","","10.1109/PDP.2009.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4912959","introspection;intrusion detection system;sense of self;static analysis;virtual machines","Condition monitoring;Law;Legal factors;Libraries;Protection;Robustness;Runtime;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing","context-free grammars;operating system kernels;program diagnostics;virtual machines","PsycoTrace run-time tool;assertion evaluation;context-free grammar;introspection tool;legal trace;operating system kernel module;source code;static analysis;system call;transparent process self monitoring;virtual machine;virtual process self monitoring","","1","","16","","","18-20 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results presented here are specific to residential DR but the approach is general and it could be applied to other systems within the Smart Grid and to other critical infrastructure domains. Our architecture-based analysis is different from most other approaches to analyzing complex systems in that it addresses multiple quality attributes simultaneously (e.g., performance, reliability, security, modifiability, usability, etc.) and it considers the architecture of a complex system from a socio-technical perspective where the actions of the people in the system are as important, from an analysis perspective, as the physical and computational elements of the system.

Data collected from IoT is usually offloaded to the Cloud which may further leave data prone to a variety of attacks if security and privacy issues are not handled properly. Anomaly detection has been one of the widely adopted security measures in wired and wireless networks. However, it is not straight forward to apply most of the anomaly detection techniques to IoT and cloud. One of the main challenges is deriving outlier features from the vast volume of data pumped from IoT to the cloud. Other challenges include the large number of sources generating data, heterogenous connectivity and traffic patterns of IoT devices, cloud services being offered at geographically remote places and causing IoT data to be stored in different countries with different legislations. This paper, for the first time, presents the challenges and opportunities in anomaly detection for IoT and cloud. It first introduces the prominent features and application fields of IoT and Cloud, then discusses security and privacy risks to personal information and finally focuses on solutions from anomaly detection perspective.","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247572","","Big data;Cloud computing;Internet of things;Privacy;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Web services;cloud computing;data privacy;security of data","IoT concept;IoT devices;anomaly detection techniques;cloud services;cloud-centric Internet of Things;personal information;privacy breach;privacy preservation;privacy risks;security breach;security risks;wired networks;wireless networks","","","","33","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In terms of information security, incrementing the intrusion detection rate on anomaly attacks and decreasing the high false positive rate has been the two major concerns for every sysadmin. The huge amount of logs generated by different assets in the network are not always capable to be correlated and reviewed to determine possible security breaches. We implemented a new reliable and scalable classification-based hybrid IPS that can easily manage the processing of all the authentication log information of different IPSs in the network. This enhanced framework can determine in a more precise manner if a communication can be considered legitimate or an intrusion. This classification method increases the intrusion detection rate and decreases the false positive rate. Our main objective in this paper is to enforce redundancy on different modules of the framework.

That is, given two arbitrary machines, A and B, on the Internet, our technique measures the round trip time from A to B. We take advantage of information side-channels that are present in the TCP/IP network stack of modern Linux kernels to infer information about off-path routes. Compared to previous tools, ours does not require additional resources, machines, or require additional protocols beyond TCP. The only requirements are that one end host have an open port and be running a modern Linux kernel and that the other end host responds to unsolicited SYN-ACK packets with a RST packet. We evaluate our technique “in the wild” and compare our off-path estimates to on-path measurements. Our experiments show that our technique provides accurate, real-time estimates of off-path network latency. In over 80% of measurements our technique provides off-path round trip time measurements within 20% of the actual round trip time. We also discuss possible causes of errors that impact the accuracy of our measurements.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218538","","Extraterrestrial measurements;IP networks;Kernel;Linux;Loss measurement;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;telecommunication channels;transport protocols","Internet;Linux kernel;RST packet;TCP-IP network stack protocol;TCP-IP side channel;off-path round trip time measurement;round trip time network latency estimation;unsolicited SYN-ACK packet","","0","","22","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method constructs a homogeneous Markov chain model to characterize the normal behavior of a privileged program, and associates the states of the Markov chain with the unique system calls in the training data. At the detection stage, the probabilities that the Markov chain model supports the system call sequences generated by the program are computed. A low probability indicates an anomalous sequence that may result from intrusive activities. Then a decision rule based on the number of anomalous sequences in a locality frame is adopted to classify the program's behavior. The method gives attention to both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and is especially suitable for on-line detection.

Drug delivery and environmental control are only two of the many interesting application domains, which, at the same time, pose many new challenging problems. Very relevant communication concepts have been investigated such as RF radio communication in the terra hertz band or molecular communication based on transmitter molecules. Yet, one question has not been considered so far and that is nano communication security, i.e., will it be possible to protect such systems from manipulation by malicious parties? Our objective is to provide some first insights into the security challenges and to highlight some of the open research challenges in this field. The main observation is that especially for molecular communication existing security and cryptographic solutions might not be applicable.

First, the double-loop structure is improved by adding a certain length of transmission fiber in the start and end of each loop which enhances the linear relationship between amplitude and distance.

Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200273","Anomaly detection;least squares;online updating;oversampling;principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Data models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Memory management;Principal component analysis","","","","4","","26","","2012-05-15","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes a semantic based intrusion detection scheme where state transition analysis, pattern matching and data mining techniques are integrated to maximize the detection accuracy. Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder.

In this paper we explore the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for such a purpose. Although GP has already been studied for this task, the inner features of network intrusion detection have been systematically ignored. To avoid the blind use of GP shown in previous research, we guide the search by means of a fitness function based on recent advances on IDS evaluation. For the experimental work we use a well-known dataset (i.e. KDD-99) that has become a standard to compare research although its drawbacks. Results clearly show that an intelligent use of GP achieves systems that are comparable (and even better in realistic conditions) to top state-of-the-art proposals in terms of effectiveness, improving them in efficiency and simplicity.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438073","effectiveness;efficiency;genetic programming;intrusion detection","Availability;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Telecommunication traffic","genetic algorithms;security of data","domain-aware genetic programming;fitness function;intrusive traffic;network intrusion detection;normal traffic","","2","","22","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this approach, the inconsistencies often seen in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements are handled with a minimum of calibration. By taking off-line calibration measurement of a ZigBee sensor network, the inherent problem of signal uncertainty of to-be-localized nodes can be effectively resolved. The proposed RSSI-based algorithm allows flexible deployment of sensor nodes in various environments. The proposed algorithm has been verified in several typical environments and experiments show that the method outperforms existing algorithms. The location aware system has been integrated with an autonomous mobile robot to demonstrate the proposed on-demand robotic intruder detection system.

Traditionally, the signature matching engine compares the signature with a single audit data stream to identify occurrences of the action sequence described in the signature. Such approach introduces a single point of failure and uses huge bandwidth for transferring audit data from the data sources to the matching engine. Our approach decomposes an extended infinite state machine, an operational representation of an attack signature, into multiple cooperative finite state machines that enable distributed signature engines to match the signature. We describe the decomposition methodology and the distributed matching algorithm and illustrate them using several example multi-stage attacks in tactical networks. In addition, we implemented an example distributed signature matching engine for detecting the example attacks in a simulation framework based on MASON.

The problem is that the majority of visualization tools in practice or proposed do not take efficient visualization techniques into consideration. As a result, it is difficult to get a high-level view of the network that facilitates rapid isolation of network attacks. We propose the Converged Security Visualization Tool (Cover-VT) to solve the efficient visualization problem. Cover-VT was designed to provide analysts with a high-level view of network threats using geographic information systems. The tool allows for rapid identification of threats by minimizing the cognitive obstacles to efficient threat location. Cover-VT includes the capability to drill-down on a node of interest for additional details and even filter out unwanted data. Cover-VT was designed with usability in mind, making it easy to comprehend while assisting the analyst in rapid threat identification.

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","2","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime.

Although the detection of intrusions and attacks is the ultimate goal, the huge amount of generated alerts cannot be properly managed by the administrator. In order to improve the accuracy of sensors, we adopt a two-stage technique. The first one aims to generate meta-alerts through clustering and the second one aims to reduce the rate of false alarms using a binary classification of the generated meta-alerts. For the first stage we use two alternatives, self-organizing map (SOM) with k-means algorithm and neural GAS with fuzzy c-means algorithm.

The problem with such a system is that it cannot detect novel attacks whose signature is not available and hence generates a high rate of alerts. In this paper Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation algorithm is used to classify attacks. We train and test MLP with KDD99 training dataset. We use KDD99 dataset which is a subset of the DARPA dataset. It is a preprocessed dataset and is most suitable for our system. We analyze the working of MLP by performing various experiments.

It is important to determine the relationships between climatic factors and disease incidence trends, which would be helpful for relevant environment and health agencies in planning appropriate pre-emptive control measures. Climatic factors and dengue case records vary over time. It is therefore difficult to justify the time-lag when a climatic factor affects the mosquito-to-human and human-to-mosquito loops. In this paper, we propose to use support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for analyzing the time- series dengue data and genetic algorithm (GA), to determine the time-lags and subset of climatic factors as effective factors influencing the spread of dengue.

Therefore, we identify properties of botnet communications that will not be obscured by these measures. This allows us to design features which can be derived by measuring these properties and used as input to an approach for detecting systems infected with a botnet client.

To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches meet all of these requirements. Our store-through does this by forwarding each out-of-order or IP-fragmented packet immediately after copying it even if it has not been checked yet. Although the forwarded packet might turn out to be a part of an attack, the store-through can successfully defend against the attack by blocking one of the subsequent packets.

After examining the various existing defending mechanisms for WS, it is found that they are not adaptive and adequate in counter-measuring the WS attacks. An adaptive intrusion detection and prevention (ID/IP) framework to protect the WS against attacks related to SOAP/XML/SQL is thus introduced. Through illustration by examples, the framework demonstrated that by making use of agents that act as sensors, data mining techniques such as clustering, association and sequential rule coupled with fuzzy logic to further analyze and identify anomalies, is able to exhibit the adaptive nature of capturing anomalies and avoiding false alarms.","","0-7695-3038-9","","10.1109/ICCIT.2007.422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420313","","Computer crime;Electronic mail;Fuzzy logic;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Protection;Simple object access protocol;Web services;XML","Web services;security of data","Web service platform;Web service security;Web technology;adaptive intrusion detection;adaptive intrusion prevention","","7","","29","","","21-23 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless features leads to a simplified problem and enhance detection rate. By combining different selected features that will be evaluated, where this will lead us to determine suitable combination features to attain best results. In ESSGBML, Zeroth Level Classifier System (ZCS) plays the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether it is normal or intrusion.

Erdos Renyi model create the links (edges) in the network on the basis of two main parameters, number of nodes and average degree of the network. Infection in social network are information contents in any of the form like text, images, audio, video, animation etc. There are two main methods for spreading of content over web; conserved spread (SIS model) and non conserved spread (SIR model). This paper uses SI (Susceptible-Infected) model. Infection flow behaviour is analyzed by taking the data i.e. no of infected nodes of a social network in NetLogo environment and simulated for a different size and different average degree network taking input 100 times which helps in correction of data and improves the accuracy of the results. This paper shows that the information diffusion takes place highly between a particular range of average degree for any size network.","","","","10.1109/ICICICT.2014.6781343","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781343","Erdos Renyi model;SIS;SNA (Social Network Analysis)","Analytical models;Handheld computers","graph theory;information analysis;network theory (graphs);social networking (online)","Erdos Renyi method;NetLogo environment;content spread;infection flow behaviour;information diffusion behaviour;network degree;network nodes;social networks","","0","","24","","","7-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Digital forensic analysis of intrusions using alerts generated by existing intrusion detection system (IDS) faces major challenges, especially for IDS deployed in large networks. In this paper, the concept of automatically sifting through a huge volume of alerts to distinguish the different stages of a DDoS attack is developed. The proposed novel framework is purpose-built to analyze multiple logs from the network for proactive forecast and timely detection of DDoS attacks, through a combined approach of Shannon-entropy concept and clustering algorithm of relevant feature variables. Experimental studies on a cyber-range simulation dataset from the project industrial partners show that the technique is able to distinguish precursor alerts for DDoS attacks, as well as the attack itself with a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 22.5%. Application of this technique greatly assists security experts in network analysis to combat DDoS attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116055","Shannon entropy;alert management;distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) detection;k-means clustering analysis;network security;online anomaly detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;digital forensics;entropy;forecasting theory;pattern clustering","DDoS attacks;FPR;IDS;Shannon-entropy concept;clustering algorithm;cyber-range simulation dataset;digital forensic analysis;distributed denial-of-service;entropy clustering approach;false positive rate;forecasting;intrusion detection system;network analysis;proactive forecast;project industrial partner;volume anomaly","","0","","32","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But there are still some limitations in the algorithm of SOM, such as the algorithm is easy to get into the local minimum, detection accuracy is low, the convergence speed is slow and so on. In this paper, to improve the accuracy and convergence rate, we use Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to refine the weight of SOM. SA algorithm find the optimal point by a form of probability, and it is proved that if enough time is given, the SA can certainly find the optimal point. The algorithm is divided into two steps: first, use traditional SOM algorithm to train samples; second, adjust the weight of excited neuron and its neighborhoods by SA algorithm. The simulation experiment results illuminate that the application performs fairly more effective.","","978-1-4244-4132-7","978-1-4244-4134-1","10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305521","","Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Computer crime;Computer security;Genetics;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Organizing;Protection;Simulated annealing","pattern clustering;security of data;self-organising feature maps;simulated annealing","SOM clustering effect;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;misuse detection;self organizing map;simulated annealing;unsupervised learning","","1","","12","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Android OS uses permissions to control access to software and hardware components of the device. Therefore, depending on the combination of permissions allowed by the user, a different set of hardware components will be used and hence a particular device may experience different battery consumption patterns depending on the set of allowed permissions. In this position paper we provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of the relation between some popular Android permissions and battery consumption by the device while these permissions are allowed. While battery consumption is an issue in different platforms, we chose to study this on Android because of the user's involvement in the Android permission model. We are hoping that these results will be the basis of further investigation into battery usage profiling of different Android applications based on the analysis of their permission requests and usage.","","","","10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266526","Android;Battery Exhaustion;Permission;power profiling;power rating","Androids;Batteries;Battery charge measurement;Humanoid robots;Power demand;Power measurement;Smart phones","Android (operating system);power consumption;security of data;smart phones","Android permissions;battery consumption patterns;battery usage profiling;power profiling;smart phones;tablet computer","","","","","","","27-29 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Netflow statistics is mainly used to allocate the weights for traffic routing by routers.

However, less success has been encountered in mapping data intensive irregular applications such as graph analytics, relational databases, and machine learning. Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks. Experiments with a set of irregular data intensive CUDA applications executing on a cycle-level simulator show that DTBL achieves average 1.21x speedup over the original flat implementation and average 1.40x over the implementation with device-side kernel launches using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism.","","","","10.1145/2749469.2750393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284092","","Cognition;Context;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Organizations;Registers","graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming","1D-3D grid;BSP programming languages;CUDA dynamic parallelism;DTBL;GPU execution model;bulk synchronous parallel programming languages;cycle-level simulator;data intensive irregular applications;dynamic thread block launch;irregular data intensive CUDA applications;lightweight execution mechanism;lightweight thread block dynamic spawning;nested device-side kernel launching functionality","","","","","","","13-17 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since soldiers are considered as nodes in a cooperative network, each node is integrated with wearable sensor nodes in their body. The wearable sensor devices are well configured should cooperate to each other within the region and also with the Base station. If any node moves in wrong direction, communicate with other unknown nodes, dropping wrong information or communicate with wrong messages those nodes are detected as malicious nodes and eliminated from the network by monitoring wearable sensors.

The features of packet flows (such as the minimal packet inter-arrival time and the number of packets with non-zero options in TCP headers) are used frequently in determining the traffic type and applying security policies. However, the extraction of flow features is difficult due to the increasing line rates, a broad range of network protocols, and a variety of complex flow features. In this paper, we leverage the multi-core processors to speed up the feature extraction process. We design an open source parallel software tool, aiming for processing network packet flows in real-time. We implement the software in four different designs including serial, parallel, pipelined and hybrid architectures. We evaluate the performance of the parallel software tool through measurement experiments. Our experimental results show that each method increases the packet processing throughput by 5-7% in comparison with the previous method. And finally the implementation based on the hybrid architecture improves the packet processing performance by 19.3% than the implementation based on the serial architecture.","","978-1-4244-8133-0","","10.1109/NAS.2010.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575656","Flow feature extraction;multi-core processors;parallelism","Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Machine learning algorithms;Multicore processing;Payloads;Throughput","computer network security;feature extraction;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;parallel processing;parallel programming;performance evaluation;software tools;telecommunication traffic","high performance flow feature extraction;hybrid architecture;multicore processors;network applications;network protocols;network traffic;open source parallel software tool;packet flows;packet processing;performance evaluation;security policies;serial architecture","","6","","27","","","15-17 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
