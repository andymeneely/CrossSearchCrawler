It applies an improved hierarchy clustering tree to organize clusters which are obtained by density-based partitioning method. We extend the clustering algorithm and apply branch and bound method for filtering noise. With the help of two advantages: filtering noise and updating normality profiles at any time, our algorithm is suitable for the changing and complex network.

According to the limitation of SK-SVM, in this paper we present an intrusion detection method based on multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM). MK-SVM can calculate the weights of kernel functions and Lagrange multipliers simultaneously through semi-infinite linear programming, and thus achieve the choice of kernel functions and the optimization of classifier. Furthermore, in order to reduce the time and space required of this method, we adopt feature selection and clustering method in the process of input data preprocessing.

"Classification of Disturbances and Cyber-Attacks in Power Systems Using Heterogeneous Time-Synchronized Data","Shengyi Pan; Morris, T.; Adhikari, U.","Mississippi State Univ., Starkville, MS, USA","Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on","20150602","2015","11","3","650","662","Visualization and situational awareness are of vital importance for power systems, as the earlier a power-system event such as a transmission line fault or cyber-attack is identified, the quicker operators can react to avoid unnecessary loss. Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","0","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SMARTDIAB consists mainly of two units: 1) the patient unit (PU); and 2) the patient management unit (PMU), which communicate with each other for data exchange. The PMU can be accessed by the PU through the internet using devices, such as PCs/laptops with direct internet access or mobile phones via a Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service access network. The PU consists of an insulin pump for subcutaneous insulin infusion to the patient and a continuous glucose measurement system. The aforementioned devices running a user-friendly application gather patient's related information and transmit it to the PMU. The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment. The IIAS is used to close the loop between the insulin pump and the continuous glucose monitoring system, by providing the pump with the appropriate insulin infusion rate in order to keep the patient's glucose levels within predefined limits.

But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naïve bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced.

Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","86","7","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The antiquated nature of some of the most widely used datasets along with their inadequacies is examined and used as a basis for discussion of a new approach to analyzing network traffic data. Live network traffic is collected that consists of real normal traffic and both real and penetration testing attack data. Attack data is then inspected and labeled by means of manual analysis. While network attacks and anomaly features vary widely, they share some commonalities that are examined here. Among these are: self-similarity convergence, periodicity, and repetition. Further, the knowledge inherent in the definition of network boundaries and advertised services can provide crucial context that allows the network analyst to consider self-aware attributes when examining network traffic sessions. To these ends the Session Aggregation for Network Traffic Analysis (SANTA) dataset is proposed.

In a distributed Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), collaboration and cooperation is critical concern to managing trust. The networks work well only if the mobile nodes are trusty and behave cooperatively. Due to the openness in network topology and absence of a centralized administration in management, MANETs are very vulnerable to various attacks from malicious nodes. In order to reduce the hazards from such nodes and enhance the security of network, trust-based model is used to evaluate the trustworthiness of nodes. Trust-based approach provides a flexible and feasible approach to choose the shortest route that meets the security requirement of data packets transmission.

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system. The paper presents the Evasion technique for customized apriori algorithm. The paper aims to make a new functional structure to evade NIDS. This framework can be used to audit NIDS.

An organization should find the methods to protect their data and network system to reduce the risk from attacks. Snort Intrusion Detection System (Snort-IDS) is a security tool of network security. It has been widely used for protecting the network of the organizations. The Snort-IDS utilize the rules to matching data packets traffic. If some packet matches the rules, Snort-IDS will generate the alert messages. However, Snort-IDS contain many rules and it also generates a lot of false alerts. In this paper, we present the procedure to improve the Snort-IDS rules for the network probe attack detection. In order to test the performance evaluation, we utilized the data set from the MIT-DAPRA 1999, which includes the normal and abnormal traffics. Firstly, we analyzed and explored the existing the Snort-IDS rules to improve the proposed Snort-IDS rules. Secondly, we applied the WireShark software to analyze data packets form of attack in data set. Finally, the Snort-IDS was improved, and it can detect the network probe attack. This paper, we had classified the attacks into several groups based on the nature of network probe attack. In addition, we also compared the efficacy of detection attacks between Snort-IDS rules to be updated with the Detection Scoring Truth. As the experimental results, the proposed Snort-IDS efficiently detected the network probe attacks compared to the Detection Scoring Truth. It can achieve higher accuracy. However, there were some detecting alert that occur over the attack in Detection Scoring Truth, because some attack occur in several time but the Detection Scoring Truth indentify as one time.","","","","10.1109/ICoICT.2014.6914042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914042","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Network Security;Network probe attack;Snort-IDS rule","Communication networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers);Probes;Protocols","computer network security;data analysis","MIT-DAPRA;Snort intrusion detection system;Snort-IDS;WireShark software;abnormal traffics;alert messages;data packet analysis;data packet traffic matching;detection scoring truth;false alerts;network probe attack detection;network protection;network system security;normal traffics;performance evaluation","","0","","18","","","28-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","0196-2892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine","","91","1","46","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, packet analysis systems examine network traffic to detect active botnets and spreading worms. However, with the advent of multi-gigabit link speeds, capturing and analysing header and payload of every packet requires enormous amounts of computational resources and is therefore not feasible in many situations. We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets. Thus, our sampling algorithm can be deployed in front of a detection system to reduce the amount of inspected packets without degrading the detection results significantly.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-5366-5","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488473","","Filters;Forensics;High-speed networks;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Out of order;Payloads;Runtime;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;sampling methods","Bloom filters;TCP connections;botnet detection;malware;network security;packet sampling;sampling algorithm;worm detection","","5","","25","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bluetooth, WiFi, and cellular technologies interconnect mobile devices with other computing devices and represent vectors into the device that may be exploited by malicious persons. A malicious person can theoretically take complete control of a mobile device via wireless and use it for all kinds of illicit purposes. While some malicious codes have been reported in the literature for these devices, it is only a matter of time before these codes become as common on mobile devices as they are on desktop computers. Most people have had an experience with a virus on their desktop PC, but have not had the same experience on their smart phone. This will change.

However, major content providers are reluctant to use this technology because no solution to ensure the distribution of only legal contents is provided. In the same way, network operators do not really push towards P2P content distribution because bad organization of the overlay can lead to overload the network and consume a lot of networks resources. In this paper, a secure and legal network-aware P2P video system is introduced, which aims at overcoming those two drawbacks. The design of the system and the evaluation of a prototype showed good results and let us be optimistic about a possible deployment of P2P systems for video delivery, having the support of content providers as well as network operators.","","978-1-4244-6728-0","","10.1109/ICIW.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476763","P2P Video Streaming;legal contents;network-awareness;secure distribution;watermarking","Computer architecture;Design optimization;IP networks;Law;Legal factors;Peer to peer computing;Prototypes;Video sharing;Watermarking;Web and internet services","computer network security;content management;peer-to-peer computing;video on demand;video streaming","P2P VoD system;P2P video system;content distribution;file sharing;network operator;peer-to-peer network;video delivery","","1","","20","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their perceived success has led to the development of similar approaches in cyber security; information about previous attacks can be used to identify wider vulnerabilities and to inform future threat assessments. However, it can be difficult to integrate safety and security reporting within a single system. For example, in safety reporting systems the aim is often to disseminate lessons as widely as possible. In cyber security, there is a concern that this might motivate and inform further attacks. This paper identifies the challenges that arise in developing reporting schemes for security incidents in safety-critical applications. In particular we focus on the problems of implementing intrusion detection systems and coordinating forensic analysis without undermining system safety. These problems are exacerbated because existing cyber-security reporting guidelines focus more on office based systems than complex, command and control applications.","","978-1-84919-940-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111733","Cyber-Security;Forensics;Incident Reporting;Intrusion Detection Systems;Safety-Critical Systems","","digital forensics;safety-critical software","Cyber attack;Cyber-security incidents;coordinating forensic analysis;information vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;office based systems;reporting scheme;safety management systems;safety-critical systems;security incidents;threat assessment","","0","","","","","15-16 Oct. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well. On the other hand, many other common architecture and system optimizations have only a negligible impact on throughput.","","0-7803-9461-5","","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526016","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control;Workstations","computer networks;performance evaluation;public domain software;security of data;telecommunication security","full-system simulation;interrupt aggregation;modern workstation architecture;open source network intrusion detection systems;packet loss minimization;rule set pruning;system-level optimization","","2","","22","","","6-8 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.","","","","10.1109/MOBS.2013.6614222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614222","Information security;Mobile Networks;Moving Target Defense","Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Servers","computer network security;mobile computing;radio networks","attack avoidance;attack detection;cloud services;critical nodes;heterogeneous moving target networks;mobile applications;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile node instability;mobile-enabled systems;network communication characteristics;network-layer moving target defense;peer registration servers;static node security;static nodes","","0","","11","","","25-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Preventive approaches can be applied to protect WSNs from some kinds of attacks. However, preventive methods are not efficient on specific attacks. So it is necessary to develop some mechanisms for intrusion detection. Intrusion detection system (IDS) not only prevents adversaries from attacking the network, but also provides attackspsila features for improving the preventive algorithms.

The approach is suitable for small and fast hardware implementation and was designed to be embedded in network appliances. Each network packet is characterized using a novel technique that efficiently maps the payload histogram onto a simple pair of features using hypercube hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components. Results using the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Set yield a 100% detection of all applicable attacks, with extremely low false positive rate. The approach is also evaluated on real traffic captures.","","978-1-4244-2412-2","978-1-4244-2413-9","10.1109/LCN.2008.4664303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664303","Anomaly Detection;Network Intrusion Detection","Costs;Counting circuits;Hardware;High-speed networks;Histograms;Hypercubes;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;cryptography;telecommunication security","2D feature space;high-speed network intrusion prevention;hypercube hash function;lightweight stateless payload inspection;network-based attack;packet-level anomaly detection","","3","","28","","","14-17 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an accurate signature generation system for zero-day polymorphic worms. We have designed a novel Double-honeynet system, which is able to detect zero-day polymorphic worms that have not been seen before. To generate signatures for polymorphic worms we have two steps. The first step is the polymorphic worms sample collection which is done by the Double-honeynet system. The second step is the signature generation for the collected samples which is done by k-means clustering algorithm and a Multilayer Perceptron Model. The system collects different types of polymorphic worms, we used the k-means clustering algorithm to separate each type into a cluster. The Multilayer Perceptron Model is used to generate signatures for each cluster.

However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","","","","1","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a ""single point of failure "". We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge.

In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.","","978-1-4673-6320-4","","10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581","","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training","Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection","Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction","","0","","20","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through theoretical analysis, the stability conditions are obtained mathematically. Numerical results from the experiment are in favor of the theoretical analysis.

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To facilitate human analysts to gain a better understanding of anomalous network traffic patterns, we present a visualization tool that supports multiple user-customizable views and animation for analyzing network packet traces.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3450-3","","10.1109/HICSS.2009.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755529","","Communication system traffic control;Computer security;Humans;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Nonhomogeneous media;Pattern analysis;Process control;Protection;Protocols","data visualisation;process control;production engineering computing;security of data","anomalous network traffic;hardening fixing;human analysts;intrusion detection;intrusion monitoring;multilayer security architecture;multiple user-customizable views;network traffic patterns;preventive security measures;process control systems;situational awareness;system hardening;visualization tool","","2","","13","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rapid and infrastructure-less deployment in emergency and military situations make these networks unique. However, certain inherently vulnerable characteristics lead to security concerns, which can prove especially damaging in sensitive situations like military operations. Intrusion prevention measures are not guaranteed to work all the time since unrelenting attackers can eventually break them down. An intrusion detection scheme (IDS) monitors a network and looks for intrusions, thus forming a second wall of defense. In this paper, we have proposed a misuse detection -based IDS for MANETs. Our protocol-independent design makes use of a self-adjusting threshold scheme and detects a priori known attack patterns with over 90% accuracy and is generally insensitive to false alarms. Experimental validation has provided significant results about non-degradability of network performance with our IDS incorporated for security enhancements.","","0-7803-7906-3","","10.1109/IECON.2003.1280229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1280229","","Broadcasting;Communication system security;Computer science;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Time measurement;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication security","MANET;attack patterns;denial of service attacks;destination-sequenced distance-vector protocol;intrusion detection scheme;replay attack;self-adjusting threshold scheme;wireless mobile ad hoc networks","","2","","7","","","2-6 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many solutions were proposed to resolve this problem: Generally, the common practice for dealing with imbalanced data sets is to rebalance them artificially by using sampling methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier. To reduce the computational cost of selecting samples, we propose a clustering method as a first step in order to determine the critical centers, and then we select samples from those critical clusters.

Any attacker in the vicinity can easily get onto the internal network through a rogue AP, bypassing all perimeter security measures. Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.","","978-1-4244-1432-1","978-1-4244-1433-8","10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468","","Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN","","","","9","","16","","","10-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","1","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This report tackles this concern for enterprises in terms of security with intrusion detection while adopting cloud computing. The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network.

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.","","978-1-4244-3337-7","978-1-4244-3338-4","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190","","Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management","probability;radiofrequency identification","RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain","","7","5","23","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
