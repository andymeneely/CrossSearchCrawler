It protects virtual and physical computer networks against threats and vulnerabilities. Presently, machine learning techniques are widely extended to implement effective intrusion detection system. Neural network, statistical models, rule learning, and ensemble methods are some of the kinds of machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model. The proposed ensemble method provides competitively low false positives compared with other machine learning techniques.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155853","Bagging;Ensemble;False positives;Machine learning;REPTree;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Bagging;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","NSL-KDD dataset;REPTree;classification accuracy;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;neural network;physical computer networks;statistical models;using bagging ensemble method;virtual computer networks","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current techniques support the search for multiple patterns using deterministic or non-deterministic automata. In practice however, the static pattern representation does not fully utilize available system resources, subsequently suffering from poor performance. Therefore a low overhead auto-reconfigurable automaton is needed that optimizes pattern matching performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time. Morpheus uses templates to speed up dynamic automaton reconfiguration. Results from empirical studies confirm the benefits of our approach, with three orders of magnitude improvement achieved in the overall pattern matching performance with the help of dynamic reconfiguration. This is accomplished only with a modest increase in amortized memory usage.","1063-6382","978-1-4673-0042-1","","10.1109/ICDE.2012.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228144","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Dynamic scheduling;Engines;Equations;Optimization;Pattern matching","data structures;deterministic automata;pattern matching;query processing","autoreconfigurable automaton;data stream;database searching;deterministic automata;dynamic automaton reconfiguration;dynamic configuration morphing;massive pattern query optimization;nondeterministic automata;pattern matching;query pattern representation;resource constrained system;static pattern representation","","1","","29","","","1-5 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach monitors accesses to objects on disk and follows the causal chain of these accesses across processes, even after the objects are copied into memory. Our forensic layer records these transactions in a tamper evident version-based audit log that allows for faithful, and efficient, reconstruction of the recorded events and the changes they induced. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation, including a real-world case study demonstrating how our platform can be used to reconstruct valuable information about the what, when, and how, after a compromise has been detected.

But these methods are not effective to deal with the network attack and destruction, due to these attacks and destructions are various, random, covert and sometimes epidemic. The international research shows that network security is on the way to trustworthy network. Apart from current security mechanism, the future trustworthy network adds network behaviour trust and user behaviour trust, so user behaviour prediction is important and significant for realization of the trustworthy network.

MANETs commonly demand a robust, diverse, energy-efficient, and resilient communication and computing infrastructure, enabling network-centric operation with minimal downtime. MANETs face security risks and energy consumption. However, conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a MANET becomes a challenging issue because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address this issue, we develop both lossless and lossy aggregation techniques to reduce the energy cost in information transition and bandwidth consumption while preserving the desired detection accuracy. In particular, we develop two lossless aggregation techniques: compression-based and event-based aggregation and develop a lossy aggregation technique: feature-based aggregation. We conduct real-world experiments and simulation study to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed data aggregation techniques in terms of the energy consumption and detection accuracy.","","978-1-4673-3131-9","","10.1109/CCNC.2013.6488430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488430","","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring","data compression;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","MANET;bandwidth consumption;compression-based aggregation;computing infrastructure;cyber attack monitoring;data aggregation techniques;energy consumption;energy cost;energy-efficiency;event-based aggregation;feature-based aggregation;host-based intrusion detection;lossless aggregation techniques;lossy aggregation techniques;mobile ad hoc networks;network-centric operation;security risks","","1","","11","","","11-14 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the problem has received some attention from the research community, little is known about the tradeoffs among different objectives, e.g. network performance, power consumption, delay in information being collected and security effectiveness. This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate that our solution is characterized by: a small variance in the normalized fitness values of individual/single objectives; and a smaller attack detection and reporting delay than state of art solutions. In a real implementation/evaluation of our cooperative intrusion detection system, we demonstrate that it achieves a higher detection rate (93%) than state of art solutions (60%-73%).","1095-2055","978-1-4577-0637-0","","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6006035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006035","","Biological cells;Delay;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Optimization;Power demand","cooperative communication;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless sensor networks","cooperative IDS;cooperative intrusion detection functions;optimal monitoring;resource constrained wireless networks","","0","","15","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the rapid increase of link speeds and throughputs - especially in larger networks such as backbone networks - seriously constrains this approach. First, devices capable of detecting intrusions on high-speed links of 10 Gbps and higher are rather expensive, or must be built based on complex arrays. Second, legislation commonly restricts the way in which backbone network operators can analyse the data in their networks. To overcome these constraints, flow-based intrusion detection can be applied, which traditionally focuses only on packet header fields and packet characteristics. Flow export technologies are nowadays embedded in most high-end packet forwarding devices and are widely used for network management, which makes this approach economically attractive.","2325-5366","978-9949-9544-0-7","","10.1109/CYCON.2014.6916403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916403","Flow-Based Intrusion Detection;High-speed Networks;Intrusion Detection;Legal Inspection;Network Security","High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Standards;Taxonomy","computer network management;computer network security","DPI;backbone networks;deep packet inspection;flow-based intrusion detection;high-speed networks;network management;packet forwarding devices","","0","","30","","","3-6 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Intrusion detection datasets are generally very large and contain many noncontributing features and redundant data. These drawbacks lead to inaccurate intrusion detection and increased computational cost when machine learning techniques are evaluated. Several data cleaning techniques have been proposed to eliminate redundant records and noncontributing features. These techniques reduce the size of the datasets significantly and make the characteristics of the data closer to the characteristics of intrusions in a real network. This paper identifies anomaly problems in normal and intrusion attacks data, and proposes an ellipsoid-based technique to detect anomalies and clean the intrusion detection datasets further.

A generic Grid-IDS architecture is presented as well as a concrete realization based on various Web services specifications. At the heart of the introduced Grid-IDS architecture is the correlation service, which receives the event information from sensors distributed across the federation and detects intrusions by analyzing and correlating the events. A protocol-aware correlation service is proposed, in which each service protocol is abstracted to a generic representation - a relationship of roles. Finally, based on the developed Grid-IDS and the gathered experiences, an approach towards intrusion tolerance is presented and discussed.","","978-1-4244-0974-7","978-1-4244-0975-4","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550328","Grid;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Tolerance;SOA","Access protocols;Authentication;Authorization;Banking;Europe;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National electric code;Service oriented architecture","","","","0","","36","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We adopt Random Forest (RF) for feature selection and Minimax Probability Machine (MPM) for intrusion detection. RF provides the variable importance by numeric values so that the irrelevant features can be eliminated. However, the NIDS based on RF is slow to build intrusion detection model. We employ MPM, since MPM has been shown a better performance, compared with RF in terms of model building time. To validate the feasibility, we carry out several times of experiments with KDD 1999 intrusion detection dataset. The experimental results show the proposed approach is faster and more lightweight than the previous approaches while guaranteeing high detection rates so that it is suitable for real-time NIDS.","","0-7695-3072-9","978-0-7695-3072-7","10.1109/CIS.2007.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4415437","","Computer networks;Data security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Minimax techniques;Radio frequency;Real time systems;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Throughput","","","","0","","6","","","15-19 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Syst., Univ. of North Carolina, Charlotte, NC, USA","Communications and Network Security (CNS), 2014 IEEE Conference on","20141229","2014","","","292","300","Legacy energy infrastructures are being replaced by modern smart grids. Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios. Second tier successfully verified all the injected intrusions.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997497","","Automatic generation control;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Smart grids","power engineering computing;power system control;security of data;smart power grids","ACE;AGC;Markov models;area control error;automatic generation control;data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system;legacy energy infrastructures;short-term adaptive predictor;smart grid","","0","","20","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional intrusion detection systems look for unusual or suspicious activity, such as patterns of network traffic that are likely indicators of unauthorized activity. However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely ""attack signature"", resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to implement a feature selection, and support vector machine (SVMs) with the one-versus-rest method serve as a fitness function of PSO for classification problems from the literature. Experimental result shows that our method allows us to recognize not only known attacks but also to detect suspicious activity that may be the result of a new, unknown attack.

Proceedings. 19th IEEE International","20050418","2005","","","8 pp.","","Sandboxing systems are extremely useful for secure execution of untrusted applications. Many of the sandboxing systems proposed so far provide security by intercepting system calls invoked by an application and controlling their execution. However, a problem in existing sandboxing systems is the amount of overhead required for security checks performed after system call interceptions. In this paper, we propose a sandboxing system that executes speculative security checks. The proposed system predicts the behavior of a sandboxed application and executes speculative security checks in parallel with the application, thus reducing the overhead. Behavior is predicted based on system call profiles in past executions of the application.

Sensor nodes placed in remote areas require less attention and supervision, but require significant battery power to survive long periods of time. Recharging or replacing batteries are difficult since units are often placed in areas which are difficult to access. Hence this technology requires sensor nodes to be as autonomic as possible where the nodes should be able to manage themselves without human intervention. We proposed a new mobile agent based energy efficient, self-healing framework for a sensor network. The proposed framework will be implemented in a real world prototype specifically providing detection of illegal entry to designated areas.

In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks. The simulation results show that even when the channel error rate is 15%, simulating very harsh radio conditions, the detection accuracy of the proposed scheme is over 95%.","","1-4244-0054-6","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639675","","Application software;Base stations;Computer science;Error analysis;Fires;Intelligent networks;Military computing;Routing protocols;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","mission-critical application;multihop acknowledgement;security scheme;selective forwarding attacks detection;sensitive packet;wireless sensor network","","24","1","20","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, research on security metrics has been hindered by difficulties in handling zero-day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities has been considered as something unmeasurable due to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because a more secure configuration would be of little value if it were equally susceptible to zero-day attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting to rank unknown vulnerabilities, our metric counts how many such vulnerabilities would be required for compromising network assets; a larger count implies more security because the likelihood of having more unknown vulnerabilities available, applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will be significantly lower. We formally define the metric, analyze the complexity of computing the metric, devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and finally demonstrate through case studies that applying the metric to existing network security practices may generate actionable knowledge.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529081","Security metrics;attack graph;network hardening;network security","","computer network security","computational complexity;heuristic algorithms;k zero day safety;network security metric;software flaws","","2","","43","","2013-06-11","Jan.-Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proliferation of smart devices has led to an emergence of various services such as messengers, SNS and smart banking, and brought convenience in using the services. However, the threat called security vulnerabilities is being faced on the other side. The damages suffered from such a threat are personal information leakage, unreasonable charging, root permission acquisition and so on. In addition, it is said that Android, which is considered as the most vulnerable operating system among the smart devices' operating systems, has the greatest damage of malware codes. Accordingly, this paper proposes a technique to detect malicious codes based on Android devices by using the multivariate time-series analysis.

In this work, we design an IDN system, called GUIDEX, using game-theoretic modeling and trust management for peers to collaborate truthfully and actively. We first describe the system architecture and its individual components, and then establish a game-theoretic framework for the resource management component of GUIDEX. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in a reciprocal incentive compatible manner. Based on the duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium. Our numerical experiments and discrete event simulation demonstrate the convergence to the Nash equilibrium and the security features of GUIDEX against free riders, dishonest insiders and DoS attacks.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2012.121214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354280","Intrusion detection systems;collaborative networks;game theory;incentive compatibility;network optimization;network security and economics","Communication networks;Computer crime;Computer security;Economics;Intrusion detection;Security;Telecommunication services","Internet;computer network security;game theory","DoS attacks;GUIDEX IDN system;IDS peers;Nash equilibrium;collaborative IDS network;detection knowledge;discrete event simulation;dishonest insiders;free riders;game-theoretic incentive-based mechanism;game-theoretic modeling;intrusion assessment;intrusion detection networks;intrusion detection systems;iterative algorithm;resource management component;security features;trust management","","3","","33","","","December 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This classification allows for fewer packets to be sent to an IDS devoted to examining un-trusted traffic. The logic of the splitter looks at each packet as part of a connection and give it a trust ranking from [0..1] using a fuzzy logic model.

Different from the general server, once the cloud environment suffered from malicious attacks, people or companies will get caught in extreme dangers. Therefore, it is important for network security in cloud. Since there are a lot of packets in network traffic including malicious packets, huge amounts of alerts will be generated by the intrusion detection system. Analyzing these alert data is time-consuming and it is difficult to obtain the attack steps and strategies immediately by directly performing these analyses. We proposed an adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system that employs a Bayesian Network to choose the features with high relevance and then adjusts the feature weights according to the statistics of Bayesian Network in a period of time. We estimate the correlation probability of two alerts with the relevant features by using the Feature Wight Matrix, and the correlation probability is recorded in Alert Correlation Matrix. Using the information in Alert Correlation Matrix, we can extract high level attack strategies and construct attack graphs. In our system, facing a great deal of network traffic, the administrator can accurately recognize intruders' intentions and learn about the attack probabilities and network security situations.","","","","10.1109/ASIAJCIS.2013.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6621650","Bayesian network;Feature Wight Matrix;alert correlation;cloud environment;intrusion detection system","Bayes methods;Correlation;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection","Bayes methods;belief networks;cloud computing;data analysis;matrix algebra;probability;security of data","Bayesian network;adaptive feature-weighted alert correlation system;alert correlation matrix;alert correlation probability;alert data analysis;attack graphs;attack probability;attack techniques;cloud environment;feature weight matrix;high level attack strategy;intrusion detection system;malicious attacks;malicious packets;network security;network traffic","","0","","7","","","25-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a scalable and parameter-free unsupervised AD technique, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm has attracted a lot of attention for its applications in computer networks and WSNs. However, the nature of lazy-learning makes the kNN-based AD schemes difficult to be used in an online manner, especially when communication cost is constrained. In this paper, a new kNN-based AD scheme based on hypergrid intuition is proposed for WSN applications to overcome the lazy-learning problem. Through redefining anomaly from a hypersphere detection region (DR) to a hypercube DR, the computational complexity is reduced significantly. At the same time, an attached coefficient is used to convert a hypergrid structure into a positive coordinate space in order to retain the redundancy for online update and tailor for bit operation. In addition, distributed computing is taken into account, and position of the hypercube is encoded by a few bits only using the bit operation. As a result, the new scheme is able to work successfully in any environment without human interventions. Finally, the experiments with a real WSN data set demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and robust.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295612","Complexity theory;Detectors;Encoding;Monitoring;Real time systems;Training data;Wireless sensor network;Wireless sensor networks;anomaly detection;distributed computing;k-nearest neighbor;parameter selection","Complexity theory;Detectors;Encoding;Monitoring;Real time systems;Training data;Wireless sensor networks","computational complexity;hypercube networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","WSN;communication cost;computational complexity;computer network;cyberattack protection;distributed computing;hypercube DR;hypersphere detection region;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;lazy-learning problem;parameter-free unsupervised AD technique;positive coordinate space;random fault protection;scalable hypergrid k-NN-based online anomaly detection;wireless sensor network","","8","","30","","2012-09-05","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability. Our experiments show that COPY precisely identifies every packet in a labeled trace. When comparing with other six approaches on the real traces, COPY performs 4.2Gb/s and 24.7Gb/s with single- and eight-thread models, respectively, which improves 20%-860% than others, and consumes acceptable offline overhead in time and space.","","","","10.1109/ANCS.2015.7110120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7110120","","Accuracy;Automata;Grammar;Payloads;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Semantics","automata theory;context-free grammars;program compilers;programming language semantics;protocols;software defined networking","COPY;DCA;DCCFG;SDN;application layer protocols;commodity hardware;content parsing;distinguishable counting automaton;distinguishable counting context free grammar;protocol semantics;software defined networking","","0","","38","","","7-8 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thanks to the advances in smart phones and Near Field Communication (NFC) technologies, e-invoices can be delivered via NFC-enabled smartpones, allowing consumers to examine the content immediately after transactions and to easily retrieve them later on.

The design of a secure computer communications architecture to protect the integrity of information exchange is pursued by the aerospace industry, the commercial and financial sectors, and at all levels of government agencies. Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture. Intrusion detection techniques include signature identification of the intruder to locate and respond to network and host-based intruder attacks. Some of these same techniques will uncover the forensic evidence and explain how the computer or network system was compromised. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are another example of a security ap- - pliance. This network device employs security mechanisms such as tunneling, Internet protocol (IP) security protocols and cryptography. Insecure computer communications can have devastating consequences on national security, which would affect every aspect of daily life.

First, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is used to trim the original dataset, and a feature selection method, called GATS, which is based upon Genetic Algorithm (GA) embedded tabu search (TS), is used to extract the optimal subset from the reduced dataset. GATS integrates the concept of tabu list which may increase local search performance. Then, an incremental SVM with reserved set method (R-ISVM) is developed to deal with the problem of intrusion detection. Thirdly, according to the variations of classification hyperplane in incremental training, R-ISVM utilizes a concentric-circle model based reserved set strategy to maintain the samples that are most likely to be support vectors in future computation. Data experiments and comparisons with other popular intrusion detection approaches show that our presented method achieves better performance as well as stability.","","","978-1-84919-729-8","10.1049/cp.2013.2450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6825999","Feature Selection;Incrementally Learning;Network Intrusion Detection;Support Vector Machine","","genetic algorithms;search problems;security of data;support vector machines","DBSCAN;GATS;R-ISVM;SVM classification;classification hyperplane;concentric-circle model;density-based spatial clustering of application with noise;genetic algorithm;hybrid feature selection;incremental support vector machine;local search;network intrusion detection;network security;reserved set method;tabu search","","0","","","","","22-24 Nov. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Therefore the system checks the identity of the user by their behaviour pattern using keystrokes dynamics to authenticate user. A number of samples of login and password attempts of each user is gathered and stored in a database. From the samples collected, keystroke patterns are derived called feature sets and signatures are formed for each user using Fuzzy Logic algorithms. Once signatures are formed, users are authenticated by comparing their typing pattern to the respective signatures formed.

In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms.

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and Web server mechanisms to put them in a Web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements.

Two exact algorithms are proposed whose time complexities are O(n<sup>k</sup>) and O(n<sup>k-1</sup>) respectively in the worst case, and a (1 - e<sup>-1</sup>)-approximate algorithm are designed. The simulation results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218385","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218385","","Approximation algorithms;Monitoring;Optimization;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","approximation theory;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks","WSN;composite event coverage problem;coverage quality;deployment costs;event monitoring;heterogeneous sensors deployment;time complexities;wireless sensor networks","","1","","","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses how answer set programming, a new logic programming paradigm, can be used to address, in a simple and elegant way, the problem of operating system discovery in computer networks by logically specifying the problem and providing solutions through automated reasoning. As a result of using such a knowledge representation framework, it is possible to unify the active and the passive methods to OS discovery in a single hybrid approach that has the advantages of both strategies while being much more versatile.

These features result in a slow training and testing process, heavy computational resources, and low detection accuracy. Features selection, therefore, is an important issue in EDSs. A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms can deliver satisfactory results in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and testing time.","","978-1-4244-2308-8","978-1-4244-2309-5","10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784780","","Bit error rate;Computer crime;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines","ESVDF;backward elimination ranking;classification accuracy;enhanced support vector decision function;features ranking;features selection;forward selection ranking;intrusion detection systems;support vector machines;testing time;training time","","6","","40","","","10-13 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The excessive discharge arises out of the limitation in battery capacity. Researches have been conducted to discover the cause of the abnormal usage of handset battery by employing power estimation techniques. It is also important, however, to automatically respond to the attack and maintain the power discharge at the normal level. In this study, we introduce a method designed to detect the defective process and to self-correct the abnormality by stopping or delaying the suspicious actions. The proposed system monitors system calls and the power usage of a local process, and delays activation of the abnormal system calls until the system calls can be run without hampering the battery life. The benefit of our proposed method lies in that it autonomously protects the expected battery lifespan during a battery exhaustion attack without shutting down operation of falsely detected programs.","0730-3157","978-0-7695-3726-9","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254050","battery exhaustion attack;system call delay","Application software;Batteries;Computer applications;Computer crime;Computer science;Delay;Design methodology;Mobile computing;Power system protection;Telephone sets","mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability","battery exhaustion attack;battery lifespan;denial-of-service attack;mobile system;power estimation technique;system call monitoring","","0","","10","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSN consists of numerous tiny wireless sensor nodes to communicate with each other with limited resources due to cost and size restrictions. Advancements in WSNs enable a wide range of environmental monitoring and object tracking applications. The major factor to be tackle in WSN the network lifetime and that actually depends on the efficiency of the routing protocol. A novel Biological Inspired Secure Autonomous Routing Protocol (BIOSARP) enhances Secure Real Time Load Distribution (SRTLD) with self-optimized routing mechanism that reduces neighbor discovery process at every hop. BIOSARP routing protocol depends on the optimal forwarding decision obtained by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. On top of ACO algorithm to provide preventive measures against abnormalities BIOSARP utilized artificial immune system (AIS). In this paper we present the energy efficiency and performance of ACO and AIS based hybrid nature adaptive computing method. Primarily, ACO based BIOSARP has been compared with SRTLD and onwards output of ACO algorithm and ACO+AIS algorithm is compared and analyzed in terms of delivery ratio, energy consumption and packet overhead. Network simulator 2 (NS2) has been utilized to perform the analysis.

These methods generally suffer from long training times, require parameter tuning, or do not perform well in multi-class classification. We propose a basic ELM method based on random features, and a kernel based ELM method for classification. We compare our methods with commonly used SVM techniques in both binary and multi-class classifications.
