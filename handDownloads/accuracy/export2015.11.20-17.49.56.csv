This proliferation, in combination with the interconnection of networks via the Internet, has drastically increased their vulnerability to attack by malicious agents. The wide variety of attack modes has exacerbated the problem in detecting attacks. Many current intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unable to identify unknown or mutated attack modes or are unable to operate in a dynamic environment as is necessary with mobile networks. As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods. Fuzzy-based systems accommodate the imprecision associated with mutated and previously unidentified attack modes. This paper presents an evolutionary-fuzzy approach to intrusion detection that is shown to provide superior performance in comparison to other evolutionary approaches. In addition, the method demonstrates improved robustness in comparison to other evolutionary-based techniques.","","978-1-4244-7859-0","978-1-4244-7857-6","10.1109/NAFIPS.2010.5548289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5548289","evolutionary computation;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithms;network intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Uncertainty","Internet;computer network security;evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory;optimisation","Internet;computer network;evolutionary based system;evolutionary optimization;fuzzy rule based network intrusion detection system;malicious agent;mobile network","","1","","18","","","12-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among other security threats network intrusion has been a major concern which requires considerable attention in order to protect the information resources that are accessible via network infrastructure. Though different intrusion detection approaches have been experimented but none of them can guarantee complete protection against network intrusions. Furthering research in this direction, we have been exploring the use of soft computing techniques to analyze intrusion data in order to detect intrusive behavior in network access patters. In this paper, we have carried out some experiments using techniques such as Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), back propagation, and J48 on the NSL-KDD intrusion data set in order to evaluate the performance of each of the techniques. We have also compared the performance of these techniques with respect to the detection and false alarm rates.","","978-0-7695-5066-4","","10.1109/ISCBI.2013.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724321","Intrusion detection;performance evaluation;soft computing techniques","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Principal component analysis;Radial basis function networks;Support vector machines;Training","backpropagation;computer network security;radial basis function networks;self-organising feature maps;support vector machines","J48;NSL-KDD intrusion data set;RBFN;SOM;SVM;back propagation;computer networks;false alarm rates;intrusion data;intrusion detection performance enhancement;intrusive behavior;network access patters;network based information management;network intrusion;radial basis function network;security concerns;self-organizing map;soft computing techniques;support vector machine","","0","","10","","","24-26 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Similarly, '⊗' quantifies information gain or loss as the change in the number of false alarms generated by a misuse detection system when feature-extracted data is used instead of original data. We present two neural network methods for feature extraction: (1) NNPCA and (2) NLCA for reducing the 41-dimensional KDD Cup 1999 data. We compare our methods with principal component analysis (PCA). Our results show that the NLCA method reduces the test data to approximately 30% of its original size while maintaining a GI comparable to that of PCA and the NNPCA method reduces the test data to approximately 50% with GI measure greater than that of PCA.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437817","","Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Feature extraction;Gain measurement;Intrusion detection;Loss measurement;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Real time systems;Testing","neural nets;pattern classification;real-time systems;security of data","dimension reduction;feature extraction;information gain;neural network;pattern classification;principal component analysis;real-time misuse detection system;sensitivity mismatch measure;specificity mismatch measure","","9","","24","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, the network data flows are divided into three data flows (TCP flow, UDP flow, and ICMP flow) according to network protocol and are sent to three detection agents. Then every detection agent constructs the detection model using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm based on the HVDM (Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric) distance.

Mathematical transformation algorithms have proven effective at interpreting multilingual, unstructured data, but high computational requirements of such algorithms prevent their widespread use. The rate of computation can be vastly increased with field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware. To experiment with this approach, we developed a system with FPGAs that ingests content over a network at high data rates. The system extracts basewords, counts words, scores documents, and discovers concepts on data that are carried in TCP/IP network flows as packets over a Gigabit Ethernet link or in cells transported over an OC48 link. These algorithms, as implemented in FPGA hardware, introduce certain constraints on the complexity and richness of the semantic processing algorithms. To understand the implications of these constraints and to benchmark the performance of the system, we have performed a series of experiments processing multilingual documents. In these experiments, we compare techniques to generate basewords for our semantic concepts, score documents, and discover concepts across a variety of processing operational scenarios","","0-7803-9545-X","","10.1109/AERO.2006.1656050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1656050","","Acceleration;Computational intelligence;Computational linguistics;Data mining;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;National security;Sorting;Testing;Text analysis","field programmable gate arrays;local area networks;natural languages;text analysis","FPGA hardware;Gigabit Ethernet link;OC48 link;TCP/IP network flows;baseword extraction;document scoring;document streams;field programmable gate array;hardware accelerated algorithms;multilingual document processing;multilingual unstructured data;semantic concepts;semantic processing;word counting","","7","5","19","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, it occupied a lower memory which could reduce the interference to normal user when administrators manage the network.","","978-1-4577-0369-0","","10.1109/ISCRAM.2011.6184094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184094","Network security;Response decision-making;Security analysis;Two-matrix game model","Fires;Games;Indexes;Markov processes","computer network management;computer network security;decision making;game theory;graph theory","Nash equilibrium point;attackers;defenders;dual-benefit matrix;game strategy graph;network management;optimal defense strategy decision-making algorithm;optimal network security response decision-making strategy;two-matrix network system security game model","","0","","20","","","25-27 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally. The results show that used in intrusion detection, the new algorithm has higher identification rate and it can increase network running efficiency and the success rate of training. Thereby it can reduce undetected rate and false alarm rate. Thus it proves the validity of the new algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4638-4","978-1-4244-4639-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5302607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302607","","Biological neural networks;Computer network management;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Helium;Information security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Transfer functions","genetic algorithms;neural nets;security of data","GA-based WWN intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;identification rate;network running efficiency;network security;wavelet neural network","","0","","13","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6449406","amazon web service;anti-botnet;anti-phishing;cloud computing;collaborative network security system;computer forensics;eucalyptus;hadoop file system;overlay network","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer crime;Computer security;Digital forensics;Forensics;Network security;Web and internet services","","","","4","","","","","Feb. 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

The task of traffic identification is a complex task due to the constantly changing Internet and an increase in encrypted data. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as port-based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications use random ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes an Optimized Hybrid Model (OHM) that makes use of a rule-based model (Apriori) along with a self-organizing map (SOM) model to tackle the problem of traffic classification without making use of the payload or ports. The proposed method also allows the generation of association rules for new unknown applications and further labeling by experts. Besides that, a optimizer called Firefly Algorithm was also used to enhance the results by optimizing both Apriori and SOM parameters and a comparative study was performed on both optimized and non-optimized models. The OHM showed to be superior to a non-optimized model for both eMule and Skype applications, reaching levels superior to 94% for correctness rate. The OHM was also validated against another model based on computational intelligence, named Realtime, and the OHM proposed in this work presented better results when tested in real time.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755057","Association Rules;Firefly Algorithm;Network Traffic Measurement;Self-Organizing Maps","Association rules;Computational modeling;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems;Training","Internet;computer network management;cryptography;data mining;evolutionary computation;pattern classification;self-organising feature maps","Apriori;DPI;Internet;OHM;Realtime computational intelligence;SOM;Skype;association rules;deep packet inspection;eMule;encrypted data;firefly algorithm;hybrid model;network traffic classification;network traffic identification;optimized hybrid model;port-based inspection;rule-based model;self-organizing map;traffic volume","","1","","24","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classic way to identify flows, e.g., examining the port numbers in the packet headers, becomes ineffective. In this context, deep packet inspection technology, which does not only inspect the packet headers but also the packet payloads, plays a more important role in traffic classification. Meanwhile regular expressions are replacing strings to represent patterns because of their expressive power, simplicity and flexibility. However, regular expressions mathcing technique causes a high memory usage and processing cost, which result in low throughout. In this paper, we analyze the application-level protocol distribution of network traffic and conclude its characteristic. Furthermore, we design a fast and memory-efficient system of a two-layer architecture for traffic classification with the help of regular expressions in multi-core architecture, which is different from previous one-layer architecture. In order to reduce the memory usage of DFA, we use a compression algorithm called CSCA to perform regular expressions matching, which can reduce 95% memory usage of DFA. We also introduce some optimizations to accelerate the matching speed.

In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort).

This work presents an adaptive classification framework for a realtime intrusion detection system that changes its behavior according to the patterns occurred in the new received data. The performance of the system is constantly monitored and whenever it drops under a certain level of accuracy, the classifier model is retrained to learn new patterns and eliminate the obsolete ones from its knowledge.

Specifically, assuming the system evolves as a Markov process conditioned upon the current system state, imperfect observation and action, a partially observable Markov decision process to model the efficacy of IDSs (as well as alert correlation technology) as providing a probabilistic assessment of the state of system assets, and to maximize rewards (cost and benefit) by taking appropriate actions in response to the estimated states.

Canadian Conference on","20030904","2003","2","","861","863 vol.2","Widespread attacks involving multiple hosts/networks happen more frequently as internetworking among computer systems via the Internet becomes more widely and keeps rapid increase. Due to lack of information, it can be quite difficult for conventional intrusion detection systems to identify such attacks in progress. Cooperative intrusion detection, on the basis of information sharing, is proved as a necessary measure to detect widespread attacks by other researcher D. Frincke (2000), Polla, D. et al., (1998). This paper presents a cooperative approach for intrusion detection that provides a method for individual ID components working cooperatively to perform concerted detections. Being constructed on the basis of ID components, CoIDS can adopt both existed (usually more mature) and new ID techniques. This makes CoIDS extensible and scalable.

Its reliability is also improved because failure of one ID component will not cause any other to stop working.

Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2050685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5499108","Class-association-rule mining;evolutionary computation;fuzzy membership function;intrusion detection","Data mining;Databases;Economic indicators;Fuzzy set theory;Genetic algorithms;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Tree graphs;Web and internet services","data mining;directed graphs;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;security of data","directed graph structures;fuzzy class-association-rule mining;fuzzy set theory;genetic network programming;intrusion-detection model","","20","","33","","2010-07-01","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A draw-back of SVM is that its performance results are influenced by its user input parameters. Therefore, in order to better the classifier we exploit the advantages of a recent Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithm, the Bat Algorithm (BA), which we improve by enhancing its randomization with Lévy flights.

A FCM for a dynamic system is a signed graph consisted of relevant concepts and causal relationships/weights between the concepts in the system. With suitable weights defined by experts in the related areas, the inference of the FCM can provide meaningful modeling of the system. Thus correctness of the weights is crucial to the success of a FCM system. Normally the weights are set by experts in the related areas. Considering the possible inefficiency and subjectivity of experts when judging the weights, it is an appealing idea to generate weights automatically according to the samples obtained through observation of the system. Some training algorithms were proposed. However, to our best knowledge, few learning algorithm has been reported to generate weight matrix based on sample sequences with continuous values. In this paper, we introduce a new learning algorithm to train the weights of FCM. In the proposed algorithm, the weights are updated by gradient descent on a squared Bellman residual, which is an accepted method in machine learning. The experiment results show that given sufficient training samples, the correct weights can be approximated by the algorithm.

AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection.

In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer. In this paper, we present measurement algorithms for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the main protocol for Web browsing.

Without that understanding, data publishers are left to wonder what fields must be anonymized to avoid legal fallout, while researchers question the confidence of results gained from the data. However, the extensive work done on micro- data anonymity provides the network research community with several useful insights about how to effectively apply anonymization to published data. At the same time, prior wisdom cannot be applied directly without first overcoming several challenges, including the development of appropriate privacy and utility definitions for the more complex case of network data.

The framework incorporates compressive sensing-based energy-efficient compression, and noisy wireless communication channel to study the effect on the application accuracy. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) and compressive sensing are used for EEG signals acquisition and compression. To obtain low-complexity energy-efficient, the best data accuracy with higher compression ratio is sought. A reconstructed algorithm derived from DCT of daubechie's wavelet 6 is used to decompose the EEG signal at different levels. DCT is combined with the best basis function neural networks for EEG signals classification. Extensive experimental work is conducted, utilizing four classification models. The obtained results show an improvement in classification accuracies and an optimal classification rate of about 95% is achieved when using NN classifier at 85% of CR in the case of no SNR value.

This anomaly based IDS focuses on the modeling of the application profile in the absence of attacks (called normal profile) using invariants. These invariants are discovered during a learning phase. Then, they are used to instrument the web application at source code level, so that a deviation from the normal profile can be detected at run-time. This paper illustrates on simple examples how the approach detects well known categories of web attacks that involve a state violation of the application, such as SQL injections.

In this paper, the excellent mechanisms of self-learning and adaptability in the human immune system are referred and a dynamic anomaly detection algorithm with immune positive selection, named as RAIM, is proposed. In RAIM, the concepts and formal definitions of antigen, antibody, and memory cells in the network security domain are given, the dynamic clonal principle of antibody is integrated, the mechanism of immune vaccination is discussed, and the dynamic evolvement formulations of detection profiles are established (including the detection profiles' dynamic generation and extinction, dynamic learning, dynamic transformation, and dynamic self-organization), which will accomplish that the detection profiles dynamically synchronize with the real network environment.

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.","","978-1-4799-3078-4","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318","Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security","computer network security","OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks","","0","","17","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture of the probe is based on a network acceleration card with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and a host computer. The configuration for FPGA chips is automatically generated by a configuration program according to the user's definition of the monitored values in order to save hardware resources and increase the throughput. The definition of the monitoring process is described using XML, transformed to VHDL and synthesized.

However, the remote sensing image data's usage rate still remains very low. To solve this problem, we propose a new Service model: Anytime-Anywhere Service (AAService) model, under which users can get remote sensing images anytime and anywhere. Then we implemented and tested our AA-Service System based on this Service model. First of all, we introduced the framework of the AA-Service System. The AAService System includes three units: Data Center, Communication Unit, and User Unit; and provides three kinds of Services: image Service, plotting Service, and update Service. The features of the AA-Service are seamless coverage, all online Service, and efficient distribution. Secondly, we also described the three key technologies of the AA-Service System in this paper: distributing data according to the users' needs, updating remote sensing image partially and transmitting data in an efficient way. In the AA-Service System, the remote sensing image is organized by the global subdivision compression pyramid which enables the System to distribute remote sensing images of different resolution to users according to the users' requests. When the remote sensing image is changing, the System only updates the changed area rather than the whole image. This is different from other image Service models which distribute remote sensing images by scene or map sheet. In addition, this System ensures reliable and efficient data transmission by integrating three communication methods: BeiDou communication, CDMA communication and Internet communication, and using a new packet loss retransmission mechanism. Thirdly, we listed the statistics data of the System test. In the System test, we measured the Qos and consumed time of image Service, plotting Service and update Service respectively. The results show that this AA-Service System can provide the remote sen- - sing images Service anytime and anywhere in a short time and in a good Qos. By using this AA-Service System, the remote sensing image data's usage rate will be increased and users can experience more convenient remote sensing images Service in their daily life.","","978-1-4244-7301-4","","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567681","AA-Service;Global Subdivision Compression Pyramid;Packet loss retransmission Mechanism;Partial-Image Updates;remote sensing images","Computational modeling;Data models;Databases;Image resolution;Internet;Receivers;Remote sensing","Internet;code division multiple access;data communication;geographic information systems;image processing;quality of service;remote sensing;statistical analysis","AA-Service system;AAService model;BeiDou communication;CDMA communication;Internet communication;QoS;all online service;anytime-anywhere-service system;communication unit;data center;data transmission;global subdivision compression pyramid;image service;packet loss retransmission mechanism;plotting service;remote sensing image data;remote sensing technology;seamless coverage;statistics data;update service;user unit","","0","","12","","","18-20 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cooperative sensing framework that can flexibly incorporate a variety of physical layer features to identify cases related to malicious behavior and genuine node failures. Though our approach is distributed, it is resilient in the sense that it does not simply rely on majority voting by a collection of nearby nodes. The key contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) A multiple criteria analysis technique and a non-parametric Bayesian inference method are formulated for identifying the spectrum holes that are least susceptible to malicious activity and failures, and (ii) Using real traces from the CRAWDAD data repository, we test our framework in a variety of practical settings, to prove the performance benefit of our approach.","2166-9570","","","10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6666573","","Cognitive radio;Noise;Principal component analysis;Probability;Resilience;Security;Sensors","Bayes methods;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication security","CRAWDAD data repository;catastrophic performance degradation;cognitive radio networks;denial of service;genuine node failures;intelligent jamming;multidimensional cooperative spectrum sensing technique;multiple criteria analysis technique;nonparametric Bayesian inference method;physical layer;primary user emulation;spectrum holes;spectrum usage efficiency","","0","","16","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first focus on a campus network by studying concrete scenarios of how credit-based network management can be applied.

We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection.

HMMs are applied to model the normal program behaviors using traces of system calls issued by processes. The output probability of a sequence of system calls is calculated by the normal model built. If the probability of a sequence in a trace is below a certain threshold, the sequence is flagged as a mismatch. If the ratio between the mismatches and all the sequences in a trace exceeds another threshold, the trace is then considered as a possible intrusion.

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated through emulations in Mininet.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838227","","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Control systems;IP networks;Measurement;Monitoring;Ports (Computers)","application program interfaces;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management","Floodlight;Mininet;OpenFlow standard;PayLess framework;RESTful API;SDN;adaptive statistics collection algorithm;aggregate statistics collection;application program interfaces;communication interfaces;control plane;data plane;flow control;flow level statistics collection mechanism;network management tasks;pull-based service;software defined networking;statistics collection mechanism","","14","","28","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, previous studies showed that the choice of network features used for the IDS is dependent on the type of the attack. Accordingly, each TCP/IP network layer has specific type of network attacks, which means that each TCP/IP network layer needs a specific type of IDS. This paper proposes a new categorization for IDS depending on the TCP/IP network model: application layer IDS (AIDS), transport layer IDS (TIDS), network layer IDS (NIDS) and link layer IDS (LIDS). Each of these IDS types is specialized to a specific network device. So, the detection process will be distributed among all TCP/IP network model layers through the network devices. To design each of these different types of IDS, several experiments have been conducted using two different features selection approaches to select the appropriate features set for each IDS type. The experimental results indicate that each IDS type has different features set that can not only improve the overall performance of the IDS, but it also can improve its scalability.","","978-1-4244-3999-7","978-0-7695-3639-2","10.1109/WAINA.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136630","Intrusion detection systems;TCP/IP network model;features ranking;features selection;support vector decision function;support vector machines","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data processing;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Support vector machines;TCPIP","security of data;transport protocols","TCP/IP network layer;application layer;information security;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network allocation;network devices;transport layer","","1","","24","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address localization attacks against ITM systems in which an attacker impairs the effectiveness of ITM systems by identifying the locations of ITM monitors. We propose an information-theoretic framework for the modeling of localization attacks as communication channels. Based on the information-theoretic model, we generalize all existing attacks as ldquotemporal attacksrdquo, derive closed formulae of their performance, and propose an effective detection approach.

Dimensionality reduction is a field in machine learning that consists on mapping high dimensional data into lower dimension while preserving important features of the original dataset. Dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to reduce the amount of data in applications such as speech signals, digital photographs, fMRI scans, DNA microarrays, Hyper spectral data. The purpose of this paper is to find the finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. This evaluation is necessary to improve the efficiency of NIDS in identifying existing attack patterns and recognizing new intrusion in real-time. Two dimensionality reduction techniques are used one linear technique (Principal Component Analysis) and one non-linear technique (Multidimensional Scaling). Data is then submitted to two classification algorithms J48 (C.45) and Naïve Bayes. This study was conducted using the KDD Cup 99 data. Experimental results show optimal performance with reduced datasets of 4 dimensions for J48 and 12 dimensions for Naïve Bayes.","Pending","978-1-4577-1538-9","","10.1109/ICDIM.2011.6093368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6093368","Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection;KDD;Multidimensional Scaling;Principal Component Analysis","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Covariance matrix;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis","Internet;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;telecommunication traffic","C.45;Internet traffic;J48;NIDS;classification algorithm;denial of service attack;dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;feature selection;machine learning;multidimensional scaling;naive Bayes method;network intrusion detection system;nonlinear technique;principal component analysis","","1","","32","","","26-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is critical to develop methods to study the interaction between the attacker and defender for finding the optimal allocation of the limited defense resources. In this study, the LR attack considering the attack and defense is modeled by bilevel optimization. Game-theoretic approaches are developed to model the interaction of the attacker and defender for two scenarios for defending critical measurements and for defending critical substations. The attack and defense interaction is modeled by a zero-sum game if only the load curtailment is considered in the utility functions. And it can be modeled by a non-zero-sum game if both the load curtailment and the associated attack cost and defense cost are considered. The proposed approach is tested based on a representative IEEE 14-bus system, and optimal defense strategies are derived in different scenarios. This study can offer some meaningful insight on effectively preventing and mitigating the LR attack.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2015.7286529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7286529","Cybersecurity;bilevel optimization;false data injection attack;game theory;non-zero-sum game","Game theory;Load modeling;MATLAB;Mathematical model","IEEE standards;game theory;load distribution;optimisation;power grids;power system control;power system protection","IEEE 14-bus system;LR attack;bilevel optimization;cyber monitoring;game theoretic approach;limited defense resource optimal allocation;load curtailment;load redistribution attack;optimal defense strategy;power grid;power system control layer;utility function","","","","","","","26-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naïve fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naïve fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably “Attack multipliers” and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network. An efficient detection scheme named Sentinel Protocol is proposed for detecting replica attack in MANET. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938709","Intrusion response;MANET;Mobile nodes;Replica attack;Sentinel Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;attack multipliers;enhanced intrusion detection system;intrusion response techniques;mobile ad hoc network;naïve fuzzy responses;network infrastructure;replica attack;routing attacks;sentinel protocol","","0","","13","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers. In this paper, we describe how the integrated architecture of NPU and TCAMs can be exploited to develop high-speed solutions for heavy distinct hitters.","1063-6927","0-7695-2837-3","0-7695-2837-3","10.1109/ICDCS.2007.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268163","","Associative memory;Central Processing Unit;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Data security;Hardware;Sampling methods;Stock markets","content-addressable storage;invasive software;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","associative memory;attack detection;data streams;distributed denial of service attack;heavy distinct hitter;network packet;network processing unit;network router;security attack;ternary content addressable memory;worm attack","","2","","18","","","25-27 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A selfish node does not directly intent to damage other nodes with active attacks but it simply does not cooperate in network operation, saving battery life for its own communication. The problem of identifying misbehaving nodes that drop packets selectively, in order to degrade the network performance is analysed. This paper we deal with misbehaving nodes in MANETs that drop packets supposed to be relayed, whose purpose may be either saving their resources or launching security attacks.

SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators. This paper proposes a tool which should lessen this burden and considerably reduce the workload of having to classify alerts by human beings.","1556-6463","978-1-4244-3805-1","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772652","False Alerts;IDS;JRip;Networks;Neuro-Fuzzy;Security","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Design engineering;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Protection","fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;security of data","JRip;NEFCLASS;SNORT alerts;behavioral analysis;false alerts;intrusion detection systems;network security;neuro-fuzzy techniques;pattern recognition","","1","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a high percentage of alerts generated by such systems are liable to be false positives. False positives create considerable administrative overheads, since these alerts typically require manual intervention from a network administrator.

The network quarantine channels and associated techniques are used to perform further interaction with hosts that have been identified as the source of suspicious traffic. The network quarantine channels are used to provide a more accurate assessment of the potential attacks sent by suspicious hosts, before sending the final status of the alerts to the IDS monitor for the network administrator's response","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198807","","Data analysis;Databases;Frequency;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Prototypes;Remote monitoring;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication channels;telecommunication traffic","administrative overheads;detection capability;false positives;intelligent infrastructure strategy;intrusion detection systems;network quarantine channels;suspicious network traffic","","0","","41","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new algorithm is thus proposed to get efficiently maximum throughput by the traffic filtering, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in real network circumstances. The algorithm shows its advantages that it is with high average detection and with low false alarm and miss alarm.
