This approach is applied to Internet2 traffic measurements to evaluate the time duration and spatial spread (number of links affected) of anomalies. Based on the empirical results, a node model is proposed that captures the behavior of anomalies at individual network nodes. The model considers various aspects of anomalies, such as its origin, termination, propagation, duration and volume changes. The derivation of the model parameters requires only local node information, but the model is capable of producing network-wide anomalies whose behavior mimics network wide anomalies. Model is verified by using Internet2 traffic data. Since the proposed model can be specified using only a few parameters, it can be used in place of large anomaly traces with a great data reduction. As extensions, the model is applied over a path and an aggregated model that applies to a neighborhood in the network is also presented. A method to use the graph wavelet components found during the analysis to implement a real-time anomaly monitoring system is also discussed.","0742-1303","978-1-4244-8387-7","","10.1109/LCN.2010.5735749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5735749","Graph wavelets;Internet traffic anomalies;Modeling network anomalies","Analytical models;Cities and towns;Discrete wavelet transforms;Internet;Probability distribution;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet coefficients","Internet;computer network security;graph theory;telecommunication traffic;wavelet transforms","Internet traffic anomaly;Internet2 traffic data;graph wavelet;network-wide anomaly;real-time anomaly monitoring system;spatial behavior;temporal behavior","","2","","24","","","10-14 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20070813","2007","","","1391","1398","A clear deficiency in most of todays anomaly intrusion detection systems (AIDS) is their inability to distinguish between a new form of legitimate normal behavior and a malicious attack based on known previous normal behaviors. This deficiency is known as the lack of generalization ability. The lack of generalization ability of the present AIDS results mainly in two direct consequences. As a first consequence, the current AIDS are capable of detecting neither new sophisticated attacks nor slight variations of known attacks launched against computing systems. The high rate of false positive and false negative alerts generated by the current AIDS is the second consequence. Many research initiatives that utilize machine learning techniques including neural networks have been proposed to overcome the lack of generalization. Unfortunately, most of such research initiatives have intrinsically focused on utilizing static techniques, that perform structural pattern recognition. Temporal pattern processing techniques have not gained much attention in this arena. In this research, we present a novel anomaly intrusion detection system based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) which is a temporal pattern processing technique. We show that RNN can efficiently discriminate novel intrusive behaviors while recognizing new normal behaviors. Thus, they reduce the false positive and negative alarms, and address the lack of generalization problem associated with the current AIDS. The ability of RNN to generalize normal as well as intrusive behavior outperforms Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, a structural pattern recognition technique, in a significant way.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288905","","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Communications Society;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Recurrent neural networks;Research initiatives","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;recurrent neural nets;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;generalization ability;machine learning techniques;malicious attack;recurrent neural networks;structural pattern recognition;temporal pattern processing","","0","","26","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on enhancing the way of detecting anomalous network traffic behaviors by proposing a new two-level detection method that consists of abnormality detection and exact attack type identification. The abnormality detection is performed with the rules generated by Classification and Regression Trees (CART). Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model. As results, we found that our approach shows about 80.03% accuracy in detecting network abnormal behaviors. From a comparative study, we concluded that our proposed SVM-based predictive model is superior to a broadly known NN-based predictive model for identifying exact types of attacks.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051958","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Fractals;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","computer network security;feature selection;regression analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","CART;DoS attack;Higuchi fractal dimension;Probes attack;R2L attack;SVM-based predictive model;U2R attack;abnormality detection;anomalous network traffic behavior detection;attack type identification;classification-and-regression trees;computing infrastructure security;feature extraction;feature selection;mean measure;median measure;network abnormal behavior detection;network traffic behavior monitoring;overlapping sliding window operation;standard deviation;statistical analysis;statistical measures;support vector machine;two-level detection method;two-level monitoring method","","0","","30","","","13-15 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem greatly limits the high performance of a signature-based NIDS in a large operational network. In this paper, we present a context-aware packet filter scheme aiming to mitigate this problem. In particular, our scheme incorporates a list technique, namely the blacklist to help filter network packets based on the confidence of the IP domains.

However, there has only a few research related to similarity evaluation under data stream contexts. The main reason is because of the native feature of data streams, namely, large, continuous, and only one pass scan. It is hard to find an efficient method to evaluate similarity over data streams. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm ESDS(estimating similarity over data streams), which not only can estimate similarity efficiently over data streams under the time warping distance but is the first time to use DTW(dynamic time warping) distance based on the sliding window to deal with similarity evaluation over data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first paper to address this problem. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm, we present a simple but efficiently method to denote the original stream data. In computing the distance of DTW between data streams by using dynamic programming, we also introduce a new distance of DTW which can compute the similarity over data streams efficiently. The experiments of many real and synthetic data sets show that our algorithm can evaluate the similarity over data streams efficiently and not be studied in the previous research.","","978-0-7695-2874-8","","10.1109/FSKD.2007.274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406201","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer networks;Data analysis;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Electrostatic discharge;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Sun","data handling;dynamic programming;security of data;time warp simulation","data streams;dynamic programming;dynamic time warping;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor queries","","1","","18","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Numerous soft computing based approaches have been proposed to detect computer network attacks. This paper presents an approach based on extension matrix and genetic algorithm to network misuse detection. Based on extension matrix formed on positive and negative examples, we set up the integer-programming model (IPM) for optimal rule extraction and feature subset selection. Then genetic algorithm is applied to solve IPM and optimal rules are generated for intrusion detection. Those generated rules are then used to detect or classify network intrusions in a real-time environment. Experimental results show the achievement of high true positive rates and acceptable low false positive rates based on benchmark DARPA data sets on intrusion","","1-4244-0475-4","","10.1109/COGINF.2006.365684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4216399","Misuse intrusion detection;extension matrix;genetic algorithm","Computer networks;Computer security;Educational institutions;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness","computer networks;genetic algorithms;integer programming;security of data;telecommunication security","Internet;computer network attack detection;computer system;extension matrix;feature subset selection;genetic algorithm;integer-programming model;intrusion detection system;network misuse detection;optimal rule extraction;security threat;soft computing","","1","","15","","","17-19 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical mobile phone is packed with sensors, which can be turned on silently by a malicious program, providing invaluable information to the attacker. Detecting such hidden activities through software monitors can be blindfolded and bypassed by rootkits and by anti-forensic methods applied by the malicious program. Moreover, detecting power consumption by software running on the mobile phone is susceptible to similar evasive techniques. Consequently, software based detection of hidden malicious activities, particularly the silent activation of sensors, cannot be considered as trusted. In this paper we present a method which detects hidden activities using external measurement of power consumption. The classification model is acquired using machine-learning multi-label classification algorithms. Our method overcomes the inherent weaknesses of software-based monitors, and provides a trusted solution. We describe the measurement setup, and provide detailed evaluation results of the algorithms used.

Existing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are found to be limited in performance and utility especially once subjected to heavy traffic conditions. It has been observed that NIDS become less effective even when presented with a bandwidth of a few hundred megabits per second. In this work, we have endeavored to identify the causes which lead to unsatisfactory performance of NIDSs. In this regard, we have conducted an extensive performance evaluation of an open source intrusion detection system (Snort). This has been done on a highly sophisticated test-bench with different traffic conditions. We have also used different hardware and software platforms to determine the efficacy of the NIDS under test. Finally, in our results/ analysis, we have identified the factors responsible for the limited performance of Snort.

A masquerade attack is a form of attack wherein the attacker uses someone else's identity or one system assumes the identity of another system. One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine.","","1-4244-1304-4","1-4244-1304-4","10.1109/IAW.2007.381943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267571","GUI usage;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;profiling","Conferences;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Manipulator dynamics;Mice;Operating systems;Real time systems;Tellurium","graphical user interfaces;security of data","GUI usage analysis;graphical user interface;masquerade attack;masquerade detection","","2","","11","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, the detection templates should be modified online, and a template-adjustable adaptive decision fusion algorithm is proposed. There are two benefits in the TAIDS. First, when it is difficult to distinguish current behaviors depending on familiar features, The TAIDS will discriminate them by means of danger theory, making false alarms reduced and the ability of identifying novel attacks enhanced. Second, the adaptive decision templates algorithm allows detection templates to modify dynamically without periodical updating.

We have developed an algorithm that tracks multiple (n) characteristics per flow, and requires updating only the flow's n values upon an event, not all the values for all the flows. The n correlation values are used as coordinates for a point in n-space; two flows are considered correlated if there is a very small Euclidean distance between them.

These Networks are used in many applications in military, ecological, and health-related areas. These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information therefore security is important in WSNs. Routing attacks can have devastating effect on wireless Sensor Network and present a major challenge when designing security mechanisms. Sinkhole attack is the most destructive routing attack for these networks, it enable many other attack. In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack. The algorithm detects sinkhole node by finding the difference of nodes sequence numbers using threshold value. It also shows performance evaluation of AODV with the enhanced secure routing algorithm and existing secure routing algorithm through simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm by considering performance metrics as Throughput, PDR and Packet loss. Simulation is carried out using simulator NS2.","","978-1-4799-6084-2","","10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226170","AODV;Mobile Agent;Sinkhole Attack;Threshold Value;Wireless sensor Networks","Cryptography;Mobile agents;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV based secure routing algorithm;NS2 simulator;destructive routing attack;fake routing information;malicious node detection;mobile agent;packet loss;performance evaluation;performance metrics;security mechanisms;wireless sensor networks","","0","","13","","","5-7 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel real-time QRS detection technique using two-phase hashing is proposed in this paper. Our technique relies more on the data stream corresponding to ECG beats than any particular feature.

Trust computations and management are highly challenging issues in MANETs due to computational complexity constraints, and the independent movement of component nodes. This prevents the direct application of techniques suited for other networks. In MANETs, an untrustworthy node can wreak considerable damage and adversely affect the quality and reliability of data. Therefore, analyzing the trust level of a node has a positive influence on the confidence with which an entity conducts transactions with that node. In this work we present a detailed survey on various trust computing approaches that are geared towards MANETs. We highlight the summary and comparisons of these approaches. In addition, we analyze various works on trust dynamics including trust propagation, prediction and aggregation algorithms, the influence of network dynamics on trust dynamics and the impact of trust on security services.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.042711.00083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770276","Aggregation;MANET;Propagation;Security;Trust Computations","Ad hoc networks;Measurement;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Sensors","computational complexity;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;trusted computing","MANET;computational complexity constraint;mobile ad hoc networks;network dynamics;security services;trust computations;trust computing;trust dynamics","","39","","144","","2011-05-19","Second Quarter 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Previous work that uses mostly audit trails collected from the routing protocol suffers from inadequacy of features to construct a reliable model for detecting anomalous routing behavior. On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CRADS is far superior than conventional protocol-specific detection systems.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-1997-5","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489304","","Ad hoc networks;Communications Society;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cross layer design;Data security;Detectors;Multimedia systems;Routing protocols;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security","CRADS;MANET;ad hoc networks;anomalous routing behavior detection;cross layer routing attack detection systems;cross-layer based routing attack detection system;data reduction;integrated cross layer;linear detectors;multiple protocols;nonlinear detector;nonlinear nature;routing protocol;support vector machine","","5","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By constructing representation vectors for the application categories and calculating the cosine similarity between each category representation vector and newly built-up vector converted from flows to be tested, we can find the application category that a tested flow belongs to. Using real traffic traces we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve 93% overall accuracy and the classification is not affected by the packet arrival sequences (e.g. out of order arrivals). The overall accuracy of the proposed approach is observed to be higher than the widely used C4.5 algorithm by 10% in our experiment when the out of order arrival happens.","","978-1-4673-4942-0","978-1-4673-4940-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477666","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Out of order;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Training;Vectors","Internet;computer vision;decision trees;document handling;pattern classification;queueing theory;telecommunication traffic","BoW model;C4.5 algorithm;Internet traffic classification;bag-of-words model;built-up vector;category representation vector;computer vision;cosine similarity;document classification;packet arrival sequence","","0","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The commonly deployed security devices are firewall, IDS, IPS, anti-virus etc. Potential number of threats is still pervading which are formulated as attacks by combining many unnoticed primitive events. The best solution is to install a Complex Event Processing (CEP) system which can analyze multiple devices to infer attack patterns. Log information of network devices is the best choice for analysis. In a large network, there will be millions of events logged. Correlated analysis of this huge volume of log is the main challenge in Complex Event Processing (CEP) system. We describe a method to reduce the input to the Complex Event Processing (CEP) system, using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

As the popularity of VoIP systems increases, they are being subjected to different kinds of intrusions some of which are specific to such systems and some of which follow a general pattern. VoIP systems pose several new challenges to intrusion detection system (IDS) designers. First, these systems employ multiple protocols for call management (e.g., SIP) and data delivery (e.g., RTP). Second, the systems are distributed in nature and employ distributed clients, servers and proxies. Third, the attacks to such systems span a large class, from denial of service to billing fraud attacks. Finally, the systems are heterogeneous and typically under several different administrative domains. In this paper, we propose the design of an intrusion detection system targeted to VoIP systems, called SCIDIVE (pronounced ""Skydive""). SCIDIVE is structured to detect different classes of intrusions, including, masquerading, denial of service, and media stream-based attacks. It can operate with both classes of protocols that compose VoIP systems - call management protocols (CMP), e.g., SIP, and media delivery protocols (MDP), e.g., RTP. SCIDIVE proposes two abstractions for VoIP IDS - stateful detection and cross-protocol detection. Stateful detection denotes assembling state from multiple packets and using the aggregated state in the rule-matching engine. Cross protocol detection denotes matching rules that span multiple protocols. SCIDIVE is demonstrated on a sample VoIP system that comprises SIP clients and SIP proxy servers with RTP as the data delivery protocol. Four attack scenarios are created and the accuracy and the efficiency of the system evaluated with rules meant to catch these attacks.","","0-7695-2052-9","","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311913","","Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer networks;IP networks;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Streaming media;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet telephony;client-server systems;data communication;protocols;security of data","IP networks;SCIDIVE;SIP proxy servers;VoIP systems;billing fraud attacks;call management protocols;cross-protocol detection;data delivery;denial-of-service intrusion;intrusion detection;masquerading intrusion;media delivery protocols;media stream-based attacks;rule-matching engine;stateful detection;voice traffic transmition;voice-over-IP","","29","4","17","","","28 June-1 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three particular scenarios are highlighted, which showcase this need. When using supervised Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), these systems need labelled datasets to be trained. Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection. The GA has been implemented to automatically provide the set of metrics that generate the most appropriate intrusion detection results.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956736","Automatic Labelling;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Network Traffic Labelling;Unsupervised Anomaly IDS","Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Measurement;Telecommunication traffic","digital forensics;feature selection;genetic algorithms","GA based approach;automatic dataset labelling;feature selection;genetic algorithm;labelled network traffic dataset;offline forensic analysis;real-time implementation;supervised intrusion detection systems;unlabelled dataset;unsupervised anomaly based IDS","","1","","13","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, a variety of flow-based DDoS detection algorithms have been put forward. We have divided the flow-based DDoS attack detection techniques broadly into two categories namely, packet header based and mathematical formulation based. Analyses has been done for two techniques one belonging to each category. The paper has analyzed and evaluated these with respect to their detection accuracy and capability.

In contrast to classifying traffic based on statistics of individual flows in previous studies, we build behavioral profiles of the target application, which describe dominant patterns of the application. Based on the behavioral profiles, a two-level matching is used in identifying new traffic. We first determine if a host participates in the application by comparing its behavior with the profiles. Subsequently, for each flow of the host we compare if it matches with the patterns in the profiles to determine which flows belong to this application.

To overcome this problem, a cooperative intrusion detection model based on scenario is proposed, which is consisted of 5 layers. Topological order, isomorphic transformation and state transition analysis method are applied in the text. For an intrusion case we generate all the possible derived intrusions as an intrusion base. Based on this intrusion base, we present an efficient method to detect such intrusions by using finite automaton. Further, we apply data fusion to analysis suspicious data. A derived intrusion can be seen as an unknown intrusion, in this sense the technique presented in this paper can detect some unknown intrusions.","","1-4244-0963-2","1-4244-0963-2","10.1109/CSCWD.2007.4281552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4281552","CSCW;intrusion detection;scenario;state transition","Automata;Collaborative work;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Fusion power generation;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Leak detection;Postal services","computer networks;finite automata;groupware;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection model;data fusion;finite automaton;isomorphic transformation;state transition analysis method;topological order","","3","","14","","","26-28 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Adaptive sinkhole detection on wireless ad hoc networks","Thumthawatworn, T.; Yeophantong, T.; Sirikriengkrai, P.","Fac. of Sci. & Technol., Assumption Univ., Bangkok","Aerospace Conference, 2006 IEEE","20060724","2006","","","10 pp.","","Wireless ad hoc technology is demanding and continually growing. Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes. Weights and thresholds are used for separating suspicious behaviours from normal ones","","0-7803-9545-X","","10.1109/AERO.2006.1655944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655944","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Paper technology","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","adaptive sinkhole detection;denial-of-services;intrusion detection;security features;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","21","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ICT core of these industrial installations is known as Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA). Traditional ICT security countermeasures (e.g., classic firewalls, anti-viruses and IDSs) fail in providing a complete protection to these systems since their needs are different from those of traditional ICT. This paper presents an innovative approach to Intrusion Detection in SCADA systems based on the concept of Critical State Analysis and State Proximity.

Based on this new viewpoint, we present a four-layer model of artificial immune system (AIS) . Also, a mechanism of reasoning with uncertainty is proposed to increase the detection accuracy. There are three merits of this novel model. First, danger theory provides a method of 'grounding' the immune response to reduce false alarms. Second, each layer of the model can work independently and interact with each other, so the efficiency of detecting is greatly improved. Last, the reasoning with uncertainty allows the model to dynamically adapt to real network traffic.","","978-1-4244-1311-9","","10.1109/WICOM.2007.1554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341329","","Artificial immune systems;Biological system modeling;Computer science;Educational institutions;Grounding;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Uncertainty","artificial immune systems;inference mechanisms;security of data;uncertainty handling","AIS;IDS;artificial immune system;danger theory;four-layer model design;intrusion detection system;network traffic;uncertain reasoning","","0","","10","","","21-25 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the network security detection system, the new technologies such as receiving thread domain, object forwarding domain and file buffer are taken into consideration. It can solve the security detection difficult problem caused by the IPv6 network differences in underlying computer system. Experimental results show that this system can detect the security problem in differential computer system quickly and accurately.

Prior works on traffic classification mainly focus their attentions on dividing Internet traffic into different categories based on application layer protocols (such as HTTP, Bit Torrent etc.). Making traffic classification from another point of view, we divide Internet traffic into different content types. Our technology is an attempt to solve the classification problem of network traffic, which contains unknown and proprietary protocols (i.e., no publicly available protocol specification). In this paper, we design a classifier which can distinguish Internet traffic into different content types using machine learning techniques. Features of our classifier are entropy of consecutive bytes and frequencies of characters. Our method is capable of classifying real-world traces into different content types (including Text, Picture, Audio, Video, Compressed, Base 64-encoded image, Base 64-encoded text and Encrypted). The chief features of our classifier are small computing space (about 1K Bytes) and high classification accuracy (about 81%).","","978-1-4577-1172-5","978-0-7695-4509-7","10.1109/NAS.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005446","entropy vector;file content;machine learning;traffic classification","Accuracy;Cryptography;Entropy;Internet;Machine learning;Payloads;Protocols","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","64-encoded image;Audio;Bit Torrent;HTTP;ISP;Internet service providers;Internet traffic;Picture;QoS;Text;Video;machine learning techniques;network community;traffic classification","","2","","27","","","28-30 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our implementation applied Hadoop for large-scale log analysis with data set from KDD'99 competition as test data. With the distributed system framework, we can analyze a whole data set of KDD'99 by first applying our preprocessing. In addition, we use an anomaly detection model for log analysis. A key challenge is to make anomaly detection work more accurately. For the Kmeans algorithm, a key challenge is to set the appropriate number of the initial cluster (K). Moreover, we discuss whether the number of entries in log files affects the accuracy and detection rate of the system or not. Therefore, our implementation and experimental results describe the appropriate number of cluster and the proper amount of entries in log files.

In addition, we highlight various critical shortcomings that IDSs currently have and define future research tracks for IDSs in wireless sensor networks. Though a few restricted survey works on this topic have already been done, we feel that there is a great need of performing a detailed and comprehensive study on the vital aspects so that the IDS in WSN could be analyzed from all the `need-to-know' angles.
