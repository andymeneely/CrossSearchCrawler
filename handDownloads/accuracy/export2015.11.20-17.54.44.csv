However the speed of data packet capture and analysis doesn't match the network application, which causes a general problem in IDS and the ratio of data packet lost is quite high. Various intrusion detection technologies are widely used to solve this problem. In those technologies, the pattern matching based on knowledge is the most popular technology. It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way. It plays an essential role in the efficiency of intrusion detection system. As network speed and capacity is growing rapid, it is necessary to improve the algorithm of pattern matching to follow the currency. This article describes a quite mature algorithm in the intrusion detection system-BM algorithm, based on which some improvements have been proposed.","","978-1-4577-0271-6","978-0-7695-4413-7","10.1109/DMDCM.2011.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959760","BM Algorithm;Enhanced;Intrusion Detection;Pattern Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Safety","search problems;security of data;string matching","BM algorithm;Boyer-Moore algorithm;IDS system;data packet analysis;data packet capture;data packet lost;false alarm;intrusion detection system;pattern matching","","0","","21","","","15-16 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper compares them in topological structures, initializing ways, learning methods, et al. Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved. Thirdly, clone expansion of antibodies is suppressed by idiotypic effects, thus false positive rate is decreased. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this adaptive detection approach. Compared with the detection approach based on a multilayer perception network, the false positive rate is decreased and the detection accuracy of unknown attacks is increased.","1866-7791","978-1-4244-3844-0","","10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228006","idiotypic networks;intrusion detection;neural networks;pattern recognition","Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Learning systems;Mechatronics;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Pattern recognition","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","Fisher Iris dataset;KDD-CUP-99 database;adaptive detection approach;adaptive intrusion detection approach;antigens;idiotypic networks;initializing ways;learning methods;multilayer perception network;neural networks;pattern recognition technology;topological structures","","5","","11","","","20-21 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SVM is a feed forward neural network with many advantages that comply with the requirements of an IDS. One drawback of this classification algorithm is that its performance depends on some input parameters. Our solution for this optimization problem is to apply swarm intelligence.

"High performance string matching algorithm for a network intrusion prevention system (NIPS)","Weinsberg, Y.; Tzur-David, S.; Dolev, D.; Anker, T.","Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem","High Performance Switching and Routing, 2006 Workshop on","20061016","2006","","","7 pp.","","Intrusion detection systems (IDS) were developed to identify and report attacks in the late 1990s, as hacker attacks and network worms began to affect the Internet. Traditional IDS technologies detect hostile traffic and send alerts but do nothing to stop the attacks. Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) are deployed in-line with the network segment being protected. As the traffic passes through the NIPS, it is inspected for the presence of an attack. Like viruses, most intruder activities have some sort of signatures. Therefore, a pattern-matching algorithm resides at the heart of the NIPS. When an attack is identified, the NIPS blocks the offending data. There is an alleged trade-off between the accuracy of detection and algorithmic efficiency. Both are paramount in ensuring that legitimate traffic is not delayed or disrupted as it flows through the device. For this reason, the pattern-matching algorithm must be able to operate at wire speed, while simultaneously detecting the main bulk of intrusions. With networking speeds doubling every year, it is becoming increasingly difficult for software based solutions to keep up with the line rates. This paper presents a novel pattern-matching algorithm. The algorithm uses a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) and is capable of matching multiple patterns in a single operation. The algorithm achieves line-rate speed of several orders of magnitude faster than current works, while attaining similar accuracy of detection. Furthermore, our system is fully compatible with Snort's rules syntax, which is the de facto standard for intrusion prevention systems","","0-7803-9569-7","","10.1109/HPSR.2006.1709697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1709697","","Associative memory;Computer hacking;Delay;Heart;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Wire","content-addressable storage;security of data;string matching;telecommunication traffic","IDS;NIPS;Snort's rules syntax;TCAM;intrusion detection system;legitimate traffic;network intrusion prevention system;pattern-matching algorithm;string matching algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","16","4","18","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds for Malware Campaign Discovery","Jialong Zhang; Saha, S.; Guofei Gu; Sung-Ju Lee; Mellia, M.","","Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), 2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on","20150723","2015","","","630","641","HTTP is a popular channel for malware to communicate with malicious servers (e.g., Command & Control, drive-by download, drop-zone), as well as to attack benign servers. By utilizing HTTP requests, malware easily disguises itself under a large amount of benign HTTP traffic. Thus, identifying malicious HTTP activities is challenging. We leverage an insight that cyber criminals are increasingly using dynamic malicious infrastructures with multiple servers to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers) and (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) being robust against server takedowns (using multiple backups for each type of servers). Instead of focusing on detecting individual malicious domains, we propose a complementary approach to identify a group of closely related servers that are potentially involved in the same malware campaign, which we term as Associated Server Herd (ASH). Our solution, SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware ASHs by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We build a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positives. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers.","1063-6927","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2015.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164948","","Ash;Communities;IP networks;Malware;Robustness;Servers;Silicon","data mining;hypermedia;invasive software;network servers","HTTP requests;HTTP traffic;ISP;SMASH;cyber criminals;dynamic malicious infrastructures;malicious HTTP activities;malware campaign discovery;malware distribution;systematic mining of associated server herds;undetected malicious servers;zero-day attacks","","0","","31","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the action of intrusion represents variable, complicated, and uncertainty characteristic, they face so many problems to resolve for intrusion detection. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. We propose a hybrid IDS, which combines network and host IDS, with anomaly and misuse detection mode, utilizes auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and applies data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. We use an association rule to track all relevant data dependency rule sets for different access roles using a hierarchical structure. We identify malicious transactions from the transaction logs in the database using the data dependency rule sets. These rule sets are continuously updated and stored in a repository. The optimized algorithm actually improves the performance of IDS. Our approach is shown to reduce data access bottlenecks, and ensures minimal manual intervention for maintaining a secure database.","","978-1-4244-5893-6","978-1-4244-5895-0","10.1109/EBISS.2010.5473646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473646","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Content addressable storage;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Detectors;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Transaction databases","data mining;design;security of data","anomaly detection mode;apriori algorithm;association rule;data mining programs;hybrid detector;intrusion detection system;misuse detection mode;security infrastructures","","1","","6","","","22-23 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It consists of four components, namely, rule-based component, belief combination component, security sensitive history database component and Bayesian learning component. The rule-based component consists of a set of well-defined rules which give independent evidences about a transaction's behavior. An extension of Dempster-Shafer's theory is used to combine multiple such evidences and an initial belief is computed. First level inferences are made about the transaction depending on this initial belief. Once the transaction is found to be suspicious, belief is updated according to its similarity with malicious or genuine transaction history using Bayesian learning. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed intrusion detection system can effectively detect intrusive attacks in databases without raising too many false alarms.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925094","Bayesian learning;Database security;Dempster-Shafer theory;Intrusion detection;Suspicion score","Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Computer security;Data security;Database systems;History;Information security;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Transaction databases","belief networks;database management systems;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;security of data","Bayesian learning component;Dempster-Shafer theory;belief combination component;database intrusion detection;first level inference;rule-based component;security sensitive history database component","","2","","4","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the major challenge in Web applications is that it need to process massive files and data-sets to respond to an increasing number of users requests. These data may range from multimedia data to sensor data. Along with the size of data, user satisfaction is an important constraint imposing Quality of Service requirements. Therefore the use of web clusters becomes necessary for numerous applications, fostering the need of efficient load distribution strategy. This article presents a new load balancing policy called Workload And Cache Aware load balancing (WACA) policy aimed at reducing the information retrieval time of the processor using Bloom Filter Based cache summaries. The WACA is a centralized load balancing algorithm which routes the incoming requests to the machine where the underlying data will most probably be in its cache without overloading any nodes in the cluster. The proposed policy was developed and tested on a load balancing framework called CLOUDIZER, and the performance of the strategy was compared over the traditional algorithms.","","978-1-4673-0673-7","978-1-4673-0672-0","10.1109/IConSCS.2012.6502459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502459","Bloom Filter;Caching;Load balancing","","Web services;cache storage;cloud computing;data structures;quality of service;resource allocation","CLOUDIZER;WACA policy;Web clusters;Web services;bloom filter based cache summary;centralized load balancing algorithm;cloud computing;data-sets;information retrieval time;load balancing framework;load distribution strategy;multimedia data;quality of service requirements;sensor data;traditional algorithms;user satisfaction;workload and cache aware load balancing policy","","0","","11","","","29-31 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze the performance of a flow monitoring application from the perspective of the flow data it has to process. We first identify the changes in the flow data caused by a massive attack and propose a simple queueing model that describes the behavior of the flow monitoring application. Secondly, we present a case study based on a real attack trace collected at the University of Twente and we analyze the performance of the flow monitoring application by means of simulation experiments.

With the recent growth of the Internet such security limitations are becoming more and more pressing. Most of the current network intrusion detection systems relay on labeled training data. An Unsupervised CA based anomaly detection technique that was trained with unlabelled data is capable of detecting previously unseen attacks. This new approach, based on the Cellular Automata classifier (CAC) with Genetic Algorithms (GA), is used to classify program behavior as normal or intrusive. Parameters and evolution process for CAC with GA are discussed in detail. This implementation considers both temporal and spatial information of network connections in encoding the network connection information into rules in NIDS. Preliminary experiments with KDD Cup data set show that the CAC classifier with Genetic Algorithms can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate. Training a NIDWCA (Network Intrusion Detection with Cellular Automata) classifier takes significantly shorter time than any other conventional techniques.","","978-0-7695-3489-3","","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4736940","Cellular Automata;Genetic Algorithms;Network Intrusion Detection Systems","Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Encoding;Genetic algorithms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pressing;Relays;Training data","cellular automata;genetic algorithms;security of data","fixed networks;genetic algorithms;investigating cellular automata;network intrusion detection system","","0","","10","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes) are designed to identify attacks against networks or a host that are invisible to firewalls, thus providing an additional layer of security. NIDSes detect and filter the malicious packets by inspecting packet payloads to find worm signatures. The payload inspection operation dominates the throughput of an NIDS since every byte of packet payload needs to be examined. At network speeds of 1 Gbps or above, it can be difficult to keep up with intrusion detection in software, and hardware systems or software with hardware assist are normally required. This paper presents FTSE, a ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) based pattern matching engine. In this paper we show how FTSE can be used effectively to perform string matching for thousands of strings at multiple-Gigabit speed. We also describe how FTSE can be implemented feasibly with an FPGA/ASIC, a 2.25 Mb TCAM, and a small SSRAM.

Phishing domain take-down is the most promising approach to address this security issue, since there will be nothing there for a misled user to see if the fraudulent website has been removed completely. A key part of the take-down procedure is phishing hosting system trace-back. Traditional phishing hosting machines can be identified relatively quickly by their public DNS name or directly if their IP address is embedded within spam email. However, a newer architectural innovation known as fast-flux networks uses a pool of compromised machines to hide the phishing website hosting system, which makes phishing website trace-back almost impractical. We propose a decentralized collaborative intrusion detection approach to address this defense challenge, which is based on a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) architecture. The participating detection systems are from different ISPs, which allows the fast-flux machines to be monitored. The suspicious communication pattern of fast- flux machines are correlated across different ISPs in a multistage manner, to trace-back the actual phishing website hosting machine. The architecture is scalable and self-healing through its use of a structured peer-to-peer network, and also enables the participants to be self-protecting. The communication is loosely coupled by a publish/subscribe mechanism. Our evaluation results show that our proposed decentralized CIDS is more effective than a fully centralized system.","","978-1-4244-2067-4","","10.1109/NOMSW.2007.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509966","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer science;Gold;Government;Intrusion detection;Iron;Laboratories;Software engineering","Internet;Web sites;groupware;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet service provider;Web sites;fast-flux network;peer-to-peer network;self-healing collaborative intrusion detection architecture;self-protecting collaborative intrusion detection architecture;trace-back fast-flux phishing domain","","4","","25","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we suggest a new method for correlating alerts based on their attributes. We use time windows along with a classification method to distinguish those received alerts that are correlated with the new alert. Time windows are applied for reducing the number of comparisons and improving the accuracy of correlation. Our experiments which were done on DARPA2000 show that while the cost of comparisons dropped noticeably, the correlation method performed accurately.

The AGAAR method is used to select the most relevant attributes that can represent an intrusion detection dataset. In order to improve the performance of GPLS classifier, a new local search strategy is used with genetic programming operators. The main target of using local search strategy is to discover the better solution from the current. The results shown later indicate that classification accuracy improved from 75.98% to 81.44% after using AGAAR attribute reduction for the NSL-KDD dataset.

We propose an effective blacklist URL generation method. We try to discover the URLs in the neighborhood of a malicious URL by using a search engine. Those suspicious neighborhoods around malicious URLs require further investigation to determine their blacklisting candidacy.

In modern integrated systems, there are four potential modes of attack available to an adversary: 1 physical only attack, 2 cyber only attack, 3 physical-enabled cyber attack, 4 cyber-enabled physical attack. Blended attacks involve an adversary working in one domain to reduce system effectiveness in another domain. This enables the attacker to penetrate further into the overall layered defenses. Existing vulnerability assessment (VA) processes and software tools which predict facility vulnerabilities typically evaluate the physical and cyber domains separately. Vulnerabilities which result from the integration of cyber-physical control systems are not well characterized and are often overlooked by existing assessment approaches. In this paper, we modified modification of the timely detection methodology, used for decades in physical security VAs, to include cyber components. The Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool (PACRAT) prototype illustrates an integrated vulnerability assessment that includes cyber-physical interdependencies. Information about facility layout, network topology, and emplaced safeguards is used to evaluate how well suited a facility is to detect, delay, and respond to attacks, to identify the pathways most vulnerable to attack, and to evaluate how often safeguards are compromised for a given threat or adversary type. We have tested the PACRAT prototype on critical infrastructure facilities and the results are promising. Future work includes extending the model to prescribe the recommended security improvements via an automated cost-benefit analysis.","","978-1-4673-4894-2","978-1-4673-4895-9","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497883","Modeling;Power Industry;Risk analysis;Security;Simulation","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer security;Delays;Organizations;Software tools","cost-benefit analysis;critical infrastructures;risk analysis;security of data","PACRAT;Physical and Cyber Risk Analysis Tool;attack delay;attack detection;attack response;automated cost-benefit analysis;blended attack;critical asset security;critical infrastructure facility;cyber components;cyber only attack;cyber-enabled physical attack;cyber-physical control system;cyber-physical interdependency;cyber-physical security vulnerability assessment integration;emplaced safeguard;facility layout;facility vulnerability prediction;high value asset security;layered defense;network topology;physical only attack;physical-enabled cyber attack;security improvement;software tool;system effectiveness reduction","","0","","5","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the advances in sensor fusion, it has become possible to obtain a more reliable and accurate decision for a wider class of attacks, by combining the decisions of multiple intrusion detection systems. In this paper, an architecture using data-dependent decision fusion is proposed. The method gathers an in-depth understanding about the input traffic and also the behavior of the individual intrusion detection systems by means of a neural network supervised learner unit. This information is used to fine-tune the fusion unit, since the fusion depends on the input feature vector. For illustrative purposes, three intrusion detection systems namely PHAD, ALAD, and Snort have been considered using the DARPA 1999 dataset in order to validate the proposed architecture. The overall performance of the proposed sensor fusion system shows considerable improvement with respect to the performance of individual intrusion detection systems.","","978-3-8007-3092-6","978-3-00-024883-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632412","Data-Dependent Fusion (DD Fusion);F-score;Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS);Neural Network;Sensor Fusion","","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;sensor fusion","data-dependent decision fusion;feature vector;intrusion detection systems;neural network supervised learner unit;performance enhancement;sensor fusion","","2","","30","","","June 30 2008-July 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However data leakage and network breach problems still exist and are increasing day by day. This is due to multiple root accounts, top priority privileges, shared root access, shared file system privileges etc. In this paper a new Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to overcome the above stated problem. The objective of this research is to develop a Complex Event Processing (CEP) based Hybrid IDS that integrates the output of the Host IDS and Network IDS into the CEP Module and produces a consolidated output with higher accuracy. The overall deployment protects the internal information system without any data leakage by Stateful Packet Inspection. Multivariate Correlation Analysis (MCA) is used to estimate and characterize the normal behavior of the network and send the values to the CEP Engine which alerts in case of any deviation from the normal pattern.

In this paper, we propose a new data-mining based technique for intrusion detection using an ensemble of binary classifiers with feature selection and multiboosting simultaneously. Our model employs feature selection so that the binary classifier for each type of attack can be more accurate, which improves the detection of attacks that occur less frequently in the training data. Based on the accurate binary classifiers, our model applies a new ensemble approach which aggregates each binary classifierpsilas decisions for the same input and decides which class is most suitable for a given input. During this process, the potential bias of certain binary classifier could be alleviated by other binary classifierspsila decision. Our model also makes use of multiboosting for reducing both variance and bias.

In this collaborative environment, component misbehaviour is one of the most significant security threats. A key countermeasure is the ability to detect behaviour that could jeopardise the integrity, availability or functionality of either the composition or its components. However, due to the heterogeneity of the environment, as well as the uncertainty and dynamics of both the structure and function, component system behaviour is highly dynamic and unpredictable. This poses challenges for existing techniques and casts doubt over their reliability and effectiveness. Therefore potentially allowing behavioural threats to evade detection and yielding high false positive rates. In this paper, we will outline the security concerns that misbehaviour poses in terms of both individual components and the SoS as a whole.

Differences in pixel intensity are calculated and compared with a fuzzy rule base to calculate edginess. This edginess measure is used to decide whether a pixel belongs to an edge or not. Features extracted from training videos train the Naive Bayesian Classifier which is then used for testing videos. Features are pre-processed using techniques such as Discretize, Fuzzy Logic, Numeric to Binary, PKI Discretize and Normalize. Then, they are filtered using Correlation Feature Selection before training the classifier.

Having a GPS receiver on every sensor node is costly. In the past, a number of location discovery (localization) schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes share a common feature: they use some special nodes, called beacon nodes, which are assumed to know their own locations (e.g., through GPS receivers or manual configuration). Other sensors discover their locations based on the reference information provided by these beacon nodes. Most of the beacon-based localization schemes assume a benign environment, where all beacon nodes are supposed to provide correct reference information. However, when the sensor networks are deployed in a hostile environment, where beacon nodes can be compromised, such an assumption does not hold anymore. In this paper, we propose a general scheme to detect localization anomalies that are caused by adversaries. Our scheme is independent from the localization schemes. We formulate the problem as an anomaly intrusion detection problem, and we propose a number of ways to detect localization anomalies. We have conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our scheme, including the false positive rates, the detection rates, and the resilience to node compromises.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419861","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Global Positioning System;Intrusion detection;Personnel;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","GPS receiver;beacon nodes;false positive rates;localization anomaly intrusion detection;sensor node;wireless sensor networks","","11","","42","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this way, the IDS itself will depress overall performance and cannot be guaranteed secure. In this paper, we present an embedded architecture of SPMOS-based IDS. SPMOS, located in SPM, is a little OS running under GPOS. Experiment results show that the architecture is fast. Based on this, we also design a simple IDS and conduct tests by integrating it into SPMOS and GPOS.

Studies have revealed that higher order n-grams are good for capturing the network profile. In this paper we introduce a concept of layered version of n-gram for payload based anomaly network intrusion detection. Each layer works as an independent anomaly detection system. A packet is declared as normal after passing through all the layers. A packet is declared as anomalous if at any layer it is declared as anomalous and we stop further processing the packet. We create a set of bins and equally distribute the distinct n-grams to each bin. Each such n-gram is a 2 tulle where the first element is byte values of the n-gram and second is the frequency of gram in the entire training data. We assign an anomaly score to each bin based on the frequency of the individual gram in the bin and is termed as coverage of the bin.We evaluate the proposed scheme on normal traffic of DARLA 99 dataset mixed with a set of attacks.

As such, this paper proposes a framework for the systematic detection and prevention of botnet, as well as a procedure and method for cooperation.","","978-0-7695-3486-2","","10.1109/SecTech.2008.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725354","botnet;detection;response","Centralized control;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Robots;Web and internet services;Web server","Web services;security of data","ISP;Internet services;botnet detection","","3","","8","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"PERG: A scalable FPGA-based pattern-matching engine with consolidated Bloomier filters","Ho, J.; Lemieux, G.G.F.","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC","ICECE Technology, 2008. FPT 2008. International Conference on","20090127","2008","","","73","80","PERG is an FPGA application that accelerates the process of searching a stream of bytes against a large, fixed database of string patterns. The stream could be network, disk, or file traffic, while the pattern database may represent computer viruses, spam, keyword sequences, or watermarks. A full pattern, or rule, consists of a sequence of one or more segments separated by gaps. Each segment is an exact sequence of bytes, possibly 100s of bytes long. Each gap contains arbitrary bytes, but is a known length. PERG uses a pattern compiler to transform a database of these rules into a hardware implementation. To the authorspsila knowledge, this is the first pattern match engine hardware designed for large virus databases. It is also first among network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), which are similar in nature to PERG, to implement Bloomier filters. Like hash tables, Bloomier filters produce false positives due to aliasing, so all potential matches must be verified by exact matching. However, Bloomier filters are more powerful than their ancestral Bloom filters because they can identify the exact rule of a potential match. This enables two key advantages for PERG. First, it allows PERG to use a checksum to very efficiently reduce false positives. Second, exact matching with PERG filters is much faster than with Bloom filter systems because only one suspect pattern needs to be checked, not all patterns. To reduce memory requirements, PERG packs as many segments as possible into each Bloomier filter by consolidating several different segment lengths into the same filter unit. This is done by dividing each segment into two smaller but overlapping fragments of the same length. Dividing into non-overlapping fragments would create shorter fragments of uneven lengths, leading to higher false positives and differing lengths to consolidate later. Using the ClamAV antivirus database, PERG fits 80,282 patterns containing over 8,224,848 characters into a single modest FPGA chi- - p with a small (4 MB) off-chip memory. It uses just 26 filter units, resulting in roughly 26x improved density (characters per memory bit) compared to the next-best NIDS pattern match engine which fits only 1/250<sup>th</sup> the characters. PERG can scan at roughly 200 MB/s and match the speed of most network or disk interfaces.","","978-1-4244-3783-2","978-1-4244-2796-3","10.1109/FPT.2008.4762368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4762368","","Acceleration;Application software;Databases;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic","computer viruses;field programmable gate arrays;filters;pattern matching;program compilers;very large databases","Bloomier filters;ClamAV antivirus database;FPGA-based pattern-matching engine;PERG;hardware implementation;large virus databases;network intrusion detection systems;pattern compiler","","2","","22","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, there is a need to design security scheme with the capabilities to protect the network and the sink node on the occurrence of attack. In this paper, we aim to provide security with a reactive security scheme that includes studying the behavioral aspect of attacks and congregating the security demands. This scheme successively conglomerates the security and the network rescue mechanism free from attacks and their impacts on the network.

As a smart spectrum sharing technology, cognitive radio can change its transmitter parameter based on interactive the environment where it operates. So the MAC address can be easy spoofed in the open air. An attacker can exploit this character to preempt spectrum resources and bring the negative impact to the network. In this paper, we propose a scheme of detecting identity-spoof attack based on Back Propagation (BP) network. The scheme extracts the fingerprint feature of cognitive user to get the received signal strength (RSS). The extracted Eigen values can be used as the input vectors of the BP neural network which are trained by the honest users' RSS. The honest users and the attackers can be divided into two categories by the trained BP network to detect an identity-spoof attack.

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed.

We did this and evaluated the speed, memory requirements, and accuracy of the detection engines in three kinds of experiments: (1) on the full traffic of our school as observed on its "" backbone"" in real time, (2) on a supercomputer with packets recorded from the backbone, and (3) in response to malicious packets sent by a red-teaming product. We used the same set of rules for both products with a few small exceptions where capabilities were missing. We conclude that Suricata can handle larger volumes of traffic than Snort with similar accuracy, and that its performance scaled roughly linearly with the number of processors up to 48. We observed no significant speed or accuracy advantage of Suricata over Snort in its current state, but it is still being developed.

Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a new bio-inspired model which is applied for solving various problems in the field of information security. The unique features AIS encourage the researchers to employ this techniques in variety of applications and especially in intrusion detection systems. Proper IDS design is essential to improve the performance of the IDS. The centralized design of this IDS has disadvantage of central processing for massive processes for each packets passing trough network. In this paper we proposed a distributed multi-layerd framework to enhance the detection performance and efficiency of this IDS. In our design the genetic algorithm is used for enhancing the secondary immune response. The fundamental design of our proposed AIS based IDS consists of 2 main components: IDS central engine and detection sensors. Each of these components is composed of some agents which correlate with each other in order to detect the anomalies and intrusions.

The advantage of the taken approach allows us to demonstrate the superiority of the neural networks over the systems that were created by the winner of the KDD Cups competition and later researchers due to their capability to recognize an attack, to differentiate one attack from another, i.e. classify attacks, and, the most important, to detect new attacks that were not included into the training set. The results obtained through simulations indicate that it is possible to recognize attacks that the intrusion detection system never faced before on an acceptably high level","","0-7695-2497-4","","10.1109/ITNG.2006.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1611629","","Computer science;Databases;Expert systems;Face recognition;Geographic Information Systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Neural networks;Petri nets","neural nets;security of data","anomaly detection based intrusion detection;neural networks","","6","","9","","","10-12 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key problem is how to minimize the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network when identifying misbehaviors. Our approach to this problem is based on a distributed, cluster-based anomaly detection algorithm. We minimize the communication overhead by clustering the sensor measurements and merging clusters before sending a description of the clusters to the other nodes. In order to evaluate our distributed scheme, we implemented our algorithm in a simulation based on the sensor data gathered from the Great Duck Island project. We demonstrate that our scheme achieves comparable accuracy compared to a centralized scheme with a significant reduction in communication overhead","","1-4244-0411-8","1-4244-0411-8","10.1109/ICCS.2006.301508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085803","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Detection algorithms;Energy consumption;Fault diagnosis;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Software engineering;Wireless sensor networks","fault diagnosis;wireless sensor networks","Great Duck Island project;clustering;data gathering;distributed anomaly detection algorithm;fault diagnosis;intrusion detection;wireless sensor network","","40","","14","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, many real-world scenarios require a classification decision well before a flow has finished even if the flow's beginning is lost. This implies classification must be achieved using statistics derived from the most recent N packets taken at any arbitrary point in a flow's lifetime. We propose training the classifier on a combination of short sub-flows (extracted from full-flow examples of the target application's traffic). We demonstrate this optimisation using the naive Bayes ML algorithm, and show that our approach results in excellent performance even when classification is initiated mid-way through a flow with windows as small as 25 packets long.

The approach, KM+1R, combines the k-means clustering with the OneR classification technique. The KDD Cup '99 set is used as a simulation dataset.

These attacks are more difficult to detect than the flooding DDoS attacks. This paper explores the energy distributions of Internet traffic flows in frequency domain. Normal TCP traffic flows present periodicity because of protocol behavior. Our results reveal that normal TCP flows can be segregated from malicious flows according to energy distribution properties. We discover the spectral shifting of attack flows from that of normal flows. Combining flow-level spectral analysis with sequential hypothesis testing, we propose a novel defense scheme against RoQ attacks.

We implemented a prototype of such a module on a Linux system in order to experimentally verify the feasibility and efficacy of our idea.

Current CPS Monitoring and Analysis (M&A) technologies are inadequate for realizing effective, pervasive, and efficient defense. Such technologies do not consider that cyber and physical convergence would need a new paradigm that treats cyber and physical components seamlessly. Further, information sharing was always prohibited to maintain the presumed, implicit parameter-defense protection for the Target of Defense (ToD) privacy. These assumptions lead to drastic limitations negatively impacting the quality, reliability, survivability, and promptness of the defense service provisioning. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Sensory system EvoSense towards realizing pervasive M&A for heterogeneously composed targets. EvoSense is a biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient, situation-aware sense and response system to seamlessly effect biological-immune-system-like defense. EvoSense acts as a middle layer between the defense service provider(s) and the ToD creating a uniform defense interface that hides ToD's scale and heterogeneity concerns from control and management. EvoSense is elastic where solutions are dispatched through a dynamic set of sensors and effectors to the ToD rather than using pre-deployed M&A components. EvoSense circulates context-driven, online customizable sensing and effecting capsules into the ToD body to pervasively monitor, analyze and control ToD components. The key design principles are: ToD-independent defense service provisioning; decoupling sensing and effecting tools from the control and management logic towards enabling interoperable and dynamic defense; and intrinsically supporting trustworthy scalable cooperative defense with shared indicators. Using analysis and simulation, our results demonstrate that EvoSense can enhance detection and resolution promptne- s and sensitivity to multi-threaded widespread attacks while saving considerable amount of ToD resources.","","978-1-4673-2708-4","","10.1109/THS.2012.6459829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459829","Analysis;Autonomic Management;Biologically-inspired Security;Cyber Physical Systems;Elastic Computing;Monitoring;Ubiquitous Computing","Computer architecture;Digital signal processing;Microprocessors;Monitoring;Organisms;Privacy;Sensors","safety;security of data;software reliability;system monitoring;ubiquitous computing","CPS analysis technology;CPS monitoring technology;EvoSense;bioinspired evolutionary sensory system;biological-immune-system-like defense;biologically-inspired intrinsically-resilient system;critical infrastructure system;cyber-physical system defense;defense service provider;defense service provisioning;efficiency enhancement;information sharing;parameter-defense protection;pervasive M&A;reliability enhancement;response system;safety enhancement;situation-aware sense system;target of defense privacy;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research, we present an entropy-based network traffic profiling scheme for detecting security attacks. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. The purpose of the first stage is to systematically construct the probability distribution of relative uncertainty for normal network traffic behavior. In the second stage, we use the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, a calculation that measures the level of difference of two probability distributions, to detect abnormal network activities. The probability distribution of the relative uncertainty for short-term network behavior is compared with that of the long-term profile constructed in the first stage. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme for DoS attacks with the dataset derived from KDD CUP 1999.
