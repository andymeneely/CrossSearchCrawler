In this framework, multimodal biometrics are used for continuous authentication, and intrusion detection is modeled as sensors to detect system security state. We formulate the whole system as a partially observed Markov decision process considering both system security requirements and resource constraints. We then use dynamic programming-based hidden Markov model scheduling algorithms to derive the optimal schemes for both intrusion detection and continuous authentication. Extensive simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2009.071036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4786442","Security;authentication;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks","Authentication;Biometrics;Biosensors;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Multimodal sensors;Protection;Security;Sensor systems","Markov processes;ad hoc networks;dynamic programming;mobile radio;scheduling;telecommunication security","Markov model scheduling algorithms;biometric-based continuous authentication;detection-based approaches;dynamic programming;high security mobile ad hoc networks;multimodal biometrics;optimal combined intrusion detection;prevention-based approaches","","13","","18","","","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most of the current commercially available intrusion detection systems use signature-based rules to detect attacks. A serious defect-with this approach is that it only detects attacks that have been seen previously. It cannot detect newly encountered attacks. As a means to overcome this defect, various research has been undertaken using data mining to automatically detect newly encountered attacks. Our research follows this approach. However, we propose the use of an entropy based data mining method without using the APRIORI based data mining method which is commonly used in the previous research on intrusion detection. Because the results of APRIORI are noisy, post-processing of its results are necessary.

A network has to be continuously monitored for detecting policy violation or suspicious traffic. So an intrusion detection system needs to be developed which can monitor network for any harmful activities and generate results to the management authority. Data mining can play a massive role in the development of a system which can detect network intrusion. Data mining is a technique through which important information can be extracted from huge data repositories. In order to spot intrusion, the traffic created in the network can be broadly categorized into following two categories- normal and anomalous. In our proposed paper, several classification techniques and machine learning algorithms have been considered to categorize the network traffic. Out of the classification techniques, we have found nine suitable classifiers like BayesNet, Logistic, IBK, J48, PART, JRip, Random Tree, Random Forest and REPTree. Out of the several machine learning algorithms, we have worked on Boosting, Bagging and Blending (Stacking) and compared their accuracies as well. The comparison of these algorithms has been performed using WEKA tool and listed below according to certain performance metrics.

The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together. Our experiment was performed at a large local institute network for two months, and all the features were studied with big data, which includes ~400 million DNS queries.

"Intelligent Network Infrastructure Systems Architecture and Integration, Risk Management and Validation","Hooper, E.","London Univ., Egham","Systems Conference, 2007 1st Annual IEEE","20070625","2007","","","1","7","There are major challenges for effective strategies for intelligent systems architecture and integration, risk management and validation in engineering and network systems. This includes the challenges in designing intelligent engineering systems to reduce false positives and increases detection capability of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). The high percentage of alerts and false positives generated by IDSs are among the significant problems. We present intelligent systems architecture and integration, including risk management and validation for reduction of false positives and infrastructure protection using a novel approach using adaptive responses from firewall packet filters in what we call, network quarantine channels (NQC). This includes risk assessments and design of integrated virtual private networks (VPNs) and strategic controls via packet filters, which collaborate with the NQC to reply to suspicious hosts, and them deny access to sensitive data servers in the infrastructure. The firewall packet filters provide effective intelligent responses by to granting access to the normal packets and denying malicious traffic access to the network, after the identity of the connections are verified through the statistical analysis in the NQC. These effective strategies reduce false positives and increases detection capability of the IDS. The intelligent systems at the system-of-systems level include systems modeling and simulation, systems engineering education, training, quality management for intrusion detection, computer security and disaster response. The validation includes statistical analysis and modeling of systems integration for handling large-scale and complex systems in emerging commercial networks. This includes large-scale systems integration various applications for technology transfer between academia and industry, and applicable to communications systems, medical systems, management and sustainability. The paper examines issues in robust design- , factors, safety, security and usability, and transitions from design to production, deployment and use, quality control and system management and management interactions, risk management and systems architecture.","","1-4244-1041-X","1-4244-1041-X","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2007.374667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258872","communications systems;large-scale systems integration applications;medical systems;risk management;systems architecture and integration;technology transfer academia and industry;validation systems","Filters;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Modeling;Quality management;Risk management;Statistical analysis;Systems engineering and theory;Virtual private networks","risk management;security of data;statistical analysis;systems analysis;systems engineering;virtual private networks","academia;adaptive response;communications system;computer security;design to production;disaster response;firewall packet filter;integrated virtual private networks;intelligent engineering systems design;intelligent network infrastructure systems;intrusion detection system;large-scale system;medical system;network quarantine channel;network systems;packet filters;quality control;quality management;risk assessment;risk management;risk validation;statistical analysis;strategic control;system management;system-of-systems;systems architecture;systems engineering education;systems engineering training;systems modeling;systems simulation;technology transfer","","1","","20","","","9-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dynamic forensics using IDS or honeypot are all based on a common hypothesis that the system is still in a reliable working situation and collected evidences are believable even if the system is suffered from intrusion. In fact, the system has already transferred into an insecurity and unreliable state, it is uncertain that whether the intrusion detectors and investigators could run as normal and whether the obtained evidences are credible. Although intrusion tolerance has been applied in many areas of security for years, few researches are referred to network forensics. The work presented in this paper is based on an idea to integrate intrusion tolerance into dynamic forensics to make the system under control, ensure the reliability of evidences and aim to gather more useful evidences for investigation. A mechanism of dynamic forensics based on intrusion forensics is proposed. This paper introduces the architecture of the model which uses IDS as tolerance and forensics trigger and honeypot as shadow server, the finite state machine model is described to specify the mechanism, and then two cases are analyzed to illuminate the mechanism.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207895","dynamic forensics;finite state machine;intrusion tolerance","Automata;Control systems;Distributed processing;Forensics;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Protection;Real time systems","finite state machines;security of data","dynamic forensics;evidence reliability;finite state machine model;honeypot;integrate intrusion tolerance;intrusion detection system;network forensics;security","","0","","15","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, by gratuitous ARP request packets, we propose a solution to the problem of ARP poisoning. Our suggested mechanism which is named a Gratuitous Decision Packet System (GDPS) seeks to achieve two main goals: (1) Detection of suspicious ARP packets, by implementing a real-time analyzing for received ARP packets. (2) The distinction between a legitimate and malicious host through sending a modified request packet of the gratuitous ARP packets.

Increases in electricity demand with inadequate delivery infrastructure and cyber-physical attack threats due to technological interdependencies introduce more complex events. Accurate and timely power system event identification and detection have great significance in system operation, monitoring, and control processes. Insufficient and slow event information may lead to catastrophes. Significant research effort is being made toward developing robust monitoring systems using advanced state of the art technologies such as synchrophasor technologies. This paper extends our previous work [1] and proposes a model that leverages the causal relationship between devices in cyber physical systems. Causal event graphs (CEG), a modified version of Bayesian networks, are used to create unique paths that model deterministic signatures of each cyber-physical event. The CEG and Bayesian network can be incorporated to event detection systems (EDS) to classify cyber physical events. A causal event graph for each scenario can be created using a sequence of power system events, measureable states, and logs from different sources. A modified IEEE 9 bus system with multi zone distance protection schemes for two transmission lines is used to demonstrate the proposed concept. A total of 22 cyber-physical scenarios are mapped into CEG and Bayesian networks to define rules for cyber-power system events.","","","","10.1109/PESGM.2014.6939285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6939285","Bayesian network;CEG;EDS;cyber-physical;scenarios;synchrophasor","Bayes methods;Circuit faults;Monitoring;Phasor measurement units;Power system stability;Relays","belief networks;graph theory;phasor measurement;power transmission lines;power transmission protection","Bayesian networks;IEEE 9 bus system;causal event graph;cyber-physical attack threats;cyber-power system events;event detection systems;multizone distance protection;power system event identification;robust monitoring systems;synchrophasor technology;transmission lines","","0","","18","","","27-31 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to ensure high security this work focuses on multiple classifier fusion technique to increase detection rate. The primary role of classifier is to classify the correct and incorrect instance therefore multiple classifier design that is practical, and detects more attack by means of combining them is preferred here. To our best knowledge, this is the first design that considers multiple classifier in which all classifiers are different that detects both anomalies based and misuse based attacks. The dataset collected in a networking environment with the relatively high data density may contain attacks that assaults the system and thus violates system security. In this paper the operation of combining multiple classifiers that detects all categories of attack, from that improving the detection rate and true positive rate thereby reducing the false positive rate can be done. Decision based on threshold value and combining the classifiers result based on majority voting rule helps to increase the overall efficiency and accuracy in detecting the various categories of attack.","","978-1-4799-3826-1","","10.1109/ICCPEIC.2014.6915405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915405","Fusion;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Majority Voting Rule;Multiple Classifier","","security of data;sensor fusion","detection methodologies;diversified intrusion detection;intrusion detection system;misuse based attacks;multiple classifier fusion technique;security;sensor fusion;threshold value","","0","","17","","","16-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to security vulnerabilities of the routing protocols, wireless ad-hoc networks are unprotected to attacks of the malicious nodes. One of these attacks is the Sinking Behaviour and Collision Behaviour Attack against network integrity absorbing all data packets in the network. Since the data packets do not reach the destination node on account of this attack, data loss will occur.

Furthermore, LS-SVM adopts equality constraints and squared functions, which leads to solve an easy-to-compute linear system, however followed is the lack of sparseness, all training data will become the support vector of LS-SVM, which cause the low intrusion detection speed. This paper proposed a novel LS-SVM intrusion detection model using kernel space approximation through greedy searching, thus constructed a subspace basis of original space populated by training data. Through this approximation, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate LS-SVM model were reduced, which greatly helped to improve the response time of intrusion detection. The kernel-target alignment method was utilized to obtain optimal Gaussian kernel parameter and 10-fold cross-validate method to obtain optimal trade-off parameter.

To run our algorithm, the network is divided into clusters and three types of nodes called header, monitor and general node are defined in each cluster. Header node initiate intrusion detection process by sending start packet for general nodes in its cluster, Based on the messages that it receives during the detection process, each monitor node determines the general nodes it suspects to be malicious and sends his vote to the header node, finally header node detect malicious nodes by analyzing these votes. This algorithm is independent of any routing protocol. Using trust-worthy nodes in voting process, defining three confidence levels for the general nodes, also taking into account the traffic rate, remaining energy and speed of general nodes in the decision making phase, considerably reduces the negative impact of natural limitation of these networks on accuracy detection, increasing the number of malicious nodes will not have any effect in accuracy of this algorithm and it is possible to detect all malicious nodes simultaneously.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599816","Attack;False Detection;MANET;Voting;intrusion Detection System","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","cooperative communication;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data","cooperative intrusion detection algorithm;general node;header;mobile ad hoc network;monitor;trust-worthy nodes;trusted voting","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Misuse detection is the most popular approach to detect intrusions, using a library of signatures to find attacks. The accuracy of the signatures is paramount for an effective IDS, still today's practitioners rely on manual techniques to improve and update those signatures. We present a system, called pSigene, for the automatic generation of intrusion signatures by mining the vast amount of public data available on attacks. It follows a four-step process to generate the signatures, by first crawling attack samples from multiple public cyber security web portals. Then, a feature set is created from existing detection signatures to model the samples, which are then grouped using a biclustering algorithm which also gives the distinctive features of each cluster. Finally the system automatically creates a set of signatures using regular expressions, one for each cluster. We tested our architecture for SQL injection attacks and found our signatures to have a True and False Positive Rates of 90.52% and 0.03%, respectively and compared our findings to other SQL injection signature sets from popular IDS and web application firewalls. Results show our system to be very competitive to existing signature sets.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903566","SQL injection;biclustering;signature generalization;web application security","Clustering algorithms;Computer security;Databases;Feature extraction;Manuals;Portals","SQL;authorisation;data mining;digital signatures;portals","IDS;SQL injection attack;SQL injection signature;Webcrawling;biclustering algorithm;crawling attack;data mining;intrusion detection system;misuse detection;pSigene;public cyber security Web portal","","0","","44","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performing anomaly detection in real-time places hard requirements on the algorithms used. First, to deal with the massive data volumes one needs to have efficient data structures and indexing mechanisms. Secondly, the dynamic nature of today's information networks makes the characterization of normal requests and services difficult. What is considered as normal during some time interval may be classified as abnormal in a new context, and vice versa. These factors make many proposed data mining techniques less suitable for real-time intrusion detection. In this paper we extend ADW ICE, anomaly detection with fast incremental clustering. Accuracy of ADW ICE classifications is improved by introducing a new grid-based index, and its ability to build models incrementally is extended by introducing forgetting. We evaluate the technique on the KDD data set as well as on data from a real (telecom) IP test network.

However, for evaluation, most of the researchers used KDD Cup 99 data set, which has widely criticized for not showing current network situation. In this paper we used a new labelled network dataset, called Kyoto 2006+ dataset. In Kyoto 2006+ data set, every instant is labelled as normal (no attack), attack (known attack) and unknown attack. We use Decision Tree (J48) algorithm to classify the network packet that can be used for NIDS. For training and testing we used 134665 network instances. The generated rules works with 97.2% correctness for detecting the connection i.e., no attack, known attack or unknown attack.","","978-1-4799-8790-0","","10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275914","Data Mining;Decision tree;Intrusion Detection System;J48 algorithm;Kyoto data set","Accuracy;Data mining;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","J48 decision tree algorithm;KDD Cup 99 dataset;Kyoto 2006+ dataset;cyber attacks;data mining technique;machine learning technique;network intrusion detection system;network packet classification","","","","","","","10-13 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the numerous smart meters being connected through mesh networks open new opportunities for attackers to interfere with communications and compromise utilities' assets or steal customers' private information. The goal of this paper is to survey the various threats facing AMIs and the common attack techniques used to realize them in order to identify and understand the requirements for a comprehensive intrusion detection solution. The threat analysis leads to an extensive “attack tree” that captures the attackers' key objectives (e.g., energy theft) and the individual attack steps (e.g., eavesdropping on the network) that would be involved in achieving them. With reference to the attack tree, we show the type of information that would be required to effectively detect attacks. We also suggest that the widest coverage in monitoring the attacks can be provided by a hybrid sensing infrastructure that uses both a centralized intrusion detection system and embedded meter sensors.","","978-1-4673-0910-3","978-1-4673-0909-7","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2012.6486016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6486016","","Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mesh networks;Monitoring;Routing;Sensors","metering;power system security;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","AMI threat analysis;advanced metering infrastructures;attack detection;attack tree;centralized intrusion detection system;common attack techniques;comprehensive intrusion detection solution;embedded meter sensors;hybrid sensing infrastructure;mesh networks;smart meters","","11","","14","","","5-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Architecture for evaluating and correlating NIDS in real - World networks","Koch, R.; Golling, M.","Fac. of Comput.

In order to (i) evaluate multiple IDS under absolutely identical conditions and to (ii) check their reactions especially against novel attack patterns / attacker behaviour, all attack related actions (i.e. all traffic) have to be forwarded to all IDS in parallel at real-time. In addition, an attractive target needs to be offered to potential attackers, awaking the outward semblance of real-productive systems / networks including the corresponding behaviour. In particular, the correlation of IDS seems a promising approach to compensate the individual deficiencies of IDS. For example, while knowledge based systems are only able to detect previously known attacks, anomaly based systems suffer from higher False Alarm Rates (FARs). Even more, periodic performance evaluation studies, e.g., by NSS-Labs, have illustrated that numerous IDS are not configured properly and have a much worse system performance and detection capability than announced by the vendors. However, changing parameters of systems in productive networks (for the correlation of IDS as well as for their evaluation) can result in an enhanced endangerment of the security or even a breakdown of the network in case of horrible misconfigurations. To overcome these shortcomings, we present an architecture that supports research in the field of IT security and simultaneously ensures that all actions associated with an attack get recorded and a spill over of the attack from the research to the productive environment is prevented. Each test system is supplied with an unaltered live record of the network traffic. This allows an assessment of the detection as well as a comparison of different NIDS concepts/products. In addition, different correlation strategies of alerts of multiple systems can be evaluated. Furt- ermore, superior configurations can be identified and assessed without endangerment of the productive network.","2325-5366","978-1-4799-0450-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568386","comparative evaluation;intrusion detection;intrusion detection correlation;optimization;real-world evaluation;test environment","Charge coupled devices;Correlation;Databases;Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Sensors","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IT security;IT systems;NIDS;detection capability;false alarm rates;intrusion detection systems;knowledge based systems;network traffic;periodic performance evaluation studies;real - world networks;real-productive systems;system performance;unaltered live record","","2","","29","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this new method, the audit data streams obtained from sequences of system calls and UNIX commands are used as the information source. The audit data is partitioned into segments with a fixed length. Program and user behaviors are, in turn, measured by the frequencies of individual system calls or commands embedded in each segment of the data, and NMF is applied to extract the features from the blocks of audit data associated with the normal behaviors. The model describing the normal program and user behaviors are built based on these features and deviation from the normal program and user behaviors above a predetermined threshold is considered as anomalous. The method is implemented and tested with the system call data from the University of New Mexico and the Unix command data from AT&T Research lab.

The use of Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture can foster the effective implementation of TE through a centralized engine devoted to end-to-end path computations. However, despite authentication, authorization and encryption, confidentiality issues may arise due to abuses of information included in path computation replies to bogus requests issued by malicious PCEs. This paper first demonstrates the security leak allowing the exposure of intra-domain information in current inter-PCE path computation procedures. Then it proposes an anomaly-based approach, namely PCE Anomaly Detector (PAD) in order to detect malicious utilization of path computation services. The proposed PAD employs a novel double-step multi-dimensional formulation based on the Sequential Hypothesis Testing (SHT) statistical classification procedure, able to recognize a suspicious sequence of requests while aiming at inferring confidential information about other domains. PAD is extensively evaluated through simulations. Results show good performance in terms of detection capabilities while guaranteeing the trade-off between accuracy and responsiveness, minimizing false alarm occurrences. Robustness against smart attacks is also proved with respect to a comprehensive set of attack patterns and under different network load conditions.

It consists of four significant enhancements: enhanced threshold-based training, dynamic input normalization, feedback-based quantization error threshold adaptation, and prediction confidence filtering and forwarding. We test the capability of the A-GHSOM approach for intrusion detection using the KDD'99 dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with eight representative intrusion detection approaches, A-GHSOM achieves significant overall accuracy improvement and significant improvement in identifying ""unknown"" attacks while maintaining low false-positive rates.

Thus, in a SSO based system, robust persistent authentications and secure session termination management are vital for ensuring secure operations. In this paper we propose a novel persistent authentication technique using multiplicative attribute graph model. We use multiple attribute based persistent authentication model using facial biometrics, location and activity specific information. We propose a novel membership (or group affiliations) based session management technique for user initiated SSO global logout management.

The construction of traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that use manually created rules based upon expert knowledge is knowledge-intensive and is not suitable in the context of this big data problem. This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks.

In this paper, we report our progress in the development of an agent-based cooperative anomaly detection scheme for wireless ad hoc networks. The approach addresses the underlying distributed and cooperative nature of wireless ad hoc networks and adds one more dimension of cooperation to the intrusion detection process. That is, the anomaly detection is performed in a cooperative way involving the participation of multiple mobile nodes. Unlike traditional signature-based misuse detection approaches, the proposed scheme detects various types of intrusions/attacks based on the model learned only from normal network behaviors. Without the requirements of pre-labeled attack data, the approach eliminates the time-consuming labeling process and the impacts of imbalanced dataset.

How to quickly perceive the traffic anomaly is a new demand in the network anomaly detection. Due to the shortage of the conventional detection methods in terms of speed, a fast anomaly detection scheme is proposed in this paper, which is based on the iterative estimation of Hurst parameter. The anomaly can be determined through the value of estimation.

Security analysts are likely to play an important role in protecting computer networks by accurately and timely detecting cyber attacks. However, currently little is known on how certain cognitive factors might influence the analyst's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the role of two cognitive factors, recency and inertia, that are likely to influence a simulated analyst's detection of cyber attacks. We use an existing cognitive model, based upon Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), which represents the working of a simulated analyst. We manipulate the reliance on recency of information and the reliance on inertia and evaluate the effects of these manipulations on the model's accurate and timely detection of cyber attacks in a simulated cyber attack scenario. The IBL model is defined by recency: more or less reliance on recent information; and, inertia: low inertia dependence and high inertia dependence. Results reveal that although both recency and inertia influenced accuracy; the timeliness is influenced by inertia but not by recency. We highlight the implications of our findings for decision making of human security analysts.","","978-1-4673-4527-9","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514428","Cyber attacks;Instance-Based Learning Theory;cognitive modeling;inertia;recency","Accuracy;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Equations;Firewalls (computing);Mathematical model","computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence)","IBLT;cognitive factors;cognitive model;computer network protection;cyber attacks;cyber threat detection;effect testing;human security analysts;inertia;instance-based learning theory;malicious events;recency","","0","","10","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increase of the availability and use of such applications calls for careful attention to the possibility of transferring malformed, incorrect, or malicious SIP messages as they can cause problems ranging from relatively innocuous disturbances to full blown attacks and frauds. To this end, SIP messages are analyzed to be classified as “good” or “bad” depending on whether this structure and content are deemed acceptable or not. This paper presents a classifier of SIP messages based on a two stage filter. The first stage uses a straightforward lexical analyzer to detect and remove all messages that are lexically incorrect with reference to the grammar that is defined by the protocol standard. The second stage uses a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the structure of the remaining syntactically correct messages in order to detect semantic anomalies which are deemed a strong indication of a possibly malicious message. The SVM “learns” the structure of the “good” and “bad” SIP messages through an initial training phase and the SVM thus configured correctly classifies messages produced by a synthetic generator and also “real” SIP messages that have been collected from the communication network at our institution. The preliminary results of such classification look very promising and are presented in the final section of this paper.","1930-529X","978-1-4673-0920-2","978-1-4673-0919-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503527","","","pattern classification;signalling protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","SVM;communication network;machine learning approach;malicious SIP message classification;protocol standard;session initiation protocol;sessions-based applications;straightforward lexical analyzer;support vector machine;syntax filter;two-stage filter","","0","","15","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless links. The routers and hosts are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily. It allows mobile nodes to communicate directly without any centralized coordinator. Such network scenarios cannot rely on centralized and organized connectivity, and can be conceived as applications of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Thus, MANET is vulnerable due to its dynamic network topology, as any node become untrusted at any time. The Black hole attack is one kind of security risk in which malicious node advertises itself to have a shortest path for any destination, to forge data or for DOS attack.

However, peer-to-peer traffic may compromise the performance of enterprise critical networked applications or network-based tasks or may overload the network infrastructure of Internet service providers, being desirable that this traffic be blocked in some situations. However, this task may be difficult to achieve, namely for networks operating at very high-speed bit rates and low latency and/or when the traffic is encrypted. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and blocking encrypted traffic generated by eMule, which is one of the most difficult to detect among popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The proposed method is based on eMule signatures, which are coded as SNORT rules, this system being used to detect and block eMule traffic.

Artificial neural networks provide a feasible approach to model complex engineering systems such as intrusion detection. Applications of artificial neural networks to characterize the behavior of users have been well studied in the recent past, without considering the enormous time they take to get modeled. In this paper we present an implementation of a parallel version of the back propagation training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks that are used for detecting intruders based on the MPI standard on Linux PC clusters.

To ensure a good level of security, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been widely deployed and many techniques to detect, identify and classify attacks have been proposed, developed and tested either offline or online. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based detection technique using a genetic algorithm named Genetic Clustering for Anomaly-based Detection (GC-AD). GC-AD uses a dissimilarity measure to form k clusters. It, then, applies a genetic process where each chromosome represents the centroids of the k clusters. A two-stage fitness function is proposed. i) We introduce a confidence interval to refine the clusters in order to obtain partitions that are more homogeneous. ii) We compute and maximize the inter-cluster variance over the generations. The accuracy of our technique is tested on different subset from KDD99 dataset. The results are discussed and compared to k-means clustering algorithm.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176182","Anomaly-based IDS;KDD 99;clustering;false negative rate;false positive rate;genetic algorithm","Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Statistics","genetic algorithms;pattern clustering;security of data","GC-AD;IDS;KDD99 dataset;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;clustering-based detection technique;computer systems;dissimilarity measure;genetic algorithm;genetic clustering technique;k-means clustering algorithm;network resources security;two-stage fitness function","","0","","19","","","1-3 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present the preliminary results of applying correlation coefficients to detecting stepping-stone intrusion. The contribution of this paper is that we are the first to apply correlation coefficient to stepping-stone detection, and more importantly, it does not have to monitor a session for a long time to conclude if there is a stepping-stone intrusion.

RIDS is a session oriented, statistical tool, that relies on training to mold the parameters of its algorithms, capable of detecting even distributed stealthy reconnaissance attacks. It consists of two main functional modules or stages: the reconnaissance activity profiler (RAP), followed by the reconnaissance alert correlation (RAC), along with a security console. RAP is a session-oriented module capable of detecting stealthy scanning and probing attacks, while RAC is an alert-correlation module that fuses the RAP alerts into attack scenarios and discovers the distributed stealthy attack scenarios, RIDS has been evaluated against two data sets: (a) the DARPA'98 data, and (b) 3 weeks of experimental data generated using the CONEX testbed, running at average Ethernet speeds. RIDS has demonstrably achieved remarkable success; the false positive, false negative and misclassification rates found are low, less than 0.1%, for most reconnaissance attacks; they rise to about 6% for distributed highly stealthy attacks; the latter is a most challenging type of attack, which has been difficult to detect effectively until now. Thus, the RIDS system promises to provide an early warning by detecting the reconnaissance first phase of an impending attack, even if it is very stealthy and distributed.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437816","","Data security;Ethernet networks;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Prototypes;Reconnaissance;Senior members;Student members;System testing","security of data;system monitoring","alert correlation;anomaly detection;distributed stealthy reconnaissance attack;reconnaissance intrusion detection system;session oriented statistical tool","","0","","13","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A user using a vulnerable browser or browser plug-ins may become a victim of a drive-by-download attack right after visiting a vicious web site. The end result of such attacks is that an attacker can download and execute any code on the victim's host. This paper proposes a runtime, behavior-based solution, BrowserGuard, to protect a browser against drive-by-download attacks. BrowserGuard records the download scenario of every file that is loaded into a host through a browser. Then based on the download scenario, BrowserGuard blocks the execution of any file that is loaded into a host without the consent of a browser user. Due to its behavior-based detection nature, BrowserGuard does not need to analyze the source file of any web page or the run-time states of any script code, such as Javascript. BrowserGuard also does not need to maintain any exploit code samples and does not need to query the reputation value of any web site. We utilize the standard BHO mechanism of Windows to implement BrowserGuard on IE 7.0. Experimental results show that BrowserGuard has low performance overhead (less than 2.5%) and no false positives and false negatives for the web pages used in our experiments.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963164","Web browser;drive-by-download attack;heap spray;intrusion detection;malware;system security","Browsers;Internet;Kernel;Malware;Servers;Web pages","Web sites;security of data","BrowserGuard;Javascript;cyber community;security threats;vulnerable browser;web applications;web page;web site","","4","","36","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
