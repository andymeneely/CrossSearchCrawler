Such a system must outpace the propagation of threats, handle complexities in a large-scale environment, deal with interruption attacks on dissemination, and also secure itself. Revere addresses these problems by building a large-scale, self-organizing, and resilient overlay network on top of the Internet. We discuss how to secure the dissemination procedure and the overlay network, considering possible attacks and countermeasures. We present experimental measurements of a prototype implementation of Revere gathered using a large-scale-oriented approach. These measurements suggest that Revere can deliver security updates at the required scale, speed and resiliency for a reasonable cost.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2003.818808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1258125","","Broadcasting;Costs;IP networks;Information security;Internet;Large-scale systems;Power system security;Prototypes;Unicast;Velocity measurement","Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","Internet;Revere overlay network;certificate revocation list updates;dissemination procedure;early-warning signals;interruption attacks;resilient self-organizing overlay networks;secure network;security update delivery;virus signatures","","8","","26","","","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself. We present a pattern recognition approach that addresses both of these issues. It utilizes an ensemble of a classifiers approach to intelligently combine information from multiple sources and is explicitly tuned toward minimizing the cost of the errors as opposed to the error rate itself. The information fusion approach dLEARNIN alone is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances better than those reported in the literature so far, and the cost minimization strategy dCMS further reduces the cost with a significant margin.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598829","Cost minimization;dCMS;dLEARNIN;data fusion;pattern recognition for intrusion detection","Computer networks;Cost function;Error analysis;Humans;Information resources;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pattern recognition","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;sensor fusion","anomaly detection;cost minimization;data fusion;information fusion approach;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;misuse detection;pattern recognition algorithms","","8","","39","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To be effective, a NIDS must be able to counter evasion attempts and operate at or near wire-speed. Failure to do so allows malicious packets to slip through a NIDS undetected. In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in SnortÂ¿s ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets. Experimental results using a live system show that an attacker needs only 4.0 kbps of bandwidth to perpetually disable an unmodified NIDS, whereas all intrusions are detected when our countermeasure is used.","1063-9527","0-7695-2716-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041157","","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Counting circuits;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Protocols;TCPIP;Wire","","","","13","1","26","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANET routing disrupts if participating node do not perform its intended function and start performing malicious activity. A specific attack called Wormmhole attack enables an attacker to record packets at one location in the network, tunnels them to another location, and retransmits them into the network. In this paper, we present a protocol for detecting wormhole attacks without use of any special harware such as directional antenna and precise synchronised clock and the protocol is also independent of physical medium of wireless network. After the route discovery, source node initiates wormhole detection process in the established path which counts hop difference between the neighbours of the one hop away nodes in the route. The destination node detects the wormhole if the hop difference between neighbours of the nodes exceeds the acceptable level. Our simulation results shows that the WHOP is quite excellent in detecting wormhole of large tunnel lengths.","","978-1-4577-0311-9","","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2011.5893822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5893822","","Ad hoc networks;Delay;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Synchronization","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;synchronisation","MANET routing;WHOP;clock synchronisation;directional antenna;hound packet;malicious activity;routing protocol;wormhole attack detection protocol","","6","","15","","","25-27 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, these methods don't achieve a high performance of learning.

The monitoring crew will be responsible for identifying the anomaly within the aircraft and take necessary preventive actions. With the introduction of additional technology within the aircraft, mere human perception may not be sufficient to make a decision.

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","","978-1-4673-2433-5","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.","","","","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947","Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis","Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine","","0","","21","","","24-26 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the routinely produced analytical data from computer networks are usually of very huge in size. This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches. The experimental results show that our hybrid model is promising in detection compared to the previously reported results.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011237","Feature selection;Floating search;Intrusion detection;Least square support vector machines;Mutual information","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Redundancy;Support vector machines;Training","feature selection;filtering theory;least squares approximations;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;LSSVM;feature selection approach;filter selection process;intrusion detection data classification;least square support vector machine;wrapper selection process","","0","","30","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612","","Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network","","9","","26","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can deliver satisfactory system performance with less network load.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356567","","Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Computer architecture;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis","security of data","DARPA dataset;attack tools;collaborative architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;network technologies;noncentral analyzer;one-level hierarchy dIDS;security","","3","","31","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization method, which is not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, the proposed ABC-SVM model is applied to determine free parameters of SVM and feature selection at building intrusion detection system. The standard ABC is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine and the binary ABC is to obtain the optimum feature selection for IDSs from KDD Cup 99 data set.

IDS for MANETs have attracted much attention recently and thus, there are many publications that propose new IDS solutions or improvements to the existing. In this paper, we study the different existing IDS architectures for MANETs. We briefly present for each architecture, after an analysis, the strengths and weaknesses, the methods/techniques that have been proposed to improve the performances and the provided security services.

The proposed detection system maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross-layer features to define a routing behavior. For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed. Experiments based on simulation show that the proposed cross-layer approach aided by a combination of SVM and FDA performs significantly better than other existing approaches.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374416","Cross-layer design;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;routing attacks;sinking.","","ad hoc networks;radio networks;support vector machines;telecommunication security","Fisher discriminant analysis;MAC layer;autonomous host-based intrusion detection;cross-layer detection;malicious node behavior;malicious sinking behavior;packet drop ratio;security vulnerabilities;support vector machines;traffic density;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","28","","2010-01-08","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, an attack that is detected after it has occurred is, in essence, a successful one. Advance warning of potential attacks could aid in their detection. Before an attack is launched the attacker often performs reconnaissance on the target host or network to learn its vulnerabilities. If malicious network reconnaissance can be detected and identified, it can serve as a warning of future attacks and may provide clues as to the identity of the attacker.

The proposed approach for incremental learning of concept drift considers mining, where the streaming data distributions change over time.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).","1550-6002","978-1-4244-8078-4","978-0-7695-4131-0","10.1109/QSIC.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949","Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing","computer network security;program testing","IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing","","3","","21","","","14-15 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, authentication mechanisms are the only barrier to prevent those attacks. Traditional password-based authentication is efficient (especially from the user point of view), but not effective -- the lack of continuous verification is a severe access control vulnerability. To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials. Therefore, extending the IDS concept to the user authentication level appears as a promising security control. The need to distinguish human users (user-centric anomaly-based detection) leads to the use of biometric features. In this paper we present a secure, reliable, inexpensive and non-intrusive technique for complementing traditional static authentication mechanisms with continuous identity verification, based on keystroke dynamics biometrics.","","978-1-4673-2624-7","","10.1109/CyberC.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384970","access control;authentication;biometrics;identity theft;intrusion detection;keystroke dynamics;security","Access control;Authentication;Databases;Humans;Intrusion detection;Keyboards","authorisation;message authentication","access control vulnerability;continuous access control enforcement;continuous identity monitoring;digital identities;host-based IDS concept;human users;information systems;keystroke dynamics biometrics;legitimate user credentials;malicious activity;non-intrusive technique;password-based authentication;security control;static authentication mechanisms;user-centric anomaly-based detection","","2","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low.

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","","978-1-4244-0973-0","978-1-4244-0973-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because WSNs in general and in nature are unattended and physically reachable from the outside world, they could be vulnerable to physical attacks in the form of node capture or node destruction. These forms of attacks are hard to protect against and require intelligent prevention methods. It is necessary for WSNs to have security measures in place as to prevent an intruder from inserting compromised nodes in order to decimate or disturb the network performance. In this paper we present an intrusion detection algorithm for wireless sensor networks which does not require prior knowledge of network behavior or a learning period in order to establish this knowledge. We have taken a more practical approach and constructed this algorithm with small to middle-size networks in mind, like home or office networks. The proposed algorithm is also dynamic in nature as to cope with new and unknown attack types.

Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications.

To collect useful samples, PMCU uses P2P software actively search suspicious samples, such as software crack tools. During a 3-year period, PMCU has collected 42300 samples. To automatically classify useful samples, AMCU uploads suspicious samples to VirusTotal, a free online virus scanner. Based on VirusTotal scanning results, 11600 suspicious samples have been alerted at least once by AntiVirusWare (AVW) and 70% of these samples are Trojans and Virus tools, which are usually threatening malwares. Moreover, these suspicious 11600 samples are classified into: Blacklist with high suspiciousness; Ambitious list with moderate suspiciousness; Whitelist with low suspiciousness. Blacklist can be used to evaluate the performance of AVW based on False Negative (FN). On the other hand, Whitelist can be used to evaluate the performance of AVW based on False Positive (FP). From Blacklist and Whitelist, AMCU selects useful malwares, which triggering high counts of FN and FP against AVW.","","978-1-4799-3196-5","","10.1109/InfoSEEE.2014.6946241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6946241","AntiVirusWare (AVW);Blacklist;False negative (FP);False positive (FP);Malware sample;Whitelist","Databases;Grippers;Software;Testing;Trojan horses","computer viruses;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing","AMCU;AVW;P2P software;PMCCS;PMCU;Trojans tools;antivirusware;automatic malware classification unit;blacklist;false negative;false positive;proactive malware collection unit;proactive malware collection-and-classification system;system security;virus scanner;virus tools;virustotal;whitelist","","0","","12","","","26-28 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications.

In this paper, we focus on the angle detection accuracy of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme, which is one of primary factors for rapid establishment of FSO links. The positioning process is composed of two parts. One is the spot location, which acquires the position of the imaging spot of the incident beam. The other is the mapping from spot location to incident angle, with which the position of imaging spot can be turned into the angles of the incident beam. For the first part, an improved centroid locating algorithm is present to realize the subpixel accuracy of spot location, and theory and simulation are carried out to demonstrate the improved accuracy of this algorithm. For the second part, we propose the fisheye lens calibration algorithm, which integrates the fisheye lens projection model and natural neighbor interpolation algorithm. In addition, by combining with the measured data, the angle detection accuracy of this method can be improved gradually with the increased number of the measured data. The simulation results indicate that this new method can provide high-precision positioning of the laser beams, and the maximum angle detection error of this ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme can be less than 0.054° (0.94 mrad).","0733-8724","","","10.1109/JLT.2014.2360313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915668","Fisheye lens calibration;fisheye lens calibration;free space optical link;high-accuracy angle detection;spot location;ultra-wide field-of-view acquisition;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition","Accuracy;Imaging;Interpolation;Laser beams;Lenses;Measurement by laser beam;Optical fiber communication","calibration;laser beams;lenses;optical communication equipment;optical images;optical links;optical projectors;photodetectors","Voigt anomalous dispersion optical filter;centroid locating algorithm;fisheye lens calibration algorithm;fisheye lens projection model;free-space optical links;high-accuracy angle detection;high-precision laser beam positioning;incident angle;incident beam imaging spot;integrated optics;natural neighbor interpolation algorithm;ultrawide FOV acquisition scheme;ultrawide field-of-view acquisition scheme","","0","","21","","2014-10-02","Dec.1, 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A formal framework for signature-based IDS event detection is developed to aid this discussion. Through this framework it is shown that, even for the simplest case of a single isolated attack, time correlation is not a sufficient approach for noncoincidently located heterogeneous sensors due to the nondeterministic nature of network propagation delays. An approach is then discussed to include additional information about the knowledge domains of the respective IDS sensors, at a per trigger level, to improve the correlation accuracy.","","0-7803-7978-0","","10.1109/PACRIM.2003.1235911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1235911","","Clocks;Computer networks;Failure analysis;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Observability;Payloads;Propagation delay;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","handwriting recognition;safety systems;sensors;telecommunication security","correlation accuracy improvement;data volume overwhelming;event detection;heterogeneous IDS system;heterogeneous sensor;intrusion detection system;network propagation delay;signature-based IDS alert;time-based correlation","","0","","7","","","28-30 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed. The design is hardware based and suitable for networking and security querying applications.","","","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926138","Bloom filter;H3 hash function;compactness;counting bloom filter;cryptographic hash function field programmable array;false positive ratio;membership querying;parallel bloom Filter;standard bloom Filter;whirlpool hash function","Arrays;Cryptography;Hardware;Information filters;Radiation detectors;Standards","cryptography;data structures;dictionaries;field programmable gate arrays","Xilinx;arbitrary length;bloom filter variants;bloom filters;cryptographic hash function whirlpool;data structure technique;dynamic membership querying;false positive ratios;field programmable gate array;fixed-length output;hash based structures;information compaction;intelligent dictionary;mapping scheme;network security;networking application;noncryptographic form;performance matrix;security application;spell check application;target technology;universal H3 hash function;whirlpool hash based bloom filter","","0","","30","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data mining techniques are efficient to construct a reliable Intrusion Detection System. Classification is an essential task in data mining. In this paper, a new classification method is proposed to build an accurate and efficient classifier for intrusion detection. The new classification method utilizes the average distances of the new data to its closest neighbor points to classify it as normal or intrusion. Then, the distances of the data to the centroids of normal, misuse intrusion and anomaly intrusion is used to get the accurate class label of the data. In addition, this paper integrates Fuzzy GNP-based class association rule mining method to extract rules. Fuzzy GNP avoids the use of the domain knowledge and solves the continuous attributes efficiently. On the basis of the extracted rules, the multi-feature space is projected into a two-dimensional average matching degree space.

However, they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks, especially in the routing layer because of their open environment and the communication happens based on the mutual trust among the nodes. An appropriate intrusion detection system is an inevitable requirement. Using anomaly based intrusion detection system results in the false positive identification of the intrusion. Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed. The proposed anomaly detection system uses artificial neural networks and Dempster-Shafer theory to confirm the attack occurrence in the network.","","978-1-4799-8466-4","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229722","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Adhoc Network;Security attacks;Self organizing maps;Trust computation","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing","computational complexity;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;neural nets;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET secure routing establishment;anomaly based intrusion detection system;artificial neural network;computational complexity;false positive identification;fly networking","","0","","14","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, as the cloud platform is quickly evolving and becoming more popular in our everyday life, it is useful and necessary to build an effective IDS for the cloud. However, existing intrusion detection techniques will be likely to face challenges when deployed on the cloud platform. The pre-determined IDS architecture may lead to overloading of a part of the cloud due to the extra detection overhead. This paper proposes a neural network based IDS which is a distributed system with an adaptive architecture so as to make full use of the available resources without overloading any single machine in the cloud. Moreover, with the machine learning ability from the neural network, the proposed IDS can detect new types of attacks with fairly accurate results. Evaluation of the proposed IDS with the KDD dataset on a physical cloud testbed shows that it is a promising approach to detecting attacks in the cloud infrastructure.","","978-1-4673-1855-6","","10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664371","Anomaly detection;Cloud security;Distributed IDS;Neural network","Artificial neural networks;Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Servers;Training","cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","KDD dataset;adaptive architecture;attack detection;cloud platform;distributed system;machine learning;network security;neural network based IDS;neural network based distributed intrusion detection system;pre-determined IDS architecture","","0","","14","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this equilibrium property will be violated by some anomalies. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-dimensional Clustering method for Short-time scale Traffic(MCST) to classify abnormal and normal traffic. We compare our new method to the well known wavelet technique. The detection result on synthetic anomaly traffic shows MCST can better detect the low-rate attacks than wavelet-based method, and detection result on real traffic demonstrates that MCST can detect more anomalies with low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4577-1668-3","","10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077018","","Data models;Educational institutions;Entropy;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;IP networks;Training","Gaussian distribution;data communication;data mining;entropy;pattern clustering;security of data;telecommunication traffic;wavelet transforms","Gaussian distribution;anomaly detection;entropy;equilibrium property;false alarm rate;feature stability;multidimensional clustering method;packet level traffic feature;short time scale traffic;statistical analysis;traffic volume;wavelet technique","","3","","26","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method leveraging the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm to passively identify switches composing the network path of an anomaly. As SDN technologies tend to be deployed in the next generation of networks including in data centers, they provide a helpful framework to implement our proposal without developing dedicated routers like usual IP traceback techniques.
