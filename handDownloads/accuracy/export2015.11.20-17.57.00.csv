Anti-virus solutions can detect a high percentage of malicious files but usually cannot reach and maintain a 100% detection rate. We propose a file-level IDS that relies on automated dynamic analysis system (sandbox) to detect malicious PDF files. We achieved a 99.2% detection rate, where the rates of both the false positives and the false negatives are less than 1%. Because it does not rely on anti-virus signatures, this solution can detect malicious documents that utilize malware not covered by the anti-virus database.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665213","","Databases;Portable document format","","","","0","","16","","","25-27 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Differentiated services (DiffServ) QoS model is adopted by many recent and upcoming networks standard. Applications running on these networks can specify suitable service classes to their connections or flows. The flows are then treated according to their service classes. However, current Internet applications are still designed based on best-effort scheme and, therefore, cannot benefit from QoS support from the network. An automatic flow classification framework, which can automatically classify non QoS-aware flows or legacy flows, has been proposed in our earlier work [2]. In this paper, we extend our framework by introducing new features that can be effectively used to classify legacy flows. The simplicity of these features allows the data to be collected in real-time. No packet-level data are required. Furthermore, the framework is evaluated using multiple data sets from different users. The results show that our framework works extremely well in general and it can be operated independently from any applications, networks or even machine learning algorithms. Average correctness up to 98.82% is achieved when the framework is used to learn and classify unseen flows from the same user. Cross-user classifications yield average correctness up to 74.15%.","","978-953-6114-93-1","978-953-6114-95-5","10.1109/SOFTCOM.2007.4446129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446129","","Application software;Communication standards;Communications technology;Computer science;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Throughput","DiffServ networks;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","automatic flow classification;differentiated services;legacy flow classification;machine learning;network standard;packet-level data","","2","","30","","","27-29 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the last years these threats have reached a new quality of automatization and sophistication, rendering most defenses ineffective. Conventional security measures that rely on the manual analysis of security incidents and attack development inherently fail to provide a timely protection from these threats. As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses. In this paper, we reconsider the problems, challenges and advantages of combining machine learning and computer security.

However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected.

With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns.

We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and non-worm traffic. We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain, however, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the power spectral density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding spectral flatness measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from non-worm traffic.

PSO is an optimization method which has a strong global search capability and is used for fine-tuning of the features whereas RF, a highly accurate classifier, is used here for classification. We demonstrate the performance of our technique using KDD99Cup dataset.

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999911","Android Malware;Android malware;Behavioral Analysis;Dynamic Analysis;Obfuscation;Static Analysis;Stealth Malwar;behavioral analysis;dynamic analysis;obfuscation;static analysis;stealth malware","Androids;Google;Humanoid robots;Malware;Smart phones;Tutorials","Android (operating system);application program interfaces;invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;smart phones","API;Android device;Android malware application;Internet;SMS;application programming interface;dynamic-analysis-based method;location-based service;malware detection techniques;malware penetration;multimedia services;next-generation Android security enforcement mechanism;office application;prevalent stealth techniques;signature-based analysis method;smartphone OS security;static analysis method;static analysis methods;vehicle guidance;voice call","","0","","143","","2014-12-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3","978-1-4244-6939-0","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Intrepid MicroTrack leaky cable sensor","Harman, R.K.","Southwest Microwave Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA","Security Technology, 2002. Proceedings. 36th Annual 2002 International Carnahan Conference on","20021210","2002","","","191","197","Intrepid MicroTrack is the first leaky coaxial cable sensor to utilize FM CW radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. The first leaky coaxial cable sensor, introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, used pulse radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. Since then, there have been numerous papers on CW leaky cable sensors that detect, but do not locate intruders. Like Southwest Microwave's MicroPoint, the acoustic cable sensor introduced at the 1994 Carnahan conference, MicroTrack offers several new features, including the ability to precisely locate intruders. These features greatly improve sensor performance. This paper describes the technology and its broad range of applications including buried, surface and barrier mounted. MicroTrack is an ultra wide band (UWB) HF terrain-following radar. FM CW radar techniques are well known and have been widely used in radio altimeters and police radar for many years. However, it is only with the advent of low cost direct digital synthesis (DDS) chips, high speed and high resolution analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital processing components that it is now practical to apply FM CW radar techniques to leaky cables. MicroTrack uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to translate the swept frequency response into precise target location. The frequency diversity associated with the ultra wide bandwidth assures uniform detection along the length of the sensor cable.

The real-time efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection is greatly influenced by the scale of signature database and the approach of intrusion data analysis. In this paper, a typical set method is provided to compress the normal signature database. Using the data set of UNM CERT sendmail for testing, the feasibility of typical set method is validated, and a proper rate of typical set for intrusion detection is proposed. Meanwhile, the LSM (Linux Security Modules) framework is presented to hook system calls and other audit data from operation system to build intrusion detection system signature database and identify intrusion activity.

The system is trained using a 66% of randomly selected connections in as a subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection data set. The training model is created by a trained classifier and then used to classify the remaining 34% subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset in order to report on the effectiveness of the model. The results show that based on a selected set of features extracted using subset evaluation algorithm for classifiers and a best-first search mechanism, that decision tree algorithm J48 based on C4.5 provides 99.95% of correctly classified instances and is better than the Naïve Bayes technique. Also found was that false positives using Naïve Bayes are high for Probing and Remote to Local attack categories.

For these purposes, approaches based on the profiling of users are not as common as those based on the analysis of the system behavior. This paper presents a method for automatically profiling and subsequently predicting the behavior of computer system users. The method is based on evolutionary profiling agents evolving in real time in order to dynamically provide a profile for each subject under analysis. The paper presents some experimental results from real data providing scheduled time and the real effective use of resources made by users of a high performance computing (HPC) center. The resulting profiling turns out to be very good for most users and the consequential relative error between prediction and effective activities appears as an effective parameter in detecting both changes in user behavior and user identity usurpation","","1-4244-0241-7","1-4244-0241-7","10.1109/MSHS.2006.314353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107733","Behavior prediction;agents;evolutionary algorithms;neural networks;profiling","Ear;Electrical capacitance tomography;Ovens","evolutionary computation;human factors;multi-agent systems;neural nets;user modelling","HPC center;artificial cognitive agents;artificial neural networks;automatic profiling;behavior prediction;computer system users;evolutionary profiling agents;high performance computing;intrusion detection;system behavior","","1","","6","","","18-19 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is a main cause of high false rates and inaccurate detection rates in IDS. In this paper, we propose a new approach named quantitative intrusion intensity assessment (QIIA). QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal. We carry out several experiments on KDD 1999 dataset and show the evaluation results.","","978-0-7695-3849-5","","10.1109/PRDC.2009.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368241","Feature Selection;Intrusion Detection System;Paramter Optimizations;Proximity Metrics;Random Forests","Aerospace engineering;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication computing;USA Councils","security of data;software metrics","KDD 1999 dataset;feature selection;inaccurate detection rates;intrusion detection system;proximity metrics;proximity metrics computation;quantitative intensity value;quantitative intrusion intensity assessment;random forest","","0","","20","","","16-18 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the particularity of network security, a tool DTAD (dynamic taint analysis detector) for information flow security detection is designed and implemented, aiming at the problem of data security in network access. This tool performs log recording and state controlling for malicious access and virus vulnerability using the state-control characteristic of virtual machines. Defense systems capture network data by executing applications to determine whether these accesses (i.e. target jumping, function address and instruction access) are legitimate or not. Once an attack is detected, the tool records states of the virtual machine at the process level as well as the kernel level. For attacks caused by malicious code, the tool injects its own diagnostic code into the process space of running programs to substitute the malicious code, as a result, related information for the attacked process is collected. The tool is able to generate precise signatures for network intrusion detection by associating and comparing network data recorded in log files with process information collected by the virtual machine, the whole process is finished automatically. The tool can also precisely identify attack types and provide effective protection measures through fast signature releasing. Experiments have validated the efficiency of the tool in attack recognition and information protection, and indicated that this detection and protection system is effective in recognizing, tracking and processing taint data.","","978-0-7695-3185-4","978-0-7695-3185-4","10.1109/WAIM.2008.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597071","","Costs;Data security;Detectors;Information analysis;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Virtual machining;Viruses (medical)","computer viruses;program diagnostics;virtual machines","attack recognition;computer systems;data security;defense systems;diagnostic code;dynamic taint analysis detector;information flow security detection;information infection;information leakage;information protection;information security;log recording;malicious access;network access;network intrusion detection;state control;virtual machines;virus vulnerability","","0","","28","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
