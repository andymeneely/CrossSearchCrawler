Usually, network researchers develop their own tools, sometimes from scratch, to fit the requirements of their experimentations, and these tools are then abandoned when the paper is published. In this study, we emphasize the importance, for the network research community, to use and contribute to the development of open source measurement tools. In this regard, we propose a survey and classification of IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters and open source tools available to collect or estimate these parameters. We highlight the parameters that can be extracted from wireless traffic probes and those that are available through the driver of wireless cards. Then, we introduce and compare open source tools that can be used to make the measurements, with special attention to the flexibility of the tools and their application scope. Finally, we discuss with several case studies the combination of tools that best suit the needs of the wireless experiments and provide a list of common pitfalls to avoid.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2010.021110.00020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451769","IEEE 802.11;open source software;probes;wireless analyzers;wireless measurements;wireless parameters","","mathematical analysis;probes;protocols;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters;mathematical analysis;open source measurement tools;taxonomy;wireless cards;wireless network protocols;wireless traffic probes","","7","1","55","","2010-04-19","Second Quarter 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Identifying intrusions in computer networks with principal component analysis","Wang, W.; Battiti, R.","Dept. of Comput.

The First International Conference on","20060508","2006","","","8 pp.","","Most current anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDSs) detect computer network behavior as normal or abnormal but cannot identify the type of attacks. Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","6","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The insider attacker detection scheme proposed in this paper meets all the requirements by exploring the spatial correlation existent among the networking behaviors of sensors in close proximity. Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities. Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors. Our algorithm is purely localized, fitting well to the large-scale sensor networks.

Machine learning techniques can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and generate classifiers that are used to detect attacks on computer system. In general the input to classifiers is in a high dimension feature space, but not all features are relevant to the classes to be classified. Feature selection is a very important step in classification since the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features often degrade the performance of classification algorithms both in speed and accuracy. In this paper, we have considered three different approaches for feature selection, Chi square, Information Gain and ReliefF which is based on filter approach.

But, the plug-in-and-play architecture of WMNs paves way for malicious users who could exploit some loopholes of the underlying routing protocol. A malicious node can inundate the network by conducting frequent route discovery which severely reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we investigate the detection of route floods by incorporating a machine learning technique. We use a perceptron training model as a tool for intrusion detection. We train the perceptron model by feeding various network statistics and then use it as a classifier.

The change it advises of logically centralizing the overall network control on software platforms and applications, turns networks more and more into software-based systems. Such paradigm shift enables to build more manageable, agile and smarter data communication infrastructures. Despite the interest it is deserving on a multitude of physical and virtualized infrastructures, currently there are no systematic approaches of characterizing and comparing alternative SDN-based solutions regarding their resilience -- a characteristic of utmost importance on such critical environments. In this paper we present a tentative path to bridge this gap, by proposing a research agenda to advance resilience benchmarks for SDNs. We believe that with such class of tools and methodologies, researchers, developers and practitioners will become in a better position to advance the area and take more informed decisions.","","","","10.1109/ISSREW.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983833","Resilience Assessment;Resilience Benchmarking;Software Defined Networking","Benchmark testing;Context;Control systems;Measurement;Protocols;Resilience;Software defined networking","software defined networking;software reliability;virtualisation","SDN;data communication infrastructures;network control centralization;resilience benchmarking;software defined networking","","0","","28","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High-interaction client honeypots (HICHPs) classify potentially malicious Web pages by driving a dedicated vulnerable Web browser to retrieve and classify these pages. Considering the size of the Internet, the ability to identify many malicious Web pages is a crucial task. HICHPs, however, present challenges: They are slow and tend to miss attacks. For researchers to address these shortcomings, they need methods for evaluating HICHPs. This paper (1) presents an evaluation method called the true positive cost curve (TPCC), which makes it possible to evaluate and compare HICHPs in an operating environment, but also allows an operator to tune HICHPs within a specific operating environment; (2) presents improvements on the way HICHPs visit Web pages and evaluates them with the TPCC method; and (3) discusses the impact of time bombs on the performance of HICHPs in an operating environment and the ability to tune an HICHP for optimal performance with the help of the TPCC.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211044","client honeypot;evaluation;intrusion detection;security","Computer science;Computer security;Cost function;Design engineering;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Weapons;Web pages;Web server","Internet;Web sites;client-server systems;online front-ends;security of data","HICHP;Internet;classification;cost-based evaluation method;dedicated vulnerable Web browser;high-interaction client honeypot;potentially malicious Web page;security device;time bomb;true positive cost curve","","4","","28","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most anomaly based NIDSs employ supervised algorithms, whose performances highly depend on attack-free training data. However, this kind of training data is difficult to obtain in real world network environment. Moreover, with changing network environment or services, patterns of normal traffic will be changed. This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset. The results show that the proposed approach is comparable to previously reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches evaluated over the KDD' 99 dataset.","8164-9547","1-4244-0355-3","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024522","","Access control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Training data","","","","12","","25","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Students should be able to configure and run their own networks, as well as explore the vulnerabilities, exploits, and remediatios needed in a cyber security professional's tool kit. Further, they need exposure to working in the complexity of the Internet. While some might argue that simulation software could be a solution, it often lacks realism. In this paper we show how our institution goes beyond the providing the standard, formalized laboratory activities for our cyber security students by developing a unique, highly configurable testbed called Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment (ISEAGE - pronounced “ice age”) that allows us to imitate the Internet. ISEAGE provides a controlled environment that allows real attacks to be played out against the students' networks and demonstrates to them real world security concepts. This paper provides an overview of how the ISEAGE security testbed functions, as well as illustrates how ISEAGE provides our students five different types of opportunities for real world experience: support of formalized classroom work; cyber defense competitions for high school, community college and four year students; inquiry-based learning in a playground environment for high school, as well as college students; testing environment for network devices such as firewalls, data loss protection, intrusion detection; research environment for senior and graduate student work.","0190-5848","","","10.1109/FIE.2013.6685034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685034","cyber security;information assurance education;laboratory exercises;testbed","Computer security;Computers;Educational institutions;Internet;Servers;Testing","Internet;computational complexity;computer aided instruction;computer science education;digital simulation;security of data","ISEAGE security testbed functions;Internet complexity;Internet-scale event attack and generation environment;circuit design;college students;cyber defense competitions;cyber security professional tool kit;cyber security students;data loss protection;engineering educators;engineering programs;firewalls;formalized classroom work;graduate student work;hardware design;high school students;information assurance;inquiry-based learning;intrusion detection;laboratory exercises;learning experiences;playground environment;simulation software;synthesizing experiences;technology programs","","0","","4","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents results from research into the use of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in detecting specific image file byte patterns in disk clusters.

Based on the information extracted from network flows a model of normal user behavior is discovered with the help of several clustering techniques. This model is then used to detect anomalies within recent time intervals. Since this approach is based on normal user behavior, it can potentially detect zero-day intrusions. Moreover, such a flow-based intrusion detection approach can be used in high speeds since it is based on information in packet headers, and, therefore, has to handle a considerably lesser amount of data. The proposed framework is tested on the data obtained with the help of a realistic cyber environment (RGCE) that enables one to construct real attack vectors. The simulations show that the proposed method results in a higher accuracy rate when compared to other intrusion detection techniques.","","","","10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266510","","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Histograms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Training","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","RGCE;anomalous network flows;intrusion detection approach;normal user behavior;online detection;packet headers;realistic cyber environment;soft clustering;traffic flows;zero-day intrusions","","","","","","","27-29 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Neuro-Fuzzy classifiers are used for the initial classification of the initial network traffic. An inference system, Fuzzy inference systems is further used to determine whether the activity is normal or malicious. Efficient IDS systems are those capable of reducing false positives and generate high rate attack detection. However, fuzzy inference systems use human knowledge to create their fuzzy rule. In order to introduce a more accurate way of classifying network traffic, we introduce the use of Genetic Algorithms in conjunction with ANFIS so as to optimize data classification and obtain the best results.

While the spread of viruses in wired systems has been studied in-depth, applying trust in WSN is an emerging research area. Security threats can be introduced in WSN through various means, such as a benevolent sensor node turning fraudulent after a certain period of time. The proposed research work uses biological inspirations and machine learning techniques for adding security against such threats.

In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event.

Another is the lack of commercial tools to assist in the technique for software. Most SFTA research efforts have been directed at requirements or code. Performing SFTA on the design may enable application of SFTA to critical code only, thus reducing the amount of effort. We attempt to develop a relationship between UML™ design diagrams and fault tree symbology to enable adaptation of a commercial FTA tool to at least one software design language.

In this paper, we propose Predictive Mutual Information (PMI), a hybrid measure of relevance not only is based on MI but also accounts for predictability of signals from one another as in KCCA. We show that PMI has more improved feature detection capability than MI and KCCA, especially in catching suspicious coincidences that are rare but potentially important not only for subsequent experimental studies but also for building computational predictive models which is demonstrated on two toy datasets and a real intrusion detection system dataset.","1051-4651","978-1-4244-7542-1","","10.1109/ICPR.2010.1060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5597870","","Accuracy;Biomedical measurements;Correlation;Entropy;Joints;Kernel;Mutual information","correlation theory;entropy;feature extraction;operating system kernels;security of data;statistical analysis","KCCA;PMI;feature selection algorithm;information entropy;intrusion detection system;kernel canonical correlation analysis;nonlinear correlation measure;predictive mutual information","","1","","9","","","23-26 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the modern intrusion detection systems lack the ability to process massive data streams to achieve anomaly detection. Instead of Intrusion detection, Intrusion prevention system can be used for both servers and end-hosts to handle the dual challenges of accuracy and performance which the former lacks. Intrusion prevention can be done by processing the data stream on fly. It is a difficult issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. Many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items, and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. Our method is employed to prevent the system with high efficiency and low use of system resources.","","978-1-4673-2981-1","","10.1109/CICN.2012.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375255","Data Stream;Frequent Pattern Mining;Intrusion Prevention","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data mining;Data models;Intrusion detection;Servers","data mining;security of data","anomaly intrusion prevention;intrusion detection;massive data streams;network security architecture;online frequent item set mining;time-sensitive sliding window","","0","","12","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET. Simulation results that evaluate our scheme based on the trust management metrics we have defined demonstrate its performance benefits.","1550-445X","978-1-4673-0714-7","","10.1109/AINA.2012.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6184895","Local Broadcast;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Replication;Semantic Aware;Trust Management","Availability;Buffer storage;Jamming;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing","meta data;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET;mobile ad-hoc network;resource conservation;semantics-aware storage;trust management metrics;trust metadata replication","","0","","28","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The high rate of patients infected with type II DM is caused by late diagnosis, therefore, early detection of disease is necessary to classify the detected patients with type II diabetes mellitus, and undetected patients. Moreover, analyzing the determinant and major attributes are highly recommended. In this research is implemented the combined Classification methods between Regression Tree method (CART) and Random Forest (RF) to build the classification model that is used in the early detection of diabetes mellitus type II disease. Those methods are selected based on the characteristics of the dataset used in medical records that consist of complex attributes consisting of several categorical attributes and continuous attributes, besides the advantages of the CART models are easy to implement, and it can explore the structure of complex medical records, while the RF method can handle the problem in accuracy. This research has tested a different number of trees and numbers of candidate attributes splitter. Based on the test results, it shows that the addition of trees and attributes splitter can improve the accuracy and reduce the error rate, with the optimal inputs are 50 numbers of trees and 3 number of attributes splitter with 83,8% average accuracy. The important attribute of early detection of diabetes mellitus type II is heredity, age, and body mass index.","","978-1-4799-6984-5","","10.1109/ICAICTA.2014.7005947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005947","CART;Diabetes Mellitus type II;Random Forest;classification;the early detection of disease;the important attribute","Accuracy;Data models;Diabetes;Diseases;Regression tree analysis;Testing;Vegetation","diseases;electronic health records;patient diagnosis;pattern classification;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","CART models;RF method;candidate attributes splitter;categorical attributes;classification and regression tree method;complex medical record structure;continuous attributes;disease early detection;random forest;type II diabetes Mellitus early detection","","0","","12","","","20-21 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively. The algorithm is independent of specific applications so that many ideas and solutions can be transferred to other classifier paradigms.","","978-1-4244-4786-2","978-1-4244-4787-9","10.1109/ICADVC.2009.5377998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377998","","Application software;Control systems;Energy consumption;Humanoid robots;Hydraulic actuators;Induction motors;Intrusion detection;Legged locomotion;Robot control;Testing","computer network security;data mining;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","computer networks;data mining;databases process;feature selection;information extraction;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor classifier;knowledge discovery;map data classification;supervised learning","","0","","27","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, Intrusion detection systems face a number of challenges. One of the important challenges is that, the input data to be classified is in a high dimension feature space. In this paper, we are trying to present MSPSO-DT intrusion detection system. Where, Multi Swam Particle Swarm Optimization (MSPSO) is used as a feature selection algorithm to maximize the C4.5 Decision Tree classifier detection accuracy and minimize the timing speed.

However, most often, it is after the deployment or implementation phase that specified security requirements may be violated. This may be due to improper deployment of the security measures, environmental hazards or to the fact that the assumptions under which the security requirements have been specified have become invalid. As such, this paper proposes an approach (supported by a system) which will complement security requirements engineering methodologies by gathering continuous evidence to inform on whether the security requirements elucidated during system development stage have been correctly implemented and as such, they can be relied upon to effectively protect system assets at runtime. We use Secure Tropos methodology to highlight the security assurance case and elicit the features of our security assurance evaluation system.

Compromise of concentrators can be detected. The aggregated data is protected using Chameleon Signatures and then forwarded to the utility back-end for verification, accounting, and analysis. Using the Trapdoor Chameleon Hash Function, the smart meters can periodically send an evidence to the utility back-end, by computing an alternative message and a random value (m', r) such that m' consists of all previous energy usage measurements of the smart meter in a specified period of time. By verifying that the Chameleon Hash Value of (m', r) and that the energy usage matches those aggregated by the concentrators, the utility back-end is convinced of the integrity and authenticity of the data from the smart meters. Any data anomaly between smart meters and concentrators can be detected, thus indicating potential compromise of concentrators.","","978-1-4799-8098-7","","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064626","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064626","","Ground penetrating radar;IEEE 802.15 Standards;IP networks;Logic gates;Zigbee","cryptographic protocols;data communication;smart meters;telecommunication security","AMI;advanced metering infrastructure;chameleon signatures;customer billing;delayed-integrity-verification;energy usage measurements;secure end-to-end data aggregation;trapdoor chameleon hash function","","0","","21","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security is a fundamental issue for these service networks due to the relevant business information handled in these networks. In this paper, we design and implement an efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism, called efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network (ELIDV) that aims to protect the network against three kinds of attacks: denial of service (DoS), integrity target, and false alert's generation. ELIDV is based on a set of rules that detects malicious vehicles promptly and with high accuracy. We present the performance analysis of our detection mechanism using NS-3 simulator.

LARIAT allows researchers and operational users to rapidly configure and run real-time intrusion detection and correlation tests with robust background traffic and attacks in their laboratories. Second, “Scenario Datasets” have been crafted to provide examples of multiple component attack scenarios instead of the atomic attacks as found in past evaluations. Third, extensive analysis of the 1999 evaluation data and results has provided understanding of many attacks, their manifestations, and the features used to detect them. This analysis is used to develop models of attacks, intrusion detection systems, and intrusion detection system alerts.

We show how the system is immune to malicious attacks that adjust transmitted signal strengths in attempts to circumvent the intrusion detection algorithms. We compare our results with earlier work that utilized static position information as a means for intrusion detection, showing how verification errors determined via tracking can be an order of magnitude smaller. Contrary to the static case, we also show how position verification via tracking is viable in the case where only one access point is within range of the mobile device.

However, it is currently unknown how likely an IDS is to detect a given Internet-wide scan pattern and whether there exist sufficiently fast scan techniques that can remain virtually undetectable at large-scale. To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

This is due to the ability of active worms to propagate in an automated fashion as they continuously compromise computers on the Internet. Active worms evolve during their propagation, and thus, pose great challenges to defend against them. In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, referred to as Camouflaging Worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm is different from traditional worms because of its ability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time. Thereby, the C-Worm camouflages its propagation from existing worm detection systems based on analyzing the propagation traffic generated by worms. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and nonworm traffic (background traffic). We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain. However, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the Power Spectral Density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from background traffic. Using a comprehensive set of detection metrics and real-world traces as background traffic, we conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed spectrum-based detection scheme. The performance data clearly demonstrates that our scheme can effectively detect the C-Worm propagation. Furthermore, we show the generality of our spectrum-based scheme in effectively detecting not only the C-Worm, but traditional worms as well.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444887","Worm;anomaly detection.;camouflage","Computer networks;Computer worms;Density measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Internet;Large-scale systems;Power measurement;Recruitment;Telecommunication traffic;Volume measurement","Internet;invasive software","C-Worm propagation detection;Internet;active worms;background traffic;camouflaging worm detection;camouflaging worm modeling;nonworm traffic;power spectral density distribution;propagation traffic;security threats;spectral flatness measure;spectrum-based scheme","","7","","65","","2010-04-08","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","0","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, this approach does not scale as the number of endpoints increases, the number of networks grow, and limited skilled human analysts. Current state of the art analytic techniques have been developed to aid the human analyst in the association of sensor alerts to cyber attacks. However, these analytic systems require association decisions to be irrevocably made at the time of association. Our approach is to extend the multiple hypothesis tracking framework, from the standard kinematic domain, to the cyber domain.

The experimental results show that this method can construct the virtual samples which are similar to the real sample characteristics, and improved the classification effect of KNN algorithm.","","978-1-4673-2646-9","","10.1109/ISCID.2012.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6407028","Harmful information filtering;Network information security;Small sample pattern recognition;Virtual sample","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;Information filtering;Support vector machine classification;Training","information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;sampling methods;text analysis","KNN algorithm;KNN categorization algorithm;classification effect;data layer;harmful information filtering;harmful text information;k-means clustering;pattern recognition;up-sampling method","","0","","7","","","28-29 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the pervasiveness of internet, network security has become critical issue in every organization. Network attacks results in massive amount of loss in terms of money, reputation and data confidentiality. Reducing or eliminating the negative effects of any intrusion is a fundamental issue of network security. The network security problem can be represented as a game between the attacker or intruder and the network administrator where both the players try to attain maximum outcome. The network administrator tries to defend the attack and the attacker tries to overcome it and attack the system. Thus network security can be enforced using game theoretic approach. This paper presents a review of game theoretic solutions developed for network security.","","","","10.1109/ICCPCT.2015.7159364","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7159364","Nash equilibrium;attack defence;game theory;network security","Communication networks;Computational modeling;Games;Intrusion detection;Nash equilibrium","Internet;game theory;information technology;security of data;ubiquitous computing","Internet;game-theoretic approach;information technology;network administration;network security;pervasiveness","","0","","20","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed framework uses data mining, especially an Artificial Neural Network, which makes it accurate, fast, and scalable.

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, widespread usage over UDP, limited use of encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level to launch denial of service attacks. To mitigate this, self- learning systems have been proposed to detect anomalous SIP messages and filter them. However, previous works use datasets with large differences between the normal and anomalous message. This gives high performance for existing classification systems, including those based on Euclidean distances. We present our analysis on a new dataset that has minimal difference between normal and anomalous messages. Our findings indicate that existing classification schemes behave unsatisfactorily on our dataset. We demonstrate why this is the case by statistical analysis of our dataset, and furthermore, present feature reduction techniques to enhance the classification performance of existing classification schemes on our dataset.","2157-4952","978-1-4244-8705-9","978-1-4244-8703-5","10.1109/NTMS.2011.5720662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720662","","Computer crime;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms","Internet;cryptographic protocols;message authentication;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;statistical analysis","Euclidean distance;Internet;anomalous message;anomaly detection;classification system;encryption;feature reduction technique;multimedia session establishment protocol;self learning system;session initiation protocol;statistical analysis","","8","","20","","","7-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The obfuscation was performed by tunneling the malicious traffic in HTTP and HTTPS protocols with the intention of simulating the usual legitimate characteristics of the HTTP traffic's flow. The buffer overflow vulnerabilities of four services were used: Samba, BadBlue, Apache, DCOM RPC. Exploitation was performed in a virtual network environment by using scenarios simulating real traffic's conditions as well as legitimate traffic simulations which were performed. Captured data were examined by SNORT and by ASNM network features of the AIPS representing statistically and behaviorally based NBA. The achieved results show an obfuscated attacks transparency for SNORT detection and low detection performance of the AIPS trained by direct attacks and legitimate traffic only in contrast with high classification accuracy of the AIPS trained with an inclusion of obfuscated attacks. Data mining analysis was performed by using both bi-nominal and poly-nominal classifications, resulting into better performance of poly-nominal classification. At the summary, we emphasize the necessity of training the statistically and behaviorally based NBAs with divergent obfuscation techniques to strengthen their detection capabilities.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2014.7038827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038827","IDS;NBA;buffer overflow;network vulnerabilities;protocol tunneling;traffic obfuscation","Buffer overflows;Data mining;Feature extraction;Internet;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;data mining;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","AIPS;ASNM network features;Apache;BadBlue;DCOM RPC;HTTP protocols;HTTP secure protocol;HTTPS protocols;HTTPS traffic;IDS;NBA;SNORT detection;SNORT network features;Samba;advanced security network metrics;automated intrusion prevention system;binominal classification;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;classification accuracy;data mining analysis;hyper text transfer protocol;legitimate traffic simulations;obfuscated network buffer overflow attacks detection properties;obfuscated network vulnerability exploitation;polynominal classification;virtual network environment","","0","","30","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The WNN was trained by MQPSO. A multidimensional vector composed of WNN parameters was regarded as a particle in learning algorithm. The parameter vector, which has a best adaptation value, was searched globally. The well-known KDD Cup 1999 Intrusion Detection Data Set was used as the experimental data. Experimental result on KDD 99 intrusion detection datasets shows that this learning algorithm has more rapid convergence, better global convergence ability compared with the traditional quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO), and the accuracy of anomaly detection is enhanced. It also shows the remarkable ability of this novel algorithm to detect new type of attacks.","","978-1-4244-3692-7","978-1-4244-3693-4","10.1109/WICOM.2009.5302833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302833","","Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Function approximation;Genetic algorithms;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Particle swarm optimization;Wavelet analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;radial basis function networks;security of data","KDD Cup 1999;MQPSO;intrusion detection data set;learning algorithm;modified quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm;multidimensional vector;network anomaly detection;wavelet neural network","","1","","15","","","24-26 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, ISPs over-provision capacity in order to meet QoS demands from customers. Software-Defined Networking and OpenFlow allow for better network control and flexibility in the pursuit of operating networks as efficiently as possible. Where OpenFlow provides interfaces to implement fine-grained Traffic Engineering (TE), OpenNetMon provides the monitoring necessary to determine whether end-to-end QoS parameters are actually met and delivers the input for TE approaches to compute appropriate paths. OpenNetMon polls edge switches, i.e. switches with flow end-points attached, at an adaptive rate that increases when flow rates differ between samples and decreases when flows stabilize to minimize the number of queries. The adaptive rate reduces network and switch CPU overhead while optimizing measurement accuracy. We show that not only local links serving variable bit-rate video streams, but also aggregated WAN links benefit from an adaptive polling rate to obtain accurate measurements. Furthermore, we verify throughput, delay and packet loss measurements for bursty scenarios in our experiment testbed.","","","","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838228","","Bandwidth;Control systems;Delays;Monitoring;Packet loss;Throughput","computer network performance evaluation;software radio","OpenFlow software-defined networks;OpenNetMon:;QoS parameters;aggregated WAN links;fine-grained traffic engineering;network monitoring;variable bit-rate video stream","","12","","21","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The self patterns could be any variety of characteristics of a system or its users. Detectors of an AIS recognize non-self patterns and invoke an alarm. In this work, an AIS was used to monitor simulated TCP/IP traffic on a simulated broadcast local area network.

Computers are integral part of everyday operations. Organizations depend on them. A computer failure will have a critical impact on the organization. The term “Security” brings to mind all shorts of issues that refer to data protection and prevention of unauthorised access. The common motives for computer crimes could be lure for money, revenge, terrorism, fun, recognition or curiosity. Information systems can be attacked by outsiders who may penetrate a computer system or by insiders who are authorised to use the resources but misuse their authorization. An attacker may disrupt the information system of an organization (active attack) or gain access to its sensitive information (passive attack). Although no direct damage is done in a passive attack, any leak in information could have drastic repercussions for the organization. In simple words, security can be defined as: protecting information system from intended access. The goal of network management is to provide users with a quality of service. To meet this goal, network services plan involve strategic and technical planning of engineering, operations and maintenance of the network. The field of network security and management is constantly undergoing changes in technology, applications and hence the need for continually changing skills set on the part of academics. We will try to cover the various points with respect to organizational structure, policies and techniques of network security and management. Impact of various factors including management has been discussed on network security.","","978-1-4244-5965-0","978-1-4244-5967-4","10.1109/ICCIC.2010.5705886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705886","","","authorisation;computer crime;computer network management;computer network security;information retrieval;information systems;strategic planning;telecommunication network planning","computer crimes;data protection;information access;information system security;network maintenance;network management;network security;network service plan;quality of service;strategic planning;technical planning;unauthorised access","","0","","","","","28-29 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
