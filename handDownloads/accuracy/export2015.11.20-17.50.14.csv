The cause of this is related to the large number of new vulnerabilities and architectural weaknesses introduced by the extensive use of ICT and networking technologies for the operation and monitoring of such complex systems. Several scientific works, have showed how supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), i.e. the systems which control industrial installations, are exposed to cyber attacks. These, due to the intrinsic nature of SCADA systems, cannot be avoided by using traditional ICT security measures.

On the surface, this should greatly reduce the chances of successfully executing the type of coordinated and distributed cyber attacks necessary to cause large-scale failures. However, existing communications security schemes in power control systems only consider explicit communications. In this paper, we show that there is a rich set of covert communication channels available to attackers for use in coordinating large scale attacks against power grids. Specifically, we present PhyCo, a novel covert channel that leverages physical substrates, e.g., line loads, within a power system, to transmit information between compromised device controllers. Using PhyCo, two compromised controllers that are miles apart can coordinate their efforts by manipulating relays to modify the power network's topology. This can be done without requiring the use of any explicit communication channels, e.g., power line communications, and can evade intrusion detection sensors aimed at overt traffic. We have evaluated PhyCo using real-world programmable logic controllers on a realistic simulated power grid. Our results show that PhyCo can bypass existing intrusion detection sensors as well as physical inspections by carefully crafting covert communications to have minimal exterior consequences within normal operating thresholds.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007771","","Equations;Mathematical model;Power grids;Power measurement;Receivers;Sensors","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;programmable controllers","PhyCo;coordinated cyber attacks;covert channel communication;cyberphysical infrastructures;device controller;distributed cyber attacks;electric power systems;physical interdependencies;power grid;power network topology;programmable logic controller","","0","","24","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations. We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in identifying a wide range of anomalies.

It is considered as a major deficiency while handling heterogeneous and nonstationary data stream to uncover anomaly in the online operational mode. This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area. The performance evaluation confirms that, the proposed method is able to operate in offline as well online modes efficiently. Moreover, constructed connections are very adequate for training and evaluating IDS models.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750267","data aggregation;intrusion detection;performance monitoring;real-time systems","Correlation;Cryptography;Measurement;Receivers;Silicon","data handling;security of data","DARPA dump data flow;IDS;data stream handling;dynamic window size;heterogeneous data stream;intrusion detection systems;massive data flow conversion;network security;nonstationary data stream;queuing concept;simulated network;time slot windows;university campus","","0","","33","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection-based mechanisms are considered to be the second defense line against attacks when the traditional prevention based mechanisms failed to detect them. Different intrusion detection schemes have been introduced (e.g. rule based, statistical based...etc). Rule-based intrusion detection schemes are considered to be the fast and simple schemes that are suitable for the demand of WSN. However, these schemes are more specific to some kinds of attacks and cannot be generalized. In addition, these schemes cannot detect the unknown attacks that are not included in their rule base.

Its design rationale is that web bots behave intrinsically differently from human beings, allowing them to be detected. This paper escalates the battle against web bots by exploring the limits of current HOP-based bot detection systems. We develop an evasive web bot system based on human behavioral patterns. Then we prototype a general web bot framework and a set of flexible de-classifier plugins, primarily based on application-level event evasion. We further abstract and define a set of benchmarks for measuring our system's evasion performance on contemporary web applications, including social network sites.

The Weighted Ensemble model first trains base classifiers using different data classification algorithms (i.e., decision tree, SVMs, and Naive Bayes) on multiple successive data chunks, and then weights each base classifier according to its prediction accuracy on the up-to-date data.

"A Control Theoretical Approach for Flow Control to Mitigate Bandwidth Attacks","Song, Sui; Manikopoulos, C.N.","","Information Assurance Workshop, 2006 IEEE","20060710","2006","","","348","360","Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. However, current intrusion detection is unreliable and may have high false-positives. Rate-limiting is a better-suited response than complete filtering. Filtering out all the traffic to the victim would greatly damage misclassified flows, whereas rate-limiting still allows some packets to reach the destination and thus keeps connection alive. Allowing some attack packets through is acceptable, since the attack's overall impact depends on the volume of the attack packets. Moreover, if the flow-rate of low-priority is reduced, the high-priority flow would get more chances to access the server they share, which eventually reduce the congestion and improve the throughput of the high-priority flow. Based on tie concept of flow aggregation management architecture (Sui Song, et al., April 2006), we present a flow-based congestion control (FCC) architecture that consists of a flow-based quality-of-service (FQoS) regulator and PID controller. The whole system adopts a control-theoretic approach to adjust the traffic rate of every link (or server) so as to maintain the traffic rates at their desired level. In order to provide more fine-grained differentiated services (or flows) with different weight and maximally limit malicious services (or flows), we propose multilevel packet classification structure. Moreover, in order maximally to block flooding, the flow-based network intrusion detection (Sui Song, et al., April 2006) is used to classify each flow in the network into different priority classes and give different treatment to the flow-rates belonging to different classes. The architecture is shown to be highly flexible service differentiation and robust against different types of flooding attacks, and traditional network traffic control can be implemented using one common framework. This system has been evaluated by using simulated test-bed data. Res- - ults showed the success that the system mitigates bandwidth flooding attacks","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652116","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;File servers;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Quality management;Stability;Throughput","Internet;quality of service;security of data;stability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;three-term control","Internet;PID control;bandwidth attacks;flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attack;flow control;flow-based congestion control;flow-based quality-of-service;intrusion detection;multilevel packet classification;rate-limiting;stability","","0","","41","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, WSNs are susceptible to several types of security attacks. One reason to attack sensor networks is the limited capacity of sensor nodes. The security attacks could affect the most significant applications in WSNs area such as military surveillance, traffic monitor, and healthcare. Thus, there are different types of detection approaches against security attacks on the network layer in WSNs. Also, there are severe constraints on sensor nodes like reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability, which affect the security in WSNs. Since the sensor nodes have limited capabilities for most of these constraints, a selective forwarding attack is difficult to detect in the networks. Malicious nodes in the selective forwarding attack, work as normal nodes. However, it attempts to find the sensitive messages and drop them before sending the packet to other nodes. In order to keep this type of attacks away from networks, we propose a multi layers approach (SFD) that preserves the safely of data transmission between sensor nodes while detecting the selective forwarding attack. Furthermore, the approach includes reliability, energy efficiency, and scalability.","","","","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160207","Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Selective Forwarding Attacks","Base stations;Computer science;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Watermarking;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SFD;WSN;data transmission;security attacks;selective forwarding detection;wireless sensor networks","","0","","11","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Masquerade attacks are serious in nature due to the fact that they are mostly carried by insiders and thus are extremely difficult to detect. Detection of these attacks is done by monitoring significant changes in user's behavior based on his/her profile. Currently, such profiles are based mostly on the user command line data and do not represent his/her complete behavior in a graphical user interface (GUI) based system and hence are not sufficient to quickly detect such masquerade attacks. In this paper, we present a new framework for creating a unique feature set for user behavior on GUI based systems. We have collected real user behavior data from live systems and extracted parameters to construct these feature vectors. These vectors contain user information such as mouse speed, distance, angles and amount of clicks during a user session. We model our technique of user identification and masquerade detection as a binary classification problem and use support vector machine (SVM) to learn and classify these feature vectors. We show that our technique can provide detection rates of up to 96% with few false positives based on these feature vectors. We have tested our technique with various feature vector parameters and conclude that these feature vectors can provide unique and comprehensive user behavior information and are powerful enough to detect masqueraders","","1-4244-0130-5","","10.1109/IAW.2006.1652076","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1652076","","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Mice;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","graphical user interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","GUI based systems;computer system illegitimate activity;graphical user interface;impersonation attack;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;support vector machine;user identification","","5","","34","","","21-23 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a game theory method to analyze the risk and impact of multi-stage attacks in IDS. In this method, the interactions between the attacker and the administrator are modeled as a non-cooperative zero-sum multistage game and it is modeled as a minmax game tree where the attacker is the leader and the administrator is the follower. Alternating the actions between the administrator and the attacker forms the game tree, each of them will be allowed to play a single action at any given time. In this work, a new multi-stage attacker defender (MAD) algorithm is developed to help the administrator in defending against multi-stage attacks.

The neuro-architecture of the proposed system provides not only systempsilas capability of detecting attacks that are not included in the training sets, but also fast decision due to the natural parallelism propriety of the neural networks. Also, the software implementation of the proposed system is explained. Furthermore, an FPGA-based implementation of the system is illustrated to provide an extra enhancement of system speed. Besides, the FPGA-based implementation provides an improved scope of boosting security over the software-based system.","","978-1-4244-2115-2","978-1-4244-2116-9","10.1109/ICCES.2008.4773010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4773010","FPGA;IDS;MLP;Network security","Communication system security;Computer architecture;Consumer electronics;Databases;Field programmable gate arrays;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Protection","field programmable gate arrays;neural net architecture;security of data","FPGA-based neuro-architecture intrusion detection system;network security system;neuro-architecture;software implementation","","1","","16","","","25-27 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extensive research activities have been aimed at network-based intrusion detection systems, but most of them are proved unsatisfactory. This paper presents an effective intrusion detection classification model based on projection pursuit. With maximizing a projection index, Projection Pursuit uses Genetic Algorithm to search for the optimal projection direction, projects network connections records from high-dimensional space into 1-dimensional space, and uses the projection values to analyze the data structure and classify the type of intrusion. This intrusion detection classification model not only cuts down the computing complexity in the process of network connection records, but also opens out non-linear structure not like in latent semantics analysis only discovering linear structure, and the results of classification can also be visualized. The results of the experiments on KDD CUP 1999 data show that this model not only has good performance, but also reduces the number of false alarms effectively.","","978-1-4577-1414-6","","10.1109/CECNet.2012.6201446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6201446","clustering;dimension reduction;intrusion detection;projection pursuit","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Testing;Training","computational complexity;computer network security;data structures;genetic algorithms;pattern classification","KDD CUP 1999 data;computational complexity;data structure;false alarms;genetic algorithm;high-dimensional space;intrusion detection classification model;latent semantics analysis;linear structure;network connections records;network security;network-based intrusion detection systems;nonlinear structure;one-dimensional space;optimal projection direction search;projection index maximization;projection pursuit","","0","","9","","","21-23 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there is a weak anomaly detection problem among the existing system call based intrusion detection systems: the pattern value range of abnormal system call sequences generated by attacks always overlaps to that by normal behaviors so it is difficult to accurately classify the sequences falling into the overlap area by a unique threshold. Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.","","978-1-4799-2763-0","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743958","Intrusion Detection;Multi-module System;Top-k Prediction;Viterbi Algorithm","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","computer network security;pattern classification","TkVV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;abnormal system call sequences;computer networks;multimodule anomaly detection system;scalable linear algorithm;sequence classification;system call based intrusion detection systems;system protection;top-k future system call prediction;top-k prediction based multimodule;top-k variation","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with the traditional methods, the model designed here, which is totally insensitive to port numbers and contents of payload on application level, overcomes difficulty in operation caused by unreliable port numbers and complexity of payload interpretation. Rather than relatively complex ML algorithms or even in mixture, supervised k-Nearest Neighbor estimator is adopted for the sake of computational efficiency, along with the effective and easy-to-calculate statistical features selected according to the operational background.

By allowing benchmarks to draw from a corpus of installable modules which can be based on actual security vulnerabilities, members of the security community can continuously maintain and improve the benchmark, allowing it to be updated as threats and defenses evolve. We developed a prototype of this testbed and determined that the testbed should automate several common web testing tasks on behalf of its modules in order to ease module development.

Many solutions have been proposed to secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection systems with many different techniques such as data mining approaches are employed to maximize the detection rate of intrusions while reducing false alarm rate. For instance, many clustering techniques are recommended which segregate normal and abnormal data in IDSs. Clustering methods put emphasis on finding differences and similarities of traffic sessions to categorize each one in its corresponding groups. These groups are represented by their assigned labels. Later, these labels are used to predict the type of the incoming network traffic. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to use in intrusion detection systems, named CluSID. The major contribution of CluSID is using information theory for taking full advantages of clustering techniques. The main logic behind CluSID is to use non-uniform gain functions for network traffic features in order to improve the accuracy of clustering process. To this end, we apply information theory concepts for moving center of clusters to the most important areas in the domain of the selected features. The results clearly show a raise in detection rate of CluSID in most of the attack categories in comparison to KDD CUP'99 Winner and simple clustering methods. The increase in detection rate of proposed system is about 25 percent.","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635546","Clustering;Entropy;Information Theory;Intrusion Detecfion System","Clustering methods;Communication system security;Data mining;Data security;IP networks;Information security;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Logic;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data","Internet;clustering scheme;data mining;information theory;intrusion detection system;network traffic","","1","","19","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A proactive security defense such as intrusion detection system has become a recent research topic in this area. Many intrusion detection models are proposed by the researchers and most of them are promising. How-ever, the problem in mobile ad-hoc environment is that communication and power resources are very limited. Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible. This paper presents a comparison study between the co-operative detection model and the aggregative detection model to evaluate the efficiency of resource usage. We use a sample case study of disaster recovery operations system to have a real scenario of mobile ad-hoc practice. An experiment is conducted using that scenario under different treatments. The contribution of our work is to suggest an intrusion detection model that is efficient but still reliable to use.","","978-1-4673-4527-9","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514283","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Power demand","computer network security;costing;mobile ad hoc networks;resource allocation","aggregative detection model;communication resource usage efficiency evaluation;cooperative detection model;disaster recovery operations system;intrusion detection system cost performance analysis;mobile wireless ad-hoc network;network security;power resource usage efficiency evaluation;wireless communication settings","","1","","14","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, we focus on intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) to defend against the intruders. In this paper, we propose a Distributed, Collaborative, and Data-driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (DCDIDP). Its goal is to make use of the resources in the cloud and provide a holistic IDPS for all cloud service providers which collaborate with other peers in a distributed manner at different architectural levels to respond to attacks. We present the DCDIDP framework, whose infrastructure level is composed of three logical layers: network, host, and global as well as platform and software levels. Then, we review its components and discuss some existing approaches to be used for the modules in our proposed framework.

By doing this, the complex defense system cannot detect the attack traffic in time. In this paper, we propose a behavior based detection that can discriminate DDoS attack traffic from traffic generated by real users. By using Pearson's correlation coefficient, our comparable detection methods can extract the repeatable features of the packet arrivals. The extensive simulations were tested for the accuracy of detection. We then performed experiments with several datasets and our results affirm that the proposed method can differentiate traffic of an attack source from legitimate traffic with a quick response.

Filtering malicious traffic can be integrated with firewall hardware or software. Firecol act as an intrusion prevention system which prevent the network attack using IPS rules. This form a virtual mitigation shield around the network by clusters of IPS system. The above mentioned attack can be detected using honeypot, an IDS(intrusion detection system).

Web applications have many vulnerabilities such as Injection, Broken Authentication and Session Management, and Cross-site scripting (XSS). Subsequently, web applications have become targets of hackers, and a lot of cyber attack began to emerge in order to block the services of these Web applications (Denial of Service Attach). Developers are not aware of these vulnerabilities and have no enough time to secure their applications. Therefore, there is a significant need to study and improve attack detection for web applications through determining the most significant factors for detection. To the best of our knowledge, there is not any research that summarizes the influent factors of detection web attacks.

In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study.

Furthermore, we introduce non-parametric methods, which require no training and are more adaptive to mobile scenarios. The proposed detection schemes are implemented and evaluated using a 48-node testbed and a mobile ad-hoc network emulator at the Army Research Lab.

Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources. In this paper, we provide evidence through simulation experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET intrusion detection system (IDS). We also discuss on how the similar friendship concept could be used to address several challenges faced in MANET environment.","","978-0-7695-3324-7","","10.1109/IAS.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627093","Friend Mechanisms;MANET;Small World","Ad hoc networks;Centralized control;Communication system control;Data communication;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Quality of service;Waste materials","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;quality of service;telecommunication network routing","MANET;QoS;autoconfiguration methods;autonomous environment;battery power;data transmission process;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;resource degradation;resource management","","4","","15","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work uses a neural network to recognize users by keystroke dynamics and draws a comparison among several training algorithms: single backpropagation, three approaches based on genetic algorithms and three approaches based on immune algorithms.","","978-1-4673-1510-4","978-1-4673-1508-1","10.1109/CEC.2012.6252928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252928","","Backpropagation;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Neural networks;Training","authorisation;backpropagation;behavioural sciences;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;neural nets;user interfaces","anomalous user behavior identification;behavioral intrusion detection;digital identities;evolutionary neural networks;feature extraction;genetic algorithm;identity theft;immune algorithm;keystroke dynamic recognition;single backpropagation;training algorithm;user typing rhythm","","2","","32","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Switching across processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints.

This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario. Virtual hosts were automatically configured with unique emulated network stack behaviors for 92% of the targeted devices.

Thus the optimization power of Genetic Algorithm has been applied to select a small number of significant fuzzy rules for a compact classification system applied to multivariate dataset classification. The hybrid algorithm is used here to predict cellular localization sites of proteins in yeast. Two different fitness measures were taken to evaluate the rules generated by the algorithm during evolution process. Than the performance of Fuzzy Genetic algorithm with better fitness measure is compared to the performance of Naïve Bayesian approach to accurately detect and classify patterns. The performance analysis includes testing on train as well as test dataset, created from original dataset.

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on ""traditional"" graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781","","Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic","","1","","21","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The human labeling of the available network audit data instances is usually tedious, time consuming and expensive.

DFM is scalable and simple to implement, it is capable of tracing thousands of simultaneous distributed attacks in near real time. Moreover, it has a small footprint, resulting in low processing and memory overhead at the victim machines and edge routers.

This gives the system administrator or an autonomic system ample time to take corrective action.","","978-1-4799-7411-5","","10.1109/EMS.2014.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154055","cloud computing; security; privacy; intrusion detection systems; intrusion prediction; variable order markov model; probabilistic suffix tree","Computational modeling;Context modeling;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Training","Markov processes;cloud computing;probability;quality of service;risk management;security of data;software fault tolerance;trees (mathematics)","DARPA 2000 dataset;LLDDoS1.0 attack;LLDDoS2.0;QoS requirements;autonomic system;cloud computing paradigm;cloud infrastructures;cloud systems;finite context intrusion prediction model;overall risk evaluation;probabilistic suffix tree;quality-of-service requirements;risk assessment model;variable order Markov model","","1","","15","","","21-23 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711","978-1-4577-2027-7","978-1-4577-2026-0","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","1","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Payload-based approaches are effective to known DOS attacks but are unable to be deployed on high-speed networks. To address this issue, flow-based DOS detection schemes have been proposed for highspeed networks as an effective supplement of payload-based solutions. However, existing flow-based solutions have serious limitations in detecting unknown attacks and efficiently identifying real attack flows buried in the background traffic. In addition, existing solutions also have difficulty to adapt to attack dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a flow-based DOS detection scheme based on Artificial Immune systems. We adopt a tree structure to store flow information such that we can effectively extract useful features from flow information for better detecting DoS attacks. We employ Neighborhood Negative Selection (NNS) as the detection algorithm to detect unknown DoS attacks, and identify attack flows from massive traffic. Because the strong tolerance of NNS, the proposed solution is able to quickly adapt attack dynamics. The experimental results show that this solution is able to effectively detect unknown DoS attack flows and identify attack flows from background traffic. Meanwhile, the theoretical analysis demonstrates that this system can extract flow features more effectively.","","978-1-4673-1855-6","","10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664254","Artificial immune;DoS attack;Flow;Intrusion detection","Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Data mining;Detectors;Feature extraction;IP networks;Protocols","Internet;artificial immune systems;computer network security;real-time systems;telecommunication traffic","DoS attack flows;DoS attacks;Internet;NNS;artificial immune systems;attack dynamics;background traffic;detection algorithm;flow information;flow-based DOS detection schemes;flow-based solutions;high-speed networks;neighborhood negative selection;payload-based approaches;payload-based solutions;real attack flows;tree structure","","0","","14","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, it eliminates unnecessary signature matching in order to enhance the detection capabilities for the NIDS. This paper assesses the effectiveness of depending only on vulnerability scanners to perform signature customization. In addition, it introduces the integration of vulnerability scanners with patch management tools to limit the number of false positive and false negative customizations. The results show that adding the patch management tools to the integration between the NIDS and vulnerability scanners can reduce the false signature customization. The proposed system will insure tuning accuracy for average of 30% of all shielded rules in the original signature customization system, accordingly improving the overall detection efficiency for the IDS.","","978-1-4799-3187-3","","10.1109/ITNG.2014.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822251","NIDS;Snort;Vulnerability assessment;WSUS;risk assessment","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Computers;Intrusion detection;NIST;Software","computer network security;digital signatures","NIDS;false negative customizations;false positive customizations;intrusion detection system;network based IDS;patch management tools;signature customization system;signature matching;vulnerability scanners","","0","","12","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper examines a large set of security incident data using tools from the software reliability community. We look at applying Non-Homogenous Poisson Process (NHPP) models as a method for describing the reliability growth process. We examine the full set of incidents as well as subsets of the data based on incident types. We look at using the Laplace test to guide selection of the appropriate models. Then, based on the trend results, we apply various NHPP models (i.e., Goel-Okumutu, S-Shaped, Duane, and K-Stage Curve) to illustrate the relevance of using these models to fit the incident data and to predict future incidents.","1071-9458","978-0-7695-3024-6","","10.1109/ISSRE.2007.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4402207","","Computer network reliability;Computer security;Context modeling;Data security;Helium;Information security;Predictive models;Reliability engineering;Software reliability;Testing","security of data;software reliability","computer security incidents;consumer confidence;data theft;network security incidents;nonhomogenous Poisson process;reliability growth process;reputational damage;software reliability;stock prices","","3","","15","","","5-9 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool to protect computer networks from attacks. Traditional packet-based NIDSs are time-intensive as they analyze all network packets. A state-of-the-art NIDS should be able to handle a high volume of traffic in real time. Flow-based intrusion detection is an effective method for high speed networks since it inspects only packet headers. The existence of new attacks in the future is another challenge for intrusion detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection is a well-known method capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose a flow-based anomaly detection system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important approach for anomaly detection. We used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with one hidden layer. We investigate the use of a Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) in optimizing interconnection weights of a MLP network. Our proposed GSA-based flow anomaly detection system (GFADS) is trained with a flow-based data set. The trained system can classify benign and malicious flows with 99.43% accuracy. We compare the performance of GSA with traditional gradient descent training algorithms and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results show that GFADS is effective in flow-based anomaly detection. Finally, we propose a four-feature subset as the optimal set of features.","","978-1-4799-3247-4","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2013.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679866","Flow-based anomaly detection;Gravitational Search algorithm;Multi-layer Perceptron","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","multilayer perceptrons;search problems;security of data","ANN;GFADS;GSA algorithm;GSA-based flow anomaly detection system;MLP network;anomaly-based intrusion detection;artificial neural network;benign flow classification;flow-based anomaly detection;flow-based intrusion detection;gravitational search algorithm;high speed networks;malicious flow classification;multilayer perceptron neural network","","1","","20","","","8-11 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
