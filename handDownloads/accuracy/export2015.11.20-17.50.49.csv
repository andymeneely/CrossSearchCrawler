This paper mainly focuses on reducing the problem of false alarm rate, using semantic based system call patterns. Here, we make use of the semantic approach to apply on the underlying kernel level system calls which can help understand the anomaly behavior. The semantic tool used is the data dictionary. The data dictionary containing every possible combinations of sequence of system call names of particular phrase length was constructed. The features satisfying the semantic hypothesis are extracted and then normalized. The normalized values are then given as input to the decision engine.

The new method is based on the inherent feature of the TCP protocol, that is, two communicating peers keep synchronized with each other using data acknowledgment. This feature is converted as a balance mechanism in interactive TCP traffic replay and incorporated into the current state-based method. In this way, the cost of state-checking can be significantly reduced and the replay performance is thus enhanced. To validate the effectiveness of the method we implement it by building an interactive replay system. The experimental results indicate that: 1) balance-checking reduces the overhead of state-checking by 40%; 2) the balance-based method enhances the overall replay performance by an average of 5% when the actual TCP traffic traces are replayed.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501960","","Communication system traffic control;Communications Society;Costs;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","","","","1","","17","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection and decision process in an anomaly based IDS.","","978-0-7695-3258-5","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606112","Anomaly detection;Bayesian networks;Intrusion detection","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Electronic commerce;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;security of data","anomaly detection model;decision process;false alarms;incorrect event classification;intrusion detection system;two stratum Bayesian network","","1","","22","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance.

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts: source code, and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities. We framed our study using Situation Awareness-a cognitive theory from psychology-to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis. We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive, comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications, in addition, to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications.

The wide spread deployment of WLAN has also brought new challenges to security and privacy. Anomaly detection is fast becoming a key element of intrusion detection systems, in which perturbations from normal behavior suggest the presence of intentionally or unintentionally induced attacks, faults, defects, etc. Accurately detecting such anomalies has become an important problem for the network community. We need to distinguish anomalies that change the traffic either abruptly or slowly. While a good amount of research has been done for fixed wired networks, not much research has been done in this area for wireless networks due to lack of a good data set. Hence we developed a discrimination algorithm using correlation coefficient to detect anomalies in the Wireless traffic and demonstrated the effectiveness.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726547","Anomaly detection;Correlation Coefficient;Discrimination Algorithm;Security;Wireless LAN","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","computer network security;data privacy;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;anomaly detection;correlation coefficient;discrimination algorithm;intrusion detection systems;network community;privacy;security;wireless local area network;wireless traffic","","1","","5","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has potential application to reducing human-animal conflicts in the vicinity of a wildlife park. The system takes on the form of a sensor-tower platform (STP) and was developed in-house. It employs a sensor array that endows the platform with a spatial-resolution capability. Given the difficulty of collecting data involving animal motion, a simulation tool was created with the aid of Blender and OpenGL software that is capable of quickly generating streams of human and animal-intrusion data. The generated data was then examined to identify a suitable collection of features that are useful in classification. The features selected corresponded to parameters that model the received signal as the super-imposition of a fixed number of chirplets, an energy signature and a cross-correlation parameter. The resultant feature vector was then passed on to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. This approach to classification was validated by making use of real-world data collected by the STP which showed both STP design as well as classification technique employed to be quite effective. The average classification accuracy with both real and simulated data was in excess of 94%.","","978-1-4799-8054-3","","10.1109/ISSNIP.2015.7106914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106914","Wireless sensor network;animation;chirplets;intrusion detection;passive infrared sensor;sensor array","Animals;Arrays;Chirp;Clutter;Sensors","computer animation;feature extraction;forestry;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;support vector machines","Blender and OpenGL software;PIR sensing based intrusion detection system;STP design;SVM;animal intrusions;animation-and-chirplet based approach;cross-correlation parameter;energy signature;feature vector;human intrusions;human-animal conflicts;intruder classification;passive infrared sensing based intrusion detection system;sensor-tower platform;spatial-resolution capability;support vector machine;vegetative clutter;wildlife park","","0","","13","","","7-9 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analogous to traffic normalization for network intrusion detection systems, the proposed RouteNormalizer patches ambiguities and eliminates semantically incorrect routing updates to protect against routing protocol attacks. Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implementation based on empirical BGP routing updates. We validate its effectiveness by showing that many well-known routing problems from operator mailing lists are correctly identified.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272952","","Frequency;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Routing protocols;Spine;Stress;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","BGP routing;RouteNormaIizer;TCP proxy;firewall;local network;network intrusion detection systems;resource-based attacks;routers;routing misbehavior;routing protocol attacks;traffic normalization","","0","","47","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although traditional detection methodologies employing signature and anomaly based systems have had reasonable success, new class of spyware programs emerge which blend in with user activities to avoid detection. One of the latest anti-spyware technologies consists of a local agent that generates honeytokens of known parameters (e.g., network access requests) and tricks spyware into assuming it to be legitimate activity. In this paper, as a first step, we address the deficiencies of static honeytoken generation and present an attack that circumvents such detection techniques. We synthesize the attack by means of data mining algorithms like associative rule mining. Next, we present a randomized honeytoken generation mechanism to address this new class of spyware. Experimental results show that (i) static honeytokens are detected with near 100% accuracy, thereby defeating the state-of-the-art anti-spyware technique, (ii) randomized honeytoken generation mechanism is an effective anti-spyware solution.","1097-2641","1-4244-1138-6","1-4244-1138-6","10.1109/PCCC.2007.358933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197969","Associative Rule Mining;Honeytokens;Spyware;User Activity","Computer science;Data analysis;Data mining;History;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Network synthesis;Privacy;Security","data mining;invasive software","SpyCon;anti-spyware technologies consists;associative rule mining;data mining algorithms;evasive spyware detection;randomized honeytoken generation mechanism;static honeytoken generation","","1","5","27","","","11-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed mechanism is based on Jensen-Shannon divergence metric over sketch data structure. This sketch is used to reduce the required memory, while monitoring the traffic, by maintaining them into a predefined fixed size of hash tables. This sketch is also used to develop a probabilistic model. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used for detecting deviations between previously established and current distributions of network traffic. We have implemented our approach and evaluated it using real Internet traffic traces, obtained from MAWI trans-Pacific wide transit link between USA and Japan.

Therefore, we propose a new scheme that applies health care within wireless sensor networks in which sensor nodes can measure the vital signs of the aged people and the patients. The vital signs for blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature measured by sensor nodes would be transmitted to mobile devices of medical staff and system administrator. Sensor node readings enable the medical staff to understand the conditions of the patients in real time which improves the quality of health care for the patients. According to the personal data protection act, the vital signs of the patients can only be accessed by the authorized medical staff. In order to protect the privacy of patients, the administrator will verify the identity of medical staff through the mobile device with smart card and password. Accordingly, only the verified medical staff can obtain the vital signs such as blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature of the patients. Besides, the scheme includes a characteristic of time-bounded, and then the medical staffs can obtain the vital signs without re-authenticating and re-login into the system in a period of time.

One of the major sophisticated threats that happen to be very difficult and challenging to counter due to its distributed nature and resulted in cloud service disruption is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Even though there are number of intrusion detection solutions proposed by different research groups, and cloud service providers (CSP) are currently using different detection solutions by promising that their product is well secured, there is no such a perfect solution that prevents the DDoS attack. The characteristics of DDoS attack, i.e., Having different appearance with different scenarios, make it difficult to detect.

By this method, it will be possible to increase effective ICMP traceback messages which can provide useful information to the victim in tracing source of attack. Reconstructed path to the source of attack by the victim can be done accurately when more effective ICMP traceback messages are generated in critical routers.

After gaining network data package and pattern matching according to the protocol analysis result of primary data, the attack behavior is detected, and the signature database is unceasingly updated by new attack behavior signature. The SSL encryption authentication is used in data package transmission, which can prevent the information leakage and falsifying, and the data remain original.

Thus we cluster the randomly deployed nodes to decrease the hop count along the synchronization path.

To detect or measure emergence we observe the system and extract characteristic attributes from those observations. As an extension of earlier work in the field, we propose emergence measures that are well-suited for continuous attributes (or hybrid attribute sets) using either non-parametric or model-based probability density estimation techniques. We also replace the known entropy-based emergence measures by divergence measures for probability densities (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hellinger distance).

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes. In this paper, rapid malcode signatures are automatically generated based on their spreading behavior, specially aimed at automatically extracting and deploying signatures on the packet level, without the need for reassembly that could be used by signature-based firewalls network intrusion detection system.

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards. Our experimental evaluation shows that Scap can capture all streams for traffic rates two times higher than other stream reassembly libraries.

Detecting faults and attacks is essential to ensure the correct semantic of the network, while distinguishing faults from attacks is necessary to initiate a correct recovery action. The approach uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the error/attack-free dynamics of the environment and the dynamics of error/attack data. It then performs a structural analysis of these HMMs to determine the type of error/attack affecting sensor observations.

Most existing models assume that the distributions for transitions between states are exponential. However, this assumption does not hold in many real cases. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-Markov survivability evaluation model, which allows the transitions between states to follow nonexponential distributions. Novel quantitative measures are also proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient system in surviving intrusions. Model validation, which is possibly the most important step in the life cycle of model development, is largely overlooked in previous research. In this paper, a real intrusion tolerant database system ITDB is implemented to validate the proposed state-space models. Empirical experiments show that the semi-Markov model predicts the system behaviors with high accuracy. Furthermore, in this paper we evaluate the impact of intrinsic system deficiencies and attack behaviors on the survivability of intrusion tolerant database systems.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438108","Database Security;Intrusion Tolerance;Modeling and Evaluation;Semi-Markov Process;Survivability","Availability;Benchmark testing;Data security;Database systems;Degradation;Educational institutions;Humans;Information security;Predictive models","Markov processes;database management systems;reliability theory;security of data;state-space methods","ITDB;intrinsic system deficiencies;intrusion tolerant database systems;nonexponential distributions;novel quantitative measures;resilient system;semi Markov survivability evaluation model;state-space models;system behaviors","","2","","19","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine.

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6","978-1-4244-6024-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In some cases such as insider attacks, attackers rely on feedback from the attacked system, which enables them to gradually manipulate their attempts in order to avoid detection. This paper proposes the notion of accumulative manipulation that can be observed through a number of attempts accomplished by the attacker, which forms the basis of the Attacker Learning Curve (ALC). Based on a controlled experiment, we first show that the ALC for three different attack strategies are consistent between two different groups of subjects. We then define a strategy detection mechanism, which is experimentally shown to be accurate more than 70% of the time.","","","","10.1109/CRiSIS.2013.6766353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6766353","Attacker Learning Curve;Intrusion Detection;Strategy Detection;Supervised Learning;Unsupervised Learning","Security;Thesauri","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","ALC;attack detection system;attack strategy detection mechanism;attacked system;attacker learning curve;intrusion detection","","0","","20","","","23-25 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a new paradigm of intrusion detection and classification by combining the sensing potential of self-configuring and instantly-deployable wireless sensor networks (WSN's) with the reasoning capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANN's). The implemented system is referred to by WINIDC (Wireless Sensors and Neural Networks for Intruders Detection and Classification). WINIDC has been designed to detect intruders of many sizes and types. It can be considered as a smart and economical solution for the addressed surveillance problem. It is smart as it utilizes artificial neural networks to classify the different types of intruders. It is economical as it utilizes small, cheap wireless sensor nodes that are self-powered and self-configuring. Traditional solutions to such surveillance problem are expensive, complex and hard to maintain. The results show that integrating ANNs along with WSNs allow for real-time and accurate detection and classification of intruders. The proposed system can be utilized in monitoring intruders to protect assets and national borders.","1976-7684","978-1-4673-0251-7","","10.1109/ICOIN.2012.6164365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164365","Artificial Neural Network (ANN);Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Artificial neural networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neurons;Sensors;Servers;Wireless sensor networks","government data processing;neural nets;security;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","artificial neural network;asset protection;instantly-deployable wireless sensor network;intruder monitoring;intruders classification;intruders detection;national border protection;self-configuring wireless sensor network;surveillance problem","","1","","21","","","1-3 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Decoupling non-stationary and stationary components in long range network time series in the context of anomaly detection","James, C.; Murthy, H.A.","Dept. of Comput.

Madras, Chennai, India","Local Computer Networks (LCN), 2012 IEEE 37th Conference on","20130131","2012","","","76","84","Network traffic characterisation and modeling using time series models is an area which has been extensively studied in the past. Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","0742-1303","978-1-4673-1565-4","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689","Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols","DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks","","0","","47","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Early yet accurate warning of these attacks is critical for both operators and end users. However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks. Our classifier detects those five attacks with high accuracy and does so in a timely manner.","0890-8044","","","10.1109/MNET.2009.5274916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5274916","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Protection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","discovery of attacks;intrusion detection system;network security;network-based attacks;packet dynamics","","1","","20","","","September 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose an attack flow traceback scheme which is based on flow digests and network layer data. Digesting flow instead of individual packet would save memory and be more scalable.

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead.

Unfortunately, existing introspection solutions share a common questionable assumption. This assumption is embodied in the expectation that original kernel data structures are respected by the untrusted guest and thus can be directly used to bridge the well-known semantic gap. In this paper, we assume the perspective of the attacker, and exploit this questionable assumption to subvert VM introspection. In particular, we present an attack called DKSM (Direct Kernel Structure Manipulation), and show that it can effectively foil existing VM introspection solutions into providing false information. By assuming this perspective, we hope to better understand the challenges and opportunities for the development of future reliable VM introspection solutions that are not vulnerable to the proposed attack.","1060-9857","978-0-7695-4250-8","","10.1109/SRDS.2010.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623380","Direct Kernel Structure Manipulation;Introspection;Virtualization","Data structures;Kernel;Malware;Monitoring;Reliability;Semantics;Switches","data structures;security of data;virtual machines","direct kernel structure manipulation;kernel data structures;virtual machine introspection","","23","","25","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48. However, accuracy for this hybrid technique is slightly lower compared to others.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122808","Intrusion detection system;accuracy;artificial immune recognition system;false alarm rate;rough set theory","Accuracy;Data mining;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Testing;Training","artificial immune systems;computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program debugging;rough set theory","AIRS1 algorithm;AIS;DOS attack;IT department;J48 algorithm;NSL-KDD;Rough-AIRS 1;artificial immune recognition system;artificial immune system;denial of service attack;false alarm rate;flood attack;incremental learning approach;intrusion detection system;memory storage;redundant feature;rough set theory;security threat;software bug","","0","","15","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method uses a deep belief network (DBN), implemented with a deep stack of denoising autoencoders, generating an invariant compact representation of the malware behavior. While conventional signature and token based methods for malware detection do not detect a majority of new variants for existing malware, the results presented in this paper show that signatures generated by the DBN allow for an accurate classification of new malware variants. Using a dataset containing hundreds of variants for several major malware families, our method achieves 98.6% classification accuracy using the signatures generated by the DBN. The presented method is completely agnostic to the type of malware behavior that is logged (e.g., API calls and their parameters, registry entries, websites and ports accessed, etc.), and can use any raw input from a sandbox to successfully train the deep neural network which is used to generate malware signatures.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280815","Autoencoders;Automatic Signature Generation;Deep Belief Network;Deep Learning;Malware","Malware;Training","belief networks;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","DBN;DeepSign;automatic malware signature classification;automatic malware signature generation;deep belief network;deep learning;deep neural network;deep stack denoising autoencoders;deep unsupervised neural network;malware behavior invariant compact representation;malware families","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It's difficult to detect out by conventional techniques as firewall or misuse-based intrusion detection. Anomaly detection has been considered as a promising approach for masquerade detection, which is based on the idea that significant departures from normal behavior could be considered due to a masquerade. However, for low detection accuracy and high false alarm rate, it is still in research stage. Till now, many methods have been proposed from different viewpoints, such as Hidden Markov Model, Naive Bayes, SVM, and so on. Compared with other methods that with well theoretical backgrounds, two intuitive determined statistical methods: the Customized Grammars method and the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness, reported the much better detection efficiency. Especially, both methods based on the intuitive notion that the more frequently a usage pattern was employed by current user previously, the more indicative of normal. In other hand, the statistics of usage pattern in the Customized Grammars method was based on sequential grammars, and that of the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness was on commands and 2-grams. In this paper, these two methods are compared and evaluated on two benchmark data sets of Unix command sequence: the Schonlau data and the Greenberg data. As a result, contributions of command frequency and command sequence grammar in IDS were analyzed and clarified.","","978-1-4244-3782-5","978-4-9904-2590-6","10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045945","Command sequence;Customized grammar;Intrusion detection system (IDS);Masquerade detection;N-gram;Self signature;Uniqueness;Unix","Application software;Computer applications;Computer industry;Data security;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Statistical analysis;Statistics;Support vector machines","Unix;authorisation;grammars;statistical analysis","Greenberg data;IDS;Schonlau data;Unix command sequence;anomaly detection;command frequency;command sequence grammar;customized grammars;firewall;masquerade detection;misuse-based intrusion detection;self signature approach;statistical methods","","1","","18","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common approach in intrusion detection models, specifically in anomaly detection models, is to use classifiers as detectors. Selecting the best set of features is central to ensuring the performance, speed of learning, accuracy, and reliability of these detectors as well as to remove noise from the set of features used to construct the classifiers. In most current systems, the features used for training and testing the intrusion detection systems consist of basic information related to the TCP/IP header, with no considerable attention to the features associated with lower level protocol frames. The resulting detectors were efficient and accurate in detecting network attacks at the network and transport layers, but unfortunately, not capable of detecting 802.11-specific attacks such as deauthentication attacks or MAC layer DoS attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model that efficiently selects the optimal set of features in order to detect 802.11-specific intrusions. Our model for feature selection uses the information gain ratio measure as a means to compute the relevance of each feature and the k-means classifier to select the optimal set of MAC layer features that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems while reducing the learning time of their learning algorithm. In the experimental section of this paper, we study the impact of the optimization of the feature set for wireless intrusion detection systems on the performance and learning time of different types of classifiers based on neural networks. Experimental results with three types of neural network architectures clearly show that the optimization of a wireless feature set has a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the intrusion detection system.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226620","Feature selection;K-means;information gain ratio;intrusion detection systems;neural networks.;wireless networks","","feature extraction;neural net architecture;optimisation;pattern classification;security of data;transport protocols;wireless LAN","MAC layer DoS attack;TCP/IP header;feature reduction;hybrid model;k means classifier;lower level protocol frames;network resources;neural network architecture;optimal set;wireless feature set;wireless intrusion detection system","","9","","26","","2009-08-28","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
