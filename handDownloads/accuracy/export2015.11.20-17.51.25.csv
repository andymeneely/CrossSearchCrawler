Nowadays, another transition from the mobility age to the “Internet of Everything” (IoE) is taking place. In the IoE vision, several types of quotidian objects will be able to communicate over the Internet. As a result, it is expected that within a decade, IoE will have an economic value of $14.4 trillion, as the number of devices connected to the Internet continues to increase exponentially. The support for security services in these emerging resource-constrained devices is considered a challenge but needs to take into account from the very early stages of the wireless network inception. This paper proposes a network-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for IPv6-enabled wireless sensor networks. The proposed IDS is used to detect security attacks based on traffic signatures and abnormal behaviors.","","","","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883583","6LoWPAN;IDS;Internet of everything;Internet of things;Intrusion detection system;WSN;Wireless sensor networks","Energy management;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Software;Wireless sensor networks","IP networks;digital signatures;security of data;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","IPv6-enabled wireless sensor networks;Internet of Everything;IoE;abnormal behaviors;network-based intrusion detection system;policy;quotidian objects;resource-constrained devices;security attack detection;security services;traffic signatures","","0","","19","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many techniques have been developed that can address known attacks and similar new attacks that may arise in the future. Some methods, like Earlybird and Polygraph, focus on string-based content prevalence in payloads; others focus on the presence of particular I386 instructions, e.g., Sigfree counts the number of ldquousefulrdquo instructions in each request. For both types of systems, a white-listing mechanism, in which some strings or instructions are regarded as innocuous, is necessary to avoid a high false positive rate associated with common content such as URL addresses and peer-to-peer traffic. In this paper, we explore a more sophisticated attack model that not only makes malcode payloads look like nominal ones, but which is also assumed to be both aware of and exploitative of the white-listing itself in forming a Trojan mechanism. In other words, the malware attempts to embed its malcode into the prevalent content that is normally white-listed. If the malcode is encrypted, the attacker will also attempt to obfuscate its plain-text decryption code as much as possible. Both current string-based and instructionbased systems will likely fail to detect such attacks. We propose a comprehensive IDS model in the paper and discuss some potential defensive mechanisms against such attack.","","978-1-4244-2483-2","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567340","","Computer networks;Computer worms;Cryptography;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Embedded computing;Humans;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Payloads","cryptography;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","IDS model;Trojan mechanism;URL addresses;code obfuscation;covert malware modeling;encryption;generalized suffix tree;network defenses;payload-based detection;peer-to-peer traffic;string-based content prevalence;white-listing mechanism;zero-day attacks","","0","1","35","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For real time applications time and memory is critical issue. So, there is a need of such systems which will minimize time and memory parameters. This paper presents IDS using two Methods. These both methods based on neural network. First method uses less features of dataset using Principal component Analysis (PCA) technique and second method uses complete features of dataset. Experiments are performed on these two methods using KDD Cup 99 dataset. The results simulate the effect of less featured based incomplete learning technique and complete feature based learning technique. According to the obtained results when the system usage the less features of KDD Cup 99 dataset with incomplete instances of data then the classification accuracy of model becomes less efficient as compared to the entire dataset training but it is efficient for time and memory parameters. So, Method I is beneficial for real time applications.

The winning neuron's index value from every SOM in self-organizing layer is then organized in the sampling layer to generate another 2D map, which could then be fed to a second self-organizing layer. In this way, local information is gathered together, forming more global information in higher layers. The construction method of the DSOM is unique and will be introduced in this paper.

Its high computational demands have been pushing networking researchers to study how to improve DPI technologies. However, in this quest for better performance, little effort has been devoted to making fair performance comparisons among DPIs. Even worse, most studies show performance gains by applying DPI techniques using specific, and sometimes small, signature sets. Consequently, one DPI engine may report a certain maximum throughput while another one may report a similar performance but may have used a significantly smaller signature set. This fact makes it clear that the research community needs a well-defined framework for testing new DPI systems.

In this paper, we propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signatures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do not pass the verification. Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets. Analytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained for players in the proposed game, and significant benefits can be provided to forwarders such that many of the bad packets will be eliminated by verification.","","978-1-4244-0974-7","978-1-4244-0975-4","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550349","","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Computer crime;Filtering;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","21","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The novel idea pursued in this study is to exploit the real time properties of data in intrusion detection. Data objects will be tagged with “time semantics” that capture expectations about update rates that are unknown to the intruders. This is not simply timestamping data. Our notion of time signatures can be used to detect violations of the security policy. For testing purposes, we use intruders that disguise themselves as “normal” transactions, and compare the ability of different numerically quantifiable measures to capture the behavior of the expected update and to recognize intrusions. For instance, by using a hidden periodic update rate, the system can detect unauthorized update requests, as they will likely not occur at the right time, thereby triggering an alarm to the system. The experimental results show that this technique could be a powerful discriminating measure to identify intruders with a low false alarm rate.

A prototype of the proposed architecture was implemented using as a basis the very popular open-source software Snort, a network-based intrusion detection and prevention system. The prototype of the proposed architecture extends the basic functionality of Snort, making use of the preprocessing feature that permits analyzing protocols of layers above the TCP/UDP one. The preprocessors block is a very powerful one since it permits to implement both knowledge and behavior based intrusion detection and prevention techniques in Snort that basically adopts a network based technique. An important requirement of an IPS is that legitimate traffic should be forwarded to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service.

However, nothing is done in applying Z to developing security-critical systems. The intrusion detection technology is one of the most important dynamic security technologies, which can be used in the critical security system construction and the basic service protection. Apparently, applying formal specification to the procedure of developing an intrusion detection system can fulfill their security requirement and win the confidence of users of the secured systems. Taking a DDoS intrusion detection system as an example, we establish integrity sub-regular database through analyzing the default characteristics and universal characteristics in communication of DDoS attack, which can guarantee fast and effective detection in each appeared DDoS attack. At the same time, we use the simple association rules mining algorithm mine new rules and their association pattern to detect the unknown attack, and illustrate how Z can be used to specify and model the security-critical systems.","","978-1-4244-3581-4","","10.1109/ETCS.2009.388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959103","IDS;Z;formal model;rule mining algorithm","Communication system security;Computer crime;Data mining;Data security;Formal specifications;Intrusion detection;Protection;Software design;Software systems;Specification languages","formal specification;security of data;specification languages","DDoS attack;DDoS intrusion detection system;IDS;Z specification language;dynamic security technologies;formal modeling;formal specification;intrusion detection technology;security-critical systems;service protection","","1","","6","","","7-8 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International","20080815","2008","","","606","613","While a variety of AIDS (anomaly-based intrusion detection system) are claimed to be fully distributed, lightweight, and ready for application, their detection cost are not always neglectable, especially when considering the fact that MANET nodes have scarce resources which usually impels them to avoid any unnecessary action. It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.","","978-1-4244-2201-2","978-1-4244-2202-9","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004","","Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy","","1","","18","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is time and memory consuming for large datasets. This study proposed a parameter-free method to accelerate NNR. This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed parameter-free classification algorithm is very easy to operate and gives consideration to speed and accuracy.","","978-1-4244-0973-0","978-1-4244-0973-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370457","Accelerating;Classification;Clustering;Nearest neighbor;Parameter-Free","Acceleration;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data mining;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Training data","pattern classification;pattern clustering","class-based clustering;cluster representations;fast nearest neighbor classification;nearest neighbor rule;parameter-free classifier","","1","","18","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, with the surge of complex offered services from one side and the proliferation of hackers' refined, advanced, and sophisticated techniques from the other side, the task of containing cyber scanning poses serious issues and challenges. Furthermore recently, there has been a flourishing of a cyber phenomenon dubbed as cyber scanning campaigns - scanning techniques that are highly distributed, possess composite stealth capabilities and high coordination - rendering almost all current detection techniques unfeasible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the entire cyber scanning topic. It categorizes cyber scanning by elaborating on its nature, strategies and approaches. It also provides the reader with a classification and an exhaustive review of its techniques. Moreover, it offers a taxonomy of the current literature by focusing on distributed cyber scanning detection methods.

In response to this, a number of countermeasures have been developed, including intrusion detection systems that aim to detect anomalous behaviour caused by attacks. We present a set of socio-technical challenges associated with developing an intrusion detection system for a community wireless mesh network. The attack space on a mesh network is particularly large; we motivate the need for and describe the challenges of adopting an asset-driven approach to managing this space.

A key issue of IDS performance is the operation of its firewall to block malicious user requests. Depending on the complexity of the firewall ruleset, filtering performance of the IDS can decrease considerably during high-load flooding situations. In this paper we propose a scheme to increase IDS firewall performance by merging several similar rules into more general ones and ignoring lesser relevant rules to limit the number of firewall rules. We formalise a mathematical model to compute new firewall rules and show exemplary with traffic from SIP VoIP communication networks how the calculation can be performed.

However, due to their computation requirements and inefficiency against internal attacks, the prevention only mechanisms are not powerful enough to secure MANET routing protocols. In this paper, we present a distributed and cooperative scheme for MANETs routing attacks detection. The scheme collects and analyzes data that are sensitive to routing attacks so as to detect anomalous events. In this scheme, both direct observations and indirect observations are used so as to characterize the behaviors of both neighboring and remote nodes.

Even for a single time instant, it is a complex task to methodologically determine the infrastructure over which these services are provided and the corresponding effect on user perceived performance. For such tasks, researchers typically rely on active measurements or large numbers of volunteer users. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach, which we refer to as passive crowd-based monitoring. More specifically, we use passively collected proxy logs from a global enterprise to observe differences in the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users on different continents. We also show how this technique can measure properties of the underlying infrastructures of different Web content providers. While some of these properties have been observed using active measurements, we are the first to show that many of these properties (such as location of servers) can be obtained using passive measurements of actual user activity. Passive crowd-based monitoring has the advantages that it does not add any overhead on Web infrastructure, it does not require any specific software on the clients, but still captures the performance and infrastructure observed by actual Web usage.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363979","","Gold;Google;Monitoring;Quality of service;Servers;Throughput;YouTube","Internet;quality of service","QoS;Web content providers;World Wide Web infrastructure;active measurements;passive crowd-based monitoring;passive measurements;proxy logs;quality of service","","0","","24","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the unattended operation of WSNs and limited processing capabilities of the individual nodes make them vulnerable to a variety of security attacks, especially disruption of information flow or data corruption. For wired or wireless ad-hoc networks, there exist several automated systems for maintaining their functional integrity. Unfortunately, these strategies are not directly applicable to WSNs since ad-hoc networks are not as resource constrained as WSNs.This paper tries to develop distributed algorithms for detecting anomalous activity in information flow patterns in large-scale sensor networks.

Substation critical cyber assets are isolated in electronic security perimeters using firewalls. In this paper a retrofit data logger solution for serial communication based MODBUS and DNP3 network appliances is offered. The retrofit data logger allows existing control systems to be updated to log network transactions in support of substation based network intrusion detection. Substation based intrusion detection supports a defense in depth approach to cyber security in which multiple overlapping layers of security are used to protect critical cyber assets. The data logger is an embedded bump-in-the-wire retrofit device which captures, time stamps, cryptographically signs, encrypts, and store network traffic.

This paper concerns using Computational intelligence based learning machines for intrusion detection in hierarchical order of attacking scenarios, which is a problem of general interest to transportation infrastructure protection since a necessary task thereof is to protect the computers responsible for the infrastructure's operational control, and an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy. Hence we use SVM for our proposed Hierarchical Feature reduction for intrusion detection.","","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396095","DOS;IDS;PSO;Probe;R2l;U2R;support vector machine","Accuracy;Hafnium compounds;Optimization;Subspace constraints","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;support vector machines","ANN;Artificial Neural Networks;HAB-IDS;HFO-ANID;IDS;SVM;Support Vector Machines;anomaly based intrusion detection systems;attack scenario;computational intelligence based learning machines;hierarchical feature optimization;network security;problem solving;transportation infrastructure protection","","0","","27","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this, we have identified the most relevant characteristics of the network traffic in order to be processed and classified using machine learning techniques, specifically the normalization (Z-Score), dimensionality reduction (PCA) and classification based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to suggest an intrusion detection system (IDS).","","","","10.1109/CCST.2013.6922081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6922081","IDS;Intruder Detection Systems;Threat;classification;dimensionality reduction;network attacks;neural networks;normalization","Artificial neural networks;Boolean functions;Data structures;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data","ANN classification;IDS;PCA;Z-score;artificial neural networks;data networks;dimensionality reduction;intruder detection;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network traffic;normalization;principal component analysis;threat mitigation;threats taxonomy","","0","","11","","","8-11 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a TAG, nodes represent hosts in the network and edges are observed flows that indicate certain communication relations or interactions of interest among the hosts. The challenge is how to capture and analyze TAGs which are usually large, sparse and complex and often have overly-large space and computation requirements. In this paper, we present a new sampling-based low-rank approximation method for monitoring TAGs. The resulted solution can reduce the computation complexity for the communication pattern analysis from O(mn) to O(m+n), where m and n denote the number of sources and destinations, respectively. The experimental results with real-world traffic traces show that our method outperform existing solutions in terms of efficiency and the capability of processing and identifying unknown TAGs.","0742-1303","978-1-4673-1565-4","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423680","Low-rank Matrix Approximation;Packet Sampling;Traffic Measurement","Approximation methods;Communities;Electronic mail;Matrix decomposition;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Sampling methods","approximation theory;computer network security;invasive software;matrix algebra","TAG analysis;anomaly detection;attack attribution;communication pattern analysis;malware analysis;network-wide communication pattern model;sampling-based low-rank mtrix approximation method;traffic activity graph monitoring","","0","","23","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a benchmark data from a KDD competition designed by DARPA (U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), we demonstrate that highly efficient and accurate classifiers can be constructed by using SVMs to detect DoS attacks.

An example is to estimate traffic with common strings in the payload and detect potential virus signatures for early alarm generation. We develop a fast, memory efficient algorithm for solving this problem as a variant of the longest common subsequence problem.

Detecting anomalies is hence critical both to protect against misuse and attacks, but is subject to constraints. These include primarily efficiency, but also legal and contractual restrictions limiting the depth of intrusiveness, which can be achieved by an intrusion detection system. In many cases, the IaaS provider will also have very limited insights into the actual workloads used by clients. In this paper we therefore propose to monitor system calls at the VM host level without requiring any instrumentation within VMs and argue that this level of granularity is sufficient to capture a number of relevant attack classes. This, together with the efficiency and efficacy of the approach is shown through experiments and statistical analysis in a Linux KVM-based reference scenario.

ICTAI '09. 21st International Conference on","20091228","2009","","","500","507","A serious threat to user privacy in new mobile and Web2.0 applications stems from `social inferences'. These unwanted inferences are related to the users' identity, current location and other personal information. We have previously introduced `inference functions' to estimate the social inference risk based on information entropy. In this paper, after analyzing the problem and reviewing our risk estimation method, we create a decision tree to distinguish between high risk and normal situations. To evaluate our methodology, test and training datasets were collected during a large mobile-phone field study for a location-aware application. The classification tree employs our two inference functions, for the current and past situations, as internal nodes. Our results show that the achieved true classification rates are significantly better than approaches that employ other available features for the internal nodes of the trees. The results also suggest that common classification tools cannot accurately capture the information entropy for social applications. This is mostly due to the lack of enough training data for high-risk, low-entropy situations and outliers. Thus, we conclude that estimating the information entropy and the relevant inference risk using a pre-processor can yield a simpler and more accurate classification tree.","1082-3409","978-1-4244-5619-2","978-0-7695-3920-1","10.1109/ICTAI.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362617","","Artificial intelligence;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Facebook;Information entropy;Information security;Privacy;Protection;Risk analysis;Social network services","decision trees;entropy;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation;mobile computing;pattern classification;risk analysis","Web2.0 applications;classification tree analysis;data training;decision tree;information entropy;knowledge representation;large mobile phone field;location-aware application;low-entropy situations;preprocessor;social inference risk estimation method;unwanted social inference function;user privacy","","2","","29","","","2-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is largely due to the integration of complex large data transfers across multiple zones of systems and network integration. The increase in transmission of highly sensitive data and challenges of data protection and of privacy, data loss prevention has major significant implications for systems engineering, systems integration, and systems analysis, design and validation. Furthermore, the design and development of complex integrated systems engineering and network systems lack effective transparency, auditability, validation and implementation of adequate security measures for transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks using third party and outsourced networks and the Internet and global privacy regulatory requirements for such data transfer across international borders. The major problem with current state of art approaches of controls for global critical infrastructures of virtual private networks (VPN) depend on inadequate third-party systems. Thus current approaches lack transparency, auditability and validation of the implementation of adequate privacy and security controls for data transfers of highly sensitive metadata across global networks. The additional problem of obscurity has resulted in increasing concealing of unauthorized access, identity thefts, privacy and security breaches of highly sensitive data, interception through the man-in-the-middle and intermediary systems. The paper examines the effectiveness, resiliency, robustness, scalability and adaptability in the design, safety, security and usability of engineering complex integrated systems and network systems for complex large data transfers across multiple zones of systems and network integration and security.","","978-1-4244-3462-6","978-1-4244-3463-3","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2009.4815808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815808","complex engineering systems design;large-scale systems integration;risk management and validation systems;security","Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Design engineering;IP networks;Propagation losses;Protection;Risk management;Systems engineering and theory;Virtual private networks","data privacy;risk management;security of data;systems engineering;virtual private networks","Internet;complex integrated systems;complex large data transfers;data loss prevention;data privacy;data protection;engineering systems design;global privacy regulatory requirements;highly sensitive data;highly sensitive metadata transfers;intelligent strategies;network integration;risk management;secure complex systems design;secure complex systems integration;virtual private networks","","0","","25","","","23-26 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such a centralized approach is not flexible nor is it robust. For example, it is very hard to find an appropriate system to which the user can upload information during a disaster, and the centralized server may be down because of overload or has been physically destroyed. We must consider a distributed and dynamic architecture for the system.

Tested systems included the BlueView ProViewer P450E-15, BlueView ProViewer P900E-20, and RESON SeaBat 7128, which were chosen for the good balance of resolution and range provided by their frequency of operation (450 kHz, 900 kHz, and 400 kHz, respectively) revealed during a prior study. Video clips were recorded from these systems while observing swimmers, open-circuit scuba divers, and closed-circuit rebreather divers in a marine harbor in St. Petersburg, FL. Clips were randomized and presented to 18 volunteer evaluators who were asked to identify which clips contained divers and which did not. The highest scoring system also had the highest operating frequency. However, the same high-scoring sonar in a different configuration scored similar to the system with the lowest frequency. This indicates that signal frequency, and therefore image resolution, is not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. After noticing many evaluators performed poorly with cluttered clips or clips with low acoustic target strength, results were recalculated to remove swimmers and surface swim routes such that only uncluttered, clearly-reflecting targets were included. Some sonar scores were moderately improved by this change, while others significantly decreased. This indicated that target clarity is also not a definite predictor of human assessment performance. Further analysis is recommended to reveal all major factors affecting assessment to maximize quality and eventually bring underwater security assessment to a high level.","","978-1-4244-4332-1","","10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664320","","Acoustic beams;Acoustics;Book reviews;Humans;Imaging;Security;Sonar","sonar imaging;underwater acoustic communication","high security underwater assessment;human recognizable images;imaging sonars;preliminary evaluation;surface swim routes","","0","","1","","","20-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The recently discovered security attacks like W32.Stuxnet and the Duqu worm changed this almost established belief. Further, usual methods of anomaly detection cannot simply be employed in embedded systems since they are usually resource-constrained and the detection methods might interfere with performance of the main system tasks. However, behavior of applications running in embedded systems is relatively known, and profiling the correct behavior and comparing it with the runtime behavior is accounted as an effective approach for anomaly detection with no such interferences. In this paper, we consider the inter-effects of processor temperature and power consumption of embedded systems, and present a novel technique to detect malicious activities with minor delays with respect to the occurrences. This is done through analyzing the simultaneously observed power and temperature of the processor. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by using the power and temperature traces of a real processor obtained through detailed simulations.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994033","X2-distance;anomaly detection;clustering;power trace;profiling;temperature trace","Embedded systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","computer crime;embedded systems;invasive software;power consumption;safety-critical software","Duqu worm;W32.Stuxnet;anomaly detection;embedded systems;malicious activities detection;power consumption;power monitoring;processor power;processor temperature inter-effects;runtime behavior;security attacks;security violations;temperature monitoring","","0","","20","","","3-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary users dictate the system states and their transitions while the secondary users and jammers behave non-cooperatively to achieve their goals independently under different system environment. Our Markovian game model captures not only the zero-sum interactions between secondary users and the jammers but also the dynamics of the system. Our results indicate that the secondary users can enhance their security level or increase their long-term payoff by either improving their sensing capabilities to confuse the jammer with the choice or choosing to communicate under states where the available channels are less prone to jamming.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.","2155-6822","978-1-4577-0753-7","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705","Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS)","Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces","computer network security;data mining","CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule","","1","","25","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation.

Noting that predicates in SQL (Structured Query Language) requests usually have similarity features in a short time in event stream systems, that means events frequently queried recently might be queried again in the near future. This paper proposes a prediction model to forecast query predicates and then to choose them for speculative execution. We propose an adaptive two-level scoring (TLS) prediction algorithm, which can adjust parameters according to the system resource usage conditions. We introduce two metrics accuracy rate and efficiency rate, for query prediction evaluation, and make a detailed analysis of system costs. Our experimental results in DBroker system demonstrate the TLS algorithm and local speculative execution method can significantly reduce query response time.","","978-0-7695-3449-7","","10.1109/GCC.2008.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4662879","DBroker;TLS;event stream;query prediction;stream database","Communication system operations and management;Computer architecture;Database languages;Database systems;Financial management;Grid computing;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Predictive models;Sun","query processing;resource allocation;very large databases","SQL;large scale data intensive event stream analysis system;query prediction;resource usage condition;speculative execution method;structured query language;system cost analysis;two-level scoring prediction algorithm","","2","1","36","","","24-26 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they are still one of the most vulnerable parts of organizations infrastructure. Exploits are many times used by worms to fast propagate across the full Internet being Web servers one of their main targets. New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.","1060-9857","978-0-7695-3826-6","","10.1109/SRDS.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421","exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware","Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server","Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security","HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit","","1","1","36","","","27-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We observe that current network IDSs don't make full use of the information available from different levels and points of the protected network, and we argue that the utilization of this information is essential. We introduce a new framework for network IDSs based on a network context awareness (NCA) layer as an additional data source to IDSs. We describe the architecture of NCA and methods of how to extract network information into NCA. A correlation engine is presented that works on alerts generated by a specific IDS system (Snort) and NCA information.

It is necessary to develop a real-time system to extracting useful attack strategies from the alert stream, which enables network administrators to launches appropriate response to stop attacks and prevent them form escalating. This paper focuses on developing a new alert clustering and correlation technique to automatically discover attack strategies from the evolving alert stream, without specific prior knowledge.

We use the Bro intrusion detection system to monitor the SMTP sessions in a university campus, and track the number and the uniqueness of the recipients' email addresses in the outgoing mail messages from each individual internal host as the features for detecting spamming bots. Due to the huge number of email addresses observed in the SMTP sessions, we store and manage them efficiently in the Bloom filters. According to the SMTP logs over a period of six months from November 2011 to April 2012, we found totally 65 dedicated spamming bots in the campus and observed 1.5 million outgoing spam messages from them.We also found account cracking events on 14 legitimate mail servers, on which some user accounts are cracked and abused for spamming. The method can effectively detect and curb the spamming bots with the precision and the recall up to 0.97 and 0.96.","1738-9445","978-1-4673-3148-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488163","Bloom filters;botnet;detection;network monitoring;spamming activities","Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Industries;Internet;Monitoring;Postal services","Internet;computer network security;data structures;e-mail filters;educational institutions;unsolicited e-mail","Bloom filters;Bro intrusion detection system;Internet bandwidth;SMTP logs;SMTP session monitoring;account cracking events;bot spamming activity detection;internal host;legitimate mail servers;mail server storage space;network monitoring;outgoing mail messages;precision value;recall value;recipient e-mail addresses;spam delivery;spam message filtering;spamming bot detection;university campus","","1","","16","","","27-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using this model, we show that it is possible to perform very efficient sampling with limited impact on traffic feature distributions, thus minimizing the decrease of anomaly detection efficiency. Specifically, we propose an adaptive, feature-aware statistical sampling technique and compare it both formally and empirically with other known sampling techniques - random flow sampling and selective sampling.

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2198666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198335","Industrial networks;information security;network security;risk assessment;security analysis and monitoring;security countermeasures","Availability;Guidelines;NIST;Process control;Risk management;Security;Servers","computer network security;production engineering computing;risk management","Information and Communication Technology;cyber threat;detect-and-patch philosophy;distributed ICT infrastructure;general-purpose computer network protection;industrial computer network;industrial distributed computing system;security countermeasure;security issues;security risk","","17","","105","","2012-05-10","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A numerical micro-scale model is developed to study the behavior of dendrite growth in presence of melt convection. In this method, an explicit, coupled enthalpy model is used to simulate the growth of an equiaxed dendrite, while a Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to track the movement of the dendrite in the convecting melt in a two-dimensional Eulerian framework. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the enthalpy model in simulating the dendritic growth involving complex shape, and the accuracy of VOF method in conserving mass and preserving the complex dendritic shape during motion. Simulations are performed in presence of uniform melt flow for both fixed and moving dendrites, and the difference in dendrite morphology is shown.","","0-7803-9311-2","","10.1109/TENCON.2005.301288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085379","","Abstracts","","","","0","","","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pattern recognition techniques have been used for network intrusion detection for more than a decade. Almost all of such intrusion detection systems (IDSs) use an individual classifier to distinguish normal behavior patterns from attack signatures. Moreover these systems have a high false alarm rate and high cost. In this paper, a hierarchical classifier combiner is proposed to detect network intrusions based on the fusion of multiple well-known and efficient classifiers. The KDDCUP99 dataset is used to train and test the classifiers. The overall performance in terms of the overall error rate, average cost and the false alarm rate is investigated and discussed. Also, the performance of the proposed approach is compared with the performance of the most common non- hierarchical combination approaches as well as individual classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3019-2","978-0-7695-3033-8","10.1109/ICDMW.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476719","","Application software;Computer networks;Conferences;Costs;Data engineering;Data mining;Error analysis;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Testing","","","","1","","14","","","28-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
