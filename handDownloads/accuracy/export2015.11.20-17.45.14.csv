Due to these advancements more and more services are available for malicious exploitation. New vulnerabilities are found from common programs and even on vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network of an entire company. There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator. Then their performance has been analyzed using 10 classification algorithms. Finally the top ten combinations of feature selection have been evaluated among 1585 unique combinations. Combination of Symmetric and Gain Ratio while considering top 15 attributes has highest performance.","","978-1-4799-7682-9","","10.1109/PDGC.2014.7030720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030720","Boolean AND operator;Data Mining;Feature Selection Techniques;Garret's Ranking Technique;Intrusion Detection System;NSL-KDD Dataset;WEKA","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training;Vegetation","Boolean functions;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","Boolean AND operator;IDS;classification algorithms;combinational feature selection approach;malicious network traffic detection;network intrusion detection system;ranking based feature selection techniques","","0","","26","","","11-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several localization approaches have been proposed but most of them omit to consider that WSNs could be deployed in adversarial settings, where hostile nodes under the control of an attacker coexist with faithful ones. Verifiable multilateration (VM) was proposed to cope with this problem by leveraging on a set of trusted landmark nodes that act as verifiers. Although VM is able to recognize reliable localization measures, it allows for regions of undecided positions that can amount to the 40 percent of the monitored area. We studied the properties of VM as a noncooperative two-player game where the first player employs a number of verifiers to do VM computations and the second player controls a malicious node. The verifiers aim at securely localizing malicious nodes, while malicious nodes strive to masquerade as unknown and to pretend false positions. Thanks to game theory, the potentialities of VM are analyzed with the aim of improving the defender's strategy. We found that the best placement for verifiers is an equilateral triangle with edge equal to the power range R, and maximum deception in the undecided region is approximately 0.27R. Moreover, we characterizedâin terms of the probability of choosing an unknown node to examine furtherâthe strategies of the players.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560057","Game theory;localization games;security;wireless sensor networks","Electronic mail;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;Robustness;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;security of data;wireless sensor networks","VM;game theory;malicious node;node localization;noncooperative two-player game;probability;security games;trusted landmark nodes;verifiable multilateration;wireless sensor networks","","0","","42","","2013-07-16","Jan.-Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, due to the nature of wireless networks that use shared medium for communications it needs more security features as its wired counterpart. Attackers can use proper devices and techniques to pull signals from the air and gain access to the unprotected wireless networks from anywhere in range of wireless network which receive wireless signals. Therefore, it is very difficult to trace back to the attacker. The three current location tracking solution: closest access point, triangulation and radio frequency fingerprinting have their own limitations in tracing wireless intruders.

In this work, a classification method is introduced to perform this discrimination based on self organizing network (SOM) classifier. Also, rather than proving well-known abilities of SOM on classification, our main concern in this work was investigating effects of principal component analysis on quality of feature vectors. In order to signify the power of success, KDD Cup 1999 dataset is used. KDD Cup dataset is a common benchmark for evaluation of intrusion detection techniques. The dataset consists of several components and here, it is used `10% corrected' test dataset. Since the feature vectors obtained from the dataset have prominent impact of success on the method, the usage of PCA and a method of choosing reliable components are introduced. At the end it is mentioned that the success of decision by the proposed method has been improved.

However, modern security systems that are applied in today's highly dynamic ICT networks, including malware scanners and intrusion detection systems, apply a kind of black-list approach, where they consider only actions and behavior that match to well-known attack patterns and signatures of malware traces. We argue that for the smart grid a more restrictive approach, that cannot be circumvented by customized malware, will increase the security level tremendously. Therefore, in this paper we present a smart white-list approach. Our anomaly detection technique keeps track of system events, their dependencies and occurrences, and thus learns the normal system behavior over time and reports all actions that differ from the created system model. The application of such a system is promising in a smart grid environment which mostly implements well-specified processes, resulting in rather predictable and static behavior. We demonstrate the application of the system in a small-scale pilot case of a real utility provider.","","","","10.1109/ISGT.2014.6816388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816388","anomaly detection;event correlation;ict security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Malware;Privacy;SCADA systems;Smart grids","invasive software;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","Internet;access points;advanced persistent threats;anomaly detection technique;attack patterns;black-list approach;electricity grid;intrusion detection systems;malware scanners;malware trace signatures;security level;security systems;smart grid ICT networks;smart white-list approach;system event tracking;utility provider","","2","","10","","","19-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","5","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach scales up the balance detection rates for different types of network intrusions, and keeps the false positives at acceptable level in network intrusion detection. The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result. The performance of the proposed algorithm tested by employing KDD99 benchmark network intrusion detection dataset, and the experimental results proved that it improves the detection rates as well as reduces the false positives for different types of network intrusions.","","","","10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.6997324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997324","boosting;intrusion detection;naïve Bayesian classifier","Bayes methods;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computers;Intrusion detection;Niobium","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","KDD99 dataset;adaptive network intrusion detection;conditional probability;false positive reduction;intrusion detection learning algorithm;naive Bayesian classifier;network logs similarity;network mining;pattern clustering;supervised learning process;unsupervised learning process","","0","","35","","","8-10 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current literature for CBAS primarily focuses on the accuracy of the system in order to reduce false alarms. However, these attempts do not consider various issues that might affect practicality in real world applications and continuous authentication scenarios. One of the main issues is that the presented CBAS are based on several samples of training data either of both intruder and valid users or only the valid users' profile. This means that historical profiles for either the legitimate users or possible attackers should be available or collected before prediction time. However, in some cases it is impractical to gain the biometric data of the user in advance (before detection time). Another issue is the variability of the behaviour of the user between the registered profile obtained during enrollment, and the profile from the testing phase. The aim of this paper is to identify the limitations in current CBAS in order to make them more practical for real world applications. Also, the paper discusses a new application for CBAS not requiring any training data either from intruders or from valid users.","","978-1-4244-8335-8","978-0-7695-4214-0","10.1109/HPCC.2010.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581430","Authentication;Continuous Biometric;Impostor;Intruder;Security","","authorisation;behavioural sciences;biometrics (access control);computer crime","continuous biometric authentication;user behavioural characteristics;user profile","","1","","22","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naïve Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, the allocation of processing workloads and the placement of data structures in memory have an enormous impact on system performance. Our work proposes a runtime system that manages these system resources. Much related work has proposed the use of cache memory hierarchies in packet processors.

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources. Our results are important for the development of secure access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access of communication networks from malicious users.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2398834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066967","Particle filters;intrusion detections;networked multi-robot systems;target tracking","Base stations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Robot kinematics;Trajectory;Wireless communication","RSSI;mobile robots;optimisation;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio transceivers;radionavigation","Cramer-Rao lower bounds;centralized coordinated motion algorithm;distributed protocol;gradient vectors;heuristic approach;mobile robots;optimized trajectory;particle filters;position estimation;rapid wireless tracking verification;received signal strength measurements;suboptimal approach","","0","","","","2015-03-24","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Bayesian method has been used in the past on weather forecasting and has been expanded so that it can be used to provide enhanced network security by trying to predict user actions. For this a system can determine if a user is acting unpredictably or has changed their normal working pattern.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","","978-1-4799-7324-8","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","0","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Detecting distributed signature-based intrusion: The case of multi-path routing attacks","Jiefei Ma; Le, F.; Russo, A.; Lobo, J.","","Computer Communications (INFOCOM), 2015 IEEE Conference on","20150824","2015","","","558","566","Signature-based network intrusion detection systems (S-IDS) have become an important security tool in the protection of an organisation's infrastructure against external intruders. By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423","","Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization","computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic","asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate","","0","","21","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The automation system usually contains a rather accurate time source, which could be used to derive the time base for all system components, including the above-mentioned security mechanisms. A number of standard protocols exist for time synchronization. It will be shown that these protocols do not fulfill the necessary security requirements.

One positive example to thousands of negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning treats the extremely small instances as noise. The standard approach for this difficulty is balancing training data by resampling them. However, this results in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing majority instances by partitioning them into clusters. This greatly reduces the ambiguity between minority instances and instances in each cluster. For moderately high imbalance ratio and low in-class complexity, our technique gives better prediction accuracy than undersampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio like splice site prediction problem, we demonstrate that this technique serves as a good filter with almost perfect recall that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed and yield significant improvements over previous predictor. We also show that the technique works for sub cellular localization and post-translational modification site prediction problems.","","0-7695-2457-5","","10.1109/ICHIS.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587765","","Application software;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Genomics;Machine learning;Proteins;Supervised learning;Testing;Training data;Unsupervised learning","biology computing;genetics;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","data imbalance;functional genomics;machine learning;post-translational modification site prediction;subcellular localization;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","","2","","21","","","6-9 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components and has the potential to provide accurate detection performance due to the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space.

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and shift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic.","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635545","Alert Correlation;Data Quality;Intrusion Detection;Security","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Intrusion detection;Organizing;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;telecommunication security","DARPA 2000 network traffic;false positives reduction;filtering routers;firewalls;intrusion alert quality framework;security monitoring sensors","","2","","22","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost.

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data.

Previous papers that implement data mining techniques to detect anomaly attacks actually use well-known techniques such as classification or clustering. Anomaly detection technique combines all these techniques. They are also facing problem on the fact that many of the attacks do not have some kind of signature on network and transport layer, so it is not easy to train models for these type of attacks.

Most of this profile data is currently based on command-line instructions/directives executed by users on a system. With the advent and extensive usage of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line data can no longer fully represent user's complete behavior which is essential for effectively detecting the anomalies in these GUI based systems. Collection of user behavior data is a slow and time consuming process. In this paper, we present a new approach to automate the generation of user data by parameterizing user behavior in terms of user intention (malicious/normal), user skill level, set of applications installed on a machine, mouse movement and keyboard activity. The user behavior parameters are used to generate templates, which can be further customized. The framework is called USim which can achieve rapid generation of user behavior data based on these templates for GUI based systems. The data thus generated can be utilized for rapidly training and testing intrusion detection systems (IDSes) and improving their detection precision.","1080-241X","0-7695-2559-8","","10.1109/ANSS.2006.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1612860","","Computational modeling;Computer science;Data engineering;Discrete event simulation;Graphical user interfaces;Intrusion detection;Keyboards;Laboratories;Mice;System testing","graphical user interfaces;security of data","IDSes;USim;anomaly detection system;graphical user interface;intrusion detection system;user behavior simulation","","1","","25","","","2-6 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming. The proposed approach classifies and simplifies the long observation sequence by virtue of rough set reduction, and the decision conditions obtained in rough set reduction phase could be used in further detection. The experimental results indicate that this method can promote the model training efficiency. Further-more, it is suitable for anomaly detection with high detect rate and low false alarm rate.","","978-0-7695-3641-5","","10.1109/ICIS.2009.140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222872","Hidden Markov model;anomaly detection;decision condition;rough set reduction;system call","Computer networks;Computer security;Costs;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Information science;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Set theory;Software","hidden Markov models;rough set theory;security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;network security;rough set reduction","","0","","11","","","1-3 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method shows increase in the detection rate of about 20% compared to signature based IDS and 10% compared to anomaly based IDS. On the other hand the False alarm rate reduces by 40%.

A number of intrusion detection systems have been proposed for ad-hoc networks. Such intrusion detection systems cannot perform well for wireless mesh networks due to its multihop decentralized architecture. The selection of optimal and secure routing path and detection of multilayer security attacks cannot be achieved using traditional single layer IDS. Most of the MAC layer attacks occur due to non compliance of protocols by the nodes. Such a malicious behavior cannot be detected using conventional IDS. In this paper, a Cross Layer based Intrusion detection system has been proposed which takes advantage of the information available across different layers of protocol by activating multiple layer monitoring and detection. The proposed Cross layer based IDS is novel in its architecture and is able to detect multi layer attacks of compound nature.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","0","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks. DARPA 2000 intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and a testbed network were used to evaluate the innovative alert correlation model. Comparisons with a previous correlation system were performed. The results of processing these datasets and recognizing the attack patterns demonstrated the potential of the improved correlation model and gave favorable results.","","978-0-9893-1933-1","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918249","Alert Correlation;Alert Reduction;False Alarm Rate;Intrusion Detection Systems","Collaboration;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern recognition","security of data","CIDS;attack patterns;collaborative intrusion alert correlation;collaborative intrusion detection systems;correlation components;correlation process performance;correlation processing time;innovative alert correlation model;innovative framework;intruders intention;modified algorithm;security related activity","","0","","34","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main contribution of this paper is a non-intrusive method of a large network infrastructure reconnaissance and an application of acquired data to measure network vulnerability exposures within the analysed network. In this study our assumption is based on an estimation that actual threats come from the actively exploited vulnerabilities. Information on exploit-targeted platforms and vulnerabilities could be easily collected from a large set of malicious websites and automatically turned into signatures. We propose an automated method of building such signatures and use those to analyse the reconnaissance data set to identify ranges of vulnerable systems.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820864","network security;reconnaissance;risk analysis;security evaluation;vulnerability assessment","Browsers;Data mining;Databases;IP networks;Internet;Reconnaissance","IP networks;Web sites;computer network security;data analysis;data mining;risk analysis","IP address;exploit-targeted platform;large network infrastructure reconnaissance;large network reconnaissance data mining;large network risk evaluation;malicious Websites;nation-wide passive network vulnerability assessment;national network;network vulnerability exposure measurement;nonintrusive method;reconnaissance data analysis;vulnerable systems","","0","","12","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As it is used for both supporting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, and connecting vehicles to external resources including cloud services, Internet, and user devices while improving the road traffic conditions, VANET is a Key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). As such, VANET can be exposed to cyber attacks related to the wireless environment, and those of traditional information technologies systems it is connected to. However, when looking at solutions that have been proposed to address VANET security issues, it emerges that guaranteeing security in VANET essentially amounts to resorting to cryptographic-centric mechanisms. Although the use of public key Infrastructure (PKI) fulfills most VANET' security requirements related to physical properties of the wireless transmissions, simply relying on cryptography does not secure a network. This is the case for vulnerabilities at layers above the MAC layer. Because of their capability to bypass security policy control, they can still expose VANET, and thus, the ITS to cyber attacks. Thereby, one needs security solutions that go beyond cryptographic mechanisms in order cover multiple threat vectors faced by VANET. In this paper focusing on attack detection, we show how using an implementation combining observation of events and incidents from multiple sources at different layers Sybil nodes can be detected regardless of the VANET architecture.","","","","10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7245674","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS);Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) security;attack detection","Communication system security;Cryptography;IP networks;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","intelligent transportation systems;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","IEEE802.11p standard;VANET;attack detection;cryptographic-centric mechanisms;cyber attacks;intelligent transportation systems;mobile ad hoc network;security analytics;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless mobile environment","","0","","","","","5-7 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data mining is the process of extracting valid, previously known & comprehensive datasets for the future decision making. As the improved technology by World Wide Web the streaming data come into picture with its challenges. The data which change with time & update its value is known as streaming data. As the most of the data is streaming in nature, there are so many challenges need to face in the sense of security perspective. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) works in the supposition of detecting the intruders to protect the respective system. The research in data stream mining & Intrusion detection system gained high attraction due to the importance of system's safety measure. Algorithms, systems & frameworks that address security challenges have been developed over the past years. In this paper, we present the mechanism to improve the efficiency of the IDS using streaming data mining technique. We apply four selected stream data classification algorithms on NSL-KDD datasets and compare their results. Based on the comparative analysis of their results best method is found out for efficiency improvement of IDS.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155891","Hoeffding;intrusion detecting system;naive bayes;stream data classification;streaming data","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Computer architecture;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Prediction algorithms","data mining;decision making;pattern classification;security of data","IDS;NSL-KDD datasets;World Wide Web;decision making;intrusion detection system;stream data mining classification technique;system safety measure","","0","","18","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a matter of fact, various actors utilise the Internet for illicit purposes, such as for performing Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS) and for spreading various types of aggressive malware. Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems etc.). This paper presents PROTOS (PROactive Threat Observatory System), an early warning system which is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet, using both a global and a local approach. The proposed system is therefore able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2014.6912624","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912624","","Computer architecture;Grippers;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;invasive software","DDoS;Internet threat level measurement;PROTOS;aggressive malware;antivirus software;complex system;distributed denial of service attacks;distributed system;early warning system;global-local approach;illicit purposes;intrusion detection systems;offline statistical sampling;proactive threat observatory system;security applications;sensors;threat level estimation","","1","","17","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It changes the non-separable attacks into separable cases and more importantly, it also allows the unknown attacks potentially being identified by their own features. To validate these claims, a classification algorithm is defined under this feature space. We use a subset in KDD Cup 1999 data in the experiments. The KDD Cup 1999 training dataset contains 6 different types of DDoS attacks and the testing dataset contains more 4 novel DDoS attacks. In detecting these 6 already known DDoS attacks and 4 novel DDoS attacks from the normal, we get a high detection rate under this feature space by using the proposed classification algorithm, which shows the discriminative abilities of the feature space.","","0-7803-8403-2","","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384578","","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer vision;Frequency;Intrusion detection;PROM;Performance analysis;Space exploration;Throughput","computer networks;covariance matrices;security of data;telecommunication security","KDD Cup training dataset;classification algorithm;covariance matrices;distributed denial of service attack identification;distributed denial of service detection;feature space modeling","","1","","16","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) have created problem in resource sharing as they are constructed via mobile nodes without any prior knowledge of the existing nodes which may not be trustworthy. Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for establishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network. We also review the routing protocols of ad-hoc networks with trust considerations and select Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), a protocol that can be used in distributed ad hoc network settings for path discovery.","","978-1-4244-6701-3","","10.1109/WAINA.2010.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480623","mobile ad hoc networks;routing;security;trust;trust-formalization","Ad hoc networks;Collaborative work;Conferences;Distributed control;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;International collaboration;Resource management;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol","ad hoc networks;decision making;mobile communication;routing protocols","MANET;decision making;dynamic enterprise collaborations;dynamic source routing;mobile ad-hoc networks;networking technology;routing protocols;trust formalization","","4","","16","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IDS and IPS are designed to identify security breaches. However, one of the most important problems with current IDS and IPS is the lack of the ldquoenvironmental awarenessrdquo (i.e. security policy, network topology and software). This ignorance triggers many false positives (false alerts) and false negatives (undetected attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and prevention architecture where we integrate the characteristics and the properties of the protected system in the traffic analysis process. The experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our solution. In fact, we measure a reduction of 89.59% of false positives and 79.18% of false negatives.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925097","IDS;IPS;Network cartography;Network security;Security Policy","Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network topology;Protection;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","environmental aware network intrusion detection;mainstream security technology;network cartography;network intrusion prevention system;network security breach identification;network traffic analysis process","","1","","8","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) with semantics-aware capability. Our NIDS segregates suspicious traffic from the regular traffic flow, extracts binary code from the suspicious traffic, and performs semantic analysis on it to identify potential threats. Our contributions in this work are threefold: (a) we believe our prototype is the first NIDS that provides semantics-aware capability, (b) our implementation is more efficient than what is reported in (M. Christodorescu et al., 2005) (c) our designed templates can capture polymorphic shellcodes with added sequences of stack and mathematic operations.","","1-4244-0054-6","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639678","","Binary codes;Computer science;Computer worms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Prototypes;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical)","Internet;binary codes;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Internet;binary code;malicious network traffic;network intrusion detection;semantics-aware capability","","0","1","19","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the extended model has significantly reduced the number of false positives.","","978-1-4244-1339-3","978-1-4244-1340-9","10.1109/CEC.2007.4424907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4424907","","Artificial immune systems;Detectors;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Libraries;Mathematical model;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","artificial immune systems;security of data","artificial immune systems;distributed denial of services attacks;extended thymus action;light weight intrusion detection system;malicious traffic;network intrusion detection;network system","","1","3","22","","","25-28 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional load balancing algorithms focus on parallel processing and have less consideration for session integrality. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive load balancing algorithm named MSF (minimum sessions first). The algorithm integrates the static workload pre-distribution scheme based on flow table with adaptive scheduling scheme, can obtain the session level load balancing by dynamic scheduling the flow-bundles in which the session number are minimum. The simulation results show that the scheduler achieves significant improvement in session integrality disruption and has a fairly good load balance both in packets level and bits level.
