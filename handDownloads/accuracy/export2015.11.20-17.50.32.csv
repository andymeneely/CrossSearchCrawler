They are credible targets of active (e.g., terrorist) attacks since their disruption may lead to sizable losses economically and in human lives. It is thus crucial to develop decision support that can guide administrators in deploying defense resources for system security and reliability. Prior work on the defense of critical infrastructures has typically used static or Stackelberg games. These approaches view network interdictions as one-time events. However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights. We also contrast our results with those of static games, and quantify the gain in defender payoff due to misinformation of the attacker.","0885-8950","","","10.1109/TPWRS.2012.2226480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378414","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Cost function;Game theory;Games;Load modeling;Markov processes;Power transmission lines;Security","Markov processes;game theory;power grids;power system security;power transmission protection;power transmission reliability","Colombia;IEEE standard 14-bus system;Markov game analysis;Stackelberg games;WECC 9-bus system;Yemen;decision support;defense mechanism;defense resources;dynamic states;electricity grids;equilibrium mixed strategies;game model;infrastructure protection;power network attack-defense;static games;system reliability;system security;transmission network continual attack-defense;zero-sum Markov games","","5","","28","","2012-12-11","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the large number of false alarms is a big problem for these detection systems which greatly reduces their effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate this problem, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to help filter out false alarms by adaptively and periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor) that conduct the best single-algorithm performance. Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level. In this paper, we aim to conduct a case study in exploring the performance of our developed false alarm filter by implementing a fuzzy classifier based on if-then rules. By comparing with other algorithms that have been implemented in our false alarm filter, the experimental results show that the if-then rules based fuzzy algorithm performs a bit better than the baseline algorithm and can be improved by selecting an appropriate fuzzy partition.","","978-1-4673-0025-4","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233768","False alarm reduction;Intelligent fuzzy system;Machine learning;Network intrusion detection","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","baseline algorithm;fuzzy algorithm;fuzzy classifier;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy partition;intelligent false alarm filter;intelligent false alarm reduction;machine learning algorithm;network intrusion detection system;network security infrastructure;single algorithm performance;stable level","","1","","25","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through the use of virtual machine performance metrics gathered from hypervisors, such as packets transmitted/received, block device read/write requests, and CPU utilization, we demonstrate and verify that suspicious activities can be profiled without detailed knowledge of the operating system running within the virtual machines.

Hence, we introduce a component called a dynamic threat profiler that periodically learns the changing nature of threats in a network. We model and prove the efficacy of the threat-aware signature based intrusion detection approach for obtaining network-specific useful alarms. We also present our architecture and discuss its internal functions. Finally, we present our experiments based on various threat scenarios and the results obtained, which show that network-specific useful alarms formed 95 percent of the alarms that were generated using our model, when compared with the traditional signature-based detection engine where useful alarms form only 30 percent of the generated alarms.","","978-0-7695-3189-2","978-0-7695-3189-2","10.1109/ICIMP.2008.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561330","","Cities and towns;IP networks;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Protocols;Search engines;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","mobile computing;security of data;telecommunication traffic","dynamic threat profiler;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network-specific useful alarms;signature based detection engine;threat-aware signature","","1","","14","","","June 29 2008-July 5 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android is one of the most widely used mobile OS these days and that is the reason why it is the best practice to develop application on Android platform. The application for disseminating location based weather forecast is a client-server application on Android platform. It provides weather forecast information as per user's location or location of interest. While developing a client-server application, the communication between client and database server becomes imperative. This paper discusses detailed analysis for choosing appropriate type of web service, data exchange protocols, data exchange format, and Mobile positioning technologies for client-server application.

The detection analysis which we perform is based on features extraction from network packets dumps and it employs a behavioral and statistical analysis of communications' progress in time and packet index domain. There were performed experiments in four scenarios simulating traffic shaping, traffic policing and transmission on unreliable network channel to make properties of direct attacks and obfuscated attacks as various as possible.

Extant solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely mainly on prior explicit knowledge of specific worm signatures. As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets.

Also existing intrusion detection approaches have some limitations, namely impossibility to process a large number of audit data for realtime operation, low detection and recognition accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we apply modular neural network models to detect and recognize attacks in computer networks. They are based on the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) neural networks and multilayer perceptrons (MLP). PCA networks are employed for important data extraction and to reduce high dimensional data vectors. We present two PCA neural networks for feature extraction: linear PCA (LPCA) and nonlinear PCA (NPCA). MLP is employed to detect and recognize attacks using feature-extracted data instead of original data. The proposed approaches are tested with the help of KDD-99 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed models are promising in terms of accuracy and computational time for real world intrusion detection.","1098-7576","978-1-4244-1379-9","978-1-4244-1380-5","10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4371391","","Computer networks;Computer vision;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Multi-layer neural network;Multilayer perceptrons;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Vectors","computer networks;data mining;data reduction;feature extraction;multilayer perceptrons;principal component analysis;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","IDS;PCA neural networks;audit data;computer network attack recognition;data extraction;dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;intrusion detection systems;linear PCA;modular neural network models;multilayer perceptrons;nonlinear PCA;principal component analysis","","10","","17","","","12-17 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, we must improve the accuracy by using learning algorithms to classify the normal operations from the abnormal ones such algorithms include tf-idf, association rules, k-means clustering, and decision tree. Secondly, we may adapt for less accuracy in order to gain speed for both with and/or without parallel processing techniques. We also construct an adaptive learning algorithm to update the model.

The behavior based monitoring is used to avoid the polymorphic malicious code. Signature based detection system or fixing these vulnerabilities are not the efficient method. Thus the behavior based monitoring is used to avoid malicious code in window system. Some of them hook high level system APIs to detect the suspicious behavior of the code. Thus this cannot detect malicious code that directly invokes the native APIs. Thus a security scheme is used, that hooks native APIs in the kernel mode. It provides authentication of the system service caller in the kernel mode. So it prevents the malicious code calling native API directly. To provide extra authentication the dispatch ID is scrambled. For the scrambling to take place first the dispatch ID is distinguished as local ID and remote ID and then the filter is used to find the legitimate user. Next the scrambling is done with that legitimate user ID. The unscrambling is done to get the original dispatch ID only if it is a legitimate user. It introduces an average eight percent computation overhead into the system.","","978-1-4673-2756-5","","10.1109/ICRCC.2012.6450586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450586","Malicious code;Native API;Scrambling","Browsers;Computers;Educational institutions;Kernel;Monitoring;Registers","application program interfaces;security of data","behavior based monitoring;high level system API;kernel mode;local ID;malicious code prevention;polymorphic malicious code;remote ID;security scheme;signature based detection system;system service caller;window system","","0","","11","","","21-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While static defence technologies such as firewalls and anti-virus provide basic protection for computer networks, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can improve overall security by identifying and responding to novel malicious activities.

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination. The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-99) dataset is used as a benchmark to compare this method with other existing techniques.

Applying data mining and machine learning techniques to network intrusion detection often faces the problem of very large training dataset size. For example, the training dataset commonly used for the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project contained approximately five hundred thousand (10% sample of the original five million) observations, which were used to build intrusion detection classification models. The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack. A comparison of the actively trained neural network model with a C4.5 decision tree indicated that the actively learned model had better generalization accuracy. In addition, the training data classification performance of the actively learned model was comparable to that of the C4.5 decision tree.","","978-1-4244-8097-5","","10.1109/IRI.2010.5558967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558967","","Artificial neural networks;Biological system modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Training;Training data","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","C4.5 decision tree;DARPA KDD-1999;active learning;computer network intrusion detection;data mining;machine learning techniques;network traffic instances;neural networks;very large training dataset size","","1","","29","","","4-6 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A family of more promising methods detects RWAPs indirectly by identifying unauthorized wireless hosts through using temporal TCP/IP characteristics of SYN, FIN, and ACK local round trip times (LRTT). Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. In this work, we empirically analyzed extensive LRTT data and designed a light system - RAPiD with several algorithms for effective wireless hosts detection. Ultimately, SYN, FIN, and ACK LRTTs can be compared against each other to discover wireless hosts regardless of network speeds.

However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme.

It is being widely used in critical infrastructure for monitoring and controlling the activities. The collaborative environment and interconnectivity of SCADA system needs communications and transmission of sensed real time data like status of machines, breaks and leakages in the system across various devices in the industrial plant. Such real time data provoke security breaches to SCADA systems and results in compromise of availability, integrity, confidentiality and trust relationship between the devices of SCADA systems. As the numbers of deliberate cyber attacks on these systems are increasing, providing a scheme to identify malicious activities and defend the attacks; thereby create secure environment for SCADA systems is an essential task. By considering constraints and efficiency requirements for such networks, we are proposing a scheme that uses Log to identify some malicious activities through continuous monitoring. In Log, we have only prioritized some parameters that help us to detect some vulnerable activities and at node level by using cooperative monitoring the nodes itself takes care of some attacks. In this new approach Log analysis for the identification of malicious activities is made using cluster based architecture. This work also considers the constraints of the SCADA system thereby providing an elegant identification of malicious activities for the current SCADA system.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726619","Aggregation;ICS-Industrial control system;Log Management;SCADA;attack","Computer architecture;Jamming;Magnetic heads;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Sensors","SCADA systems;control engineering computing;industrial control;industrial plants;production engineering computing;security of data;system monitoring","Log analysis approach;SCADA systems;cluster based architecture;cooperative monitoring;critical infrastructure;cyber attacks;human machine interface;industrial automation;industrial plant;malicious activity detection;malicious activity identification;node level;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","1","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","1","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The arrival of advanced wireless communication device leads to demand in the spectrum and the need to improve utilization of vacant spectrum. In the past decade the spectrum sensing and allocation has been the main focus of research than security in cognitive radio. A selfish cognitive radio node is a serious security issue which occupies a part or full resources (pre-occupation problem) in the multiple channel, and forbids other legitimate cognitive nodes from consuming the resources. This self-centered cognitive radio can critically degrade the performance of the network; so a skillful resource allocation strategy should adopted in order to avoid these selfish attacks in the network. The conventional resource allocation approaches in cognitive network are fully dependent. In this scheme, a coalition game theory used to avoid these selfish attacks with multiple PU's and multiple SU's. The proposed approaches consist of multiple PU's and SU's gathered on a set, in which PU allows the other SU's to make use of its resources in contract or agreement on a timely basis. The PU makes decision to select the optimal SU based on their channel status and the SU act as a relay to PU and help the PU in their transmission of data. This scheme adopts efficient resource allocation in a multichannel cooperative manner due to emerging of many cooperative communication devices. This proposed system follows the core concept and also support shapley value to equally distribute the payoff throughout the users in the network.

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load ""hot-spot"", which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS. Simulation results show that our scheme can achieve significant improvements in load balancing without sacrificing detection accuracy.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-2065-0","978-1-4244-2066-7","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575116","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Load management;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;groupware;invasive software;resource allocation","Internet;collaborative intrusion detection system;coordinated attacks;coordinated defense;detection accuracy;load balancing;load hot-spot;network security;source address;stealthy attacks;suspicious activity pattern;suspicious incoming traffic;workload distribution;worm outbreak;worm spread sources","","2","","14","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this method, the hierarchical network index system which consists of three layers, namely, index layer, criterion layer and target layer from bottom to top, is established. The data of the index layer processed by the fuzzy mathematics is obtained from the massive snort alarm information and vulnerability information. The evaluation index weights each layer are calculated by the improved AHP. Comprehensive evaluation is started from the index layer, and by using the evaluation index weights, the factors of security situational are obtained in the criterion layer; by calculating layer by layer upwards, the hosts' security situational values are obtained in the target layer.

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064","","Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security","estimation theory;telecommunication security","detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing data fusion systems rely generally on human experts but they lack of training dataset for the fusion techniques. Thus, useful autonomous approach should be applied to fuse data automatically and accurately. In this paper, a decision fusion approach based on clustering technique is proposed. This technique enables the generation of composite attack scenarios by selecting events generated by analyzers while considering their efficiency to detect attacks using defined efficiency criteria.

The aim of this article is to introduce an efficient system for anti-evasion that can be implemented in real devices.

Denial-of-service attacks have been successful in denying legitimate traffic access to its required resources because existing routing protocols treat the attacking traffic equally as any normal traffic. This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic. We demonstrate through several examples, how our approach can dynamically detect attacks, quantify their impact, and how to reduce the impacts and recover from them.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514527","Abnormality distance (AD);network attack;proactive defense;quality-of-protection (QoP)","Computer crime;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Protocols;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services","DiffServ networks;Internet;authorisation;fault diagnosis;monitoring;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AD metric;Internet infrastructure;QoP;QoS protocol;abnormality distance;automatic technique;denial-of-service attack;differentiated service;network fault;network traffic flow;online monitoring;proactive defense network;quality-of-protection;quality-of-service;routing protocol;self-protection mechanism","","8","1","59","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This approach models illegitimate users as ones who randomly access records. The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic.","","978-1-4673-6214-6","","10.1109/ISI.2013.6578795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578795","Access Logs;Anomaly Detection;Data Mining;Electronic Health Records;Healthcare Security;Insider threats","Context;Hospitals;Information systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Sociology;Statistics","data mining;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;random processes;security of data","LDA;ROA model;RTA;RTAD;anomalous topic access detection;anomalous topic access modeling;anomalous user detection;anomaly detection framework;attacker characteristics;feature extraction;healthcare;hospital audit logs;information systems;insider threat detection;k-NN algorithm;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;latent Dirichlet allocation;machine learning;model formalization;outlier detection;random object access model;random record access;random topic access detection;random topic access model;random users;statistics;strategy development;topic summarization;user roles;workflow knowledge","","0","","13","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. As part of an overall strategy for network resilience, a crucial requirement is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a novel solution that enables the progressive multi-stage deployment of resilience strategies, based on incomplete challenge and context information. Policies are used to orchestrate the interactions between various resilience mechanisms, which incrementally identify the nature of a challenge and deploy appropriate remediation mechanisms. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach via simulation of a resource starvation attack on an Internet Service Provider infrastructure. By initially using lightweight detection and then progressively applying more heavyweight analysis, a key contribution of our work is the ability to mitigate a challenge as early as possible and rapidly detect its root cause.

Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied. The paper demonstrates how the use of the Reduced Power Set yields to more efficient algorithms for combining evidences and to application of Evidence Theory for assessing risk.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266730","","Electronic mail;Internet;Power grids;Risk management;Security;Uncertainty","Internet;fuzzy set theory;graph theory;knowledge based systems;risk management;security of data","Internet;cyber-physical layers;epistemic uncertainty management;fuzzy theory;graph representation;graph-based evidence theory;heterogeneous sources;power grid;reduced power set;risk assessment;risk evaluation;rule-based systems","","","","","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They demand an accurate location of the event detected and is done by using a mobile beacon node to provide accurate location and assume a benign environment. However, in a hostile military environment, such a node can be easily tampered by an adversary. In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster based anomaly detection scheme by assigning few randomly chosen cluster heads a critical task of estimating the reliability of the mobile beacon node. As localization of remaining nodes is cautiously performed only after verifying the authenticity of the mobile beacon node, a considerable overhead is saved in the incorrect localization of the entire network. We perform extensive simulation for different attacks and observe our scheme to have a high detection rate of 99% and a very less false positive rate of 20%.","","978-1-4244-1513-7","978-1-4244-1513-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455300","Anomaly Detection;GPS;Localization;Mobile beacon;Wireless Sensor Networks","Application software;Authentication;Computer networks;Computer science;Distributed computing;Global Positioning System;Intelligent networks;Military computing;Mobile computing;Wireless sensor networks","","","","2","","15","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","1533-2306","978-1-4577-1118-3","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","13","","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method can improve the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection engine. Additionally, good features can provide excellent class separability. However, in the past researches on feature selection, the criteria and way about how to select the features in the raw data are seldom referred to. This paper shows us which type of features can aid us to achieve a better experimental result. In comparison to various types of intrusion attacks, the classical clustering algorithm, K-means is proposed to evaluate the features selected and prove the viewpoint based on KDD Cup 1999 DataSet. The knowledge of feature selection can be achieved by this means. With the usage of the statistics of network traffic, the better evaluation index, e.g. detection rate and false positive rate, are achieved than any other type of features.

Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.

"How dynamic is the ISPs address space?

However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","0","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
