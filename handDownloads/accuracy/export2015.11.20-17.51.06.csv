We present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture that addresses these challenges while facilitating accurate detection of MANET-specific and conventional attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which detection data is acquired at the leaves and is incrementally aggregated, reduced, and analyzed as it flows upward toward the root. Security management directives flow downward from nodes at the top. To maintain communications efficiency, the hierarchy is automatically reconfigured as needed using clustering techniques in which clusterheads are selected based on topology and other criteria. The utility of the architecture is illustrated via multiple attack scenarios.","","0-7695-2317-X","","10.1109/IWIA.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410702","","Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;groupware;mobile computing;mobile radio;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","MANET;automatic reconfiguration;clusterheads;clustering techniques;cooperative intrusion detection architecture;detection data acquisition;distributed intrusion detection architecture;infrastructure protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;network topology;security management;wireless communications","","32","3","18","","","23-24 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20100112","2009","4","","307","311","This paper dedicates to develop an improved perceptron tree (PT) learning model based intrusion detection approach. The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a Â¿gray boxÂ¿ since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.","","978-1-4244-3835-8","978-0-7695-3816-7","10.1109/AICI.2009.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342","decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning","Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics)","binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure","","1","","16","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rapid increase number of video resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize the video events. In this paper, we use the Association Link Network model for organizing video resources from Web. Association Link Network is a kind of semantic link network, which is designed to establish associated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages or documents in digital library) aiming at extending the loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cognitive science considers that the associated relations can make one resource more comprehensive to users, the motivation of ALN is to organize the associated resources loosely distributed in the Web for effectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as browsing, knowledge discovery and publishing, etc. The tags and surrounding texts of video resources are used to represent the semantic content. The relatedness between tags and surrounding texts are implemented in the Association Link Network model. Two data sets from YouTube and Flickr1 are used to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can measure the association relations accurately and robustly.","","","","10.1109/SKG.2013.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816584","Association Link Network;semantic link network;video organizing;video representing","Cognition;Organizing;Publishing;Semantic Web;Semantics;Web pages;YouTube","Internet;Web sites;video retrieval","Flickr;YouTube;association link network model;association-rich network;cognitive science;intelligent Web activities;semantic content;semantic link network;video representation;video resources organization","","0","","24","","","3-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the stage of testing, user feedback is analyzed to adjust the threshold between normal files and viruses.

Since many current Intrusion Detection Systems are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to them are expensive and slow. In data mining-based intrusion detection system, we should make use of particular domain knowledge in relation to intrusion detection in order to efficiently extract relative rules from large amounts of records.

Researchers and scientists are concerned on how to enhance the intrusion detection performance, to be able to deal with real-time attacks and detect them fast from quick response. One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run. The results show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86% on the train set and 85.38% on the test set.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644096","Anomaly detectors generation;feature selection;genetic algorithms","Accuracy;Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","anomaly detectors generation approach;correlation-based feature selection;deterministic crowding niching technique;feature selection techniques;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;principle components analysis;real-time attacks;sequential-floating techniques","","2","","28","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952","978-1-4673-0228-9","978-1-4673-0227-2","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The structural aspects of cyber threats are in a constant flux, rendering most defensive technologies reactive to previously unknown attack vectors. Unlike structural signature based approaches, both the real-time and aggregate behaviors exhibited by cyber threats over a network provide insight into making-sense of anomalies found on our networks.

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7","978-1-4244-0003-4","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Machine learning based internet traffic recognition with statistical approach","Jaiswal, R.C.; Lokhande, S.D.","Dept. of Electron. & Telecommun., Pune Inst. of Comput. Technol., Pune, India","India Conference (INDICON), 2013 Annual IEEE","20140130","2013","","","1","6","The researchers have started looking for Internet traffic recognition techniques that are independent of `well known' TCP or UDP port numbers, or interpreting the contents of packet payloads. Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-arrival times). The main goal is to cluster or classify the Internet traffic flows into groups that have identical statistical properties. The need to deal with Traffic patterns, large datasets and Multidimensional spaces of flow and packet attributes is one of the reasons for the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in this field. ML techniques are subset of Artificial Intelligence used for traffic recognition. Further, there are four types of Machine Learning, i.e. Classification (Supervised learning), clustering (Un-Supervised learning), Numeric prediction and Association. In this research paper IP traffic recognition through classification process is implemented. Different researchers are calling this process as IP traffic Recognition, IP traffic Identification, and sometimes IP traffic classification. Here Real time internet traffic has been captured using packet capturing tool and datasets has been developed. Also few standard datasets have been used in this research work. Then using standard attribute selection algorithms, a reduced statistical feature dataset has been developed. After that, Six ML algorithms AdaboostM1, C4.5, Random Forest tree, MLP, RBF and SVM with Polykernel function classifiers are used for IP traffic classification. This implementation and analysis shows that Tree based algorithms are effective ML techniques for Internet traffic classification with accuracy up to of 99.7616 %.","","978-1-4799-2274-1","","10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726074","AdaboostM1;C4.5;Internet Traffic Classification;MLP;Machine Learning;RBF and SVM with Polykernel function;Random Forest tree","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Support vector machines;Training;Vegetation","IP networks;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IP traffic classification;IP traffic identification;IP traffic recognition;Internet traffic classification;Internet traffic flows;MLP;RBF;SVM;TCP port numbers;UDP port numbers;artificial intelligence;classification process;machine learning based Internet traffic recognition;packet attributes;packet capturing tool;packet payloads;polykernel function classifiers;random forest tree;real time Internet traffic;reduced statistical feature dataset;standard attribute selection algorithms;statistical pattern recognition;tree based algorithms;unsupervised learning","","0","","34","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners. We also show that the proposed system, including our scheme and algorithm, provides good performance in terms of the rate of false positi- es.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388436","Adaptive threshold setting;automatic portscan detection;false negative;false positive","Adaptive systems;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heating;IP networks;Real-time systems","","","","1","","19","","","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Masquerading is an important factor for identity theft and current authentication systems using traditional methods woefully lack mechanisms to detect and prevent it. This paper presents an application independent, continual, non-intrusive, fast and easily deployable user re-authentication system based on behavioral biometrics. These behavioral attributes are extracted from the keyboard and mouse operations of the user. They are used to identify and non-intrusively authenticate the user periodically. To extract suitable user attributes, we propose a novel heuristic that uses the percentage of mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio and interaction quotient (IQ). In the re-authentication process, every time, the current behavior of the user is compared with the stored ldquoexpectedrdquo behavior. All deviations are noted and after a certain deviation threshold is reached, the system logs the user out of the current session. The underlying heuristic prevents imposters from misusing the system. Experimental results show that the proposed heuristic can greatly improve the accuracy of application-based and application independent systems to 96.4% and 82.2% respectively.","","978-1-4244-5019-0","978-1-4244-5020-6","10.1109/BTAS.2009.5339075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339075","Behavioral Biometrics;interaction ratio;k-Nearest neighbor;neural networks;statistical analysis;user re-authentication","Authentication;Biometrics;Hardware;Internet;Keyboards;Mice;Neural networks;Pins;Statistical analysis;Testing","biometrics (access control);keyboards;message authentication;mouse controllers (computers);pattern classification;user centred design","behavioral biometrics;identity theft;interaction quotient;masquerading;mouse-to-keyboard interaction ratio;user reauthentication systems","","2","6","30","","","28-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

The characteristics of response include level of operations, speed and time of response, ability to learn and ability to cooperate with other devices. This paper uses the attack time frame as a response model to show the relationship between active and passive response. Furthermore, the Response Model for Intrusion Response Systems shows some other different approaches and stages of active response. Finally, in order to investigate the most common response used by security practitioner and to justify the response model, studies involving 34 samples products from both commercial and non-commercial are analysed.

The kernel based approaches have proven to be quite effective but they cause performance impacts if any code changes are in the critical path. We provide an alternate user space mechanism consisting of process monitors by which such user space daemons can be unambiguously monitored without causing serious performance impacts. A framework that claims to provide such a feature must itself be tamper-resistant to attacks. We theoretically analyze and compare some relevant schemes and show their fallibility. We propose our own framework that is based on some simple principles of graph theory and well-founded concepts in topological fault tolerance, and show that it can not only unambiguously detect any such attacks on the services but is also very hard to subvert.

On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation.

The second is a hybrid-model searching algorithm to improve the accuracy and computation cost in searching intruding subjects. The third is the Universal-Plug-and-Play (UPnP-based) instant messaging (UIM).

These revolutionary and disrupting technologies are available to the users in various hardware form-factors like Smart Phones, Embedded Appliances, Configurable or Customizable add-on devices, etc. One such technology is Bluetooth [1], which enables the users to communicate and exchange various kinds of information like messages, audio, streaming music and file transfer in a Personal Area Network (PAN). Though it enables the user to carry-out these kinds of tasks without much effort and infrastructure requirements, they inherently bring with them the security and privacy concerns, which need to be addressed at different levels. In this paper, we present an application-layer framework, which provides strong mutual authentication of applications, data confidentiality and data integrity independent of underlying operating system. It can make use of the services of different Cryptographic Service Providers (CSP) on different operating systems and in different programming languages. This framework has been successfully implemented and tested on Android Operating System on one end (using Java language) and MS-Windows 7 Operating System on the other end (using ANSI C language), to prove the framework's reliability/compatibility across OS, Programming Language and CSP. This framework also satisfies the three essential requirements of Security, i.e. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability, as per the NIST Guide to Bluetooth Security specification and enables the developers to suitably adapt it for different kinds of applications based on Bluetooth Technology.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6949858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949858","Authentication;Binary Payload;Bluetooth;Confidentiality;Mobile Phone;Security","Encryption;Indexes;Mobile communication;Satellites","Bluetooth;C language;Java;audio streaming;authorisation;computer network reliability;computer network security;cryptography;operating systems (computers);personal area networks;smart phones","ANSI C language;Android operating system;ApXLglevel end-to-end security;Bluetooth security specification;Bluetooth technology;Java language;MS-Windows 7 operating system;NIST Guide;PAN;application-layer framework;audio streaming;communication technologies;computing technologies;configurable add-on devices;cryptographic service providers;customizable add-on devices;data confidentiality;data integrity;embedded appliances;file transfer;framework compatibility;framework reliability;music streaming;operating system;personal area network;privacy concern;programming languages;security concern;smart phones;strong mutual authentication","","0","","8","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to this fact the importance of security in these systems increases. Therefore, the application of intrusion detection systems as security solutions is increasing year by year. These systems (IDSs) are considered as a way of protection against cyber-attacks. However, handling big data constitutes one of the main challenges of intrusion detection systems and is the reason of low performance of these systems from the view of time and space complexity. To address these problems we have proposed an approach to reduce this complexity. Our approach is based on dimensionality reduction and the neural network bottleneck feature extraction is considered as the main method in this research. We have conducted several experiments on a benchmark dataset (NSL-KDD) to investigate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that our approach is promising in terms of accuracy for real-world intrusion detection.","","978-1-4673-7483-5","","10.1109/IKT.2015.7288799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288799","Bottleneck Features;dimensionality reduction;intrusion detection","Biological neural networks;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis","Big Data;computational complexity;data reduction;feature extraction;neural nets;security of data","Big Data handling;IDSs;NSL-KDD;auto-encoder bottleneck features;benchmark dataset;cyber-attacks;information systems;intrusion detection systems;neural network bottleneck feature extraction;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;space complexity;time complexity","","","","","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641","978-1-4244-9330-2","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts. This intelligent system assesses the risk of a cyber-attack taking place and bringing the defense systems to an alarmed state in a timely manner, which can help offer a quick response against an attacker.","","","","10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866746","attack vector;cyber security;danger theory;early warning systems;neural networks;risk assessment","Alarm systems;Artificial intelligence;Immune system;Internet;Neural networks;Risk management","computational complexity;computer network security;feedforward;graph theory;neural nets;risk management","Matzinger danger theory;attack graph;attack surface;attack traces;biologically inspired risk assessment;computational complexity;cyber security;feedforward backward-propagating neural network;immune response;immune system;intelligent system;threat data","","2","","10","","","29-31 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. We implement OpenSec in the GENI testbed to evaluate the flexibility, accuracy and scalability of the framework. The experimental setup includes deep packet inspection, intrusion detection and network quarantining to secure a web server from network scanners.

Our schemes use different independent memory noise filling techniques called pre-deployment and post-deployment noise filling, and also different communication protocols for attestation purpose. The protocols are well-suited for wireless sensor networks, where external factors , such as channel collision, result in network delay.

The first layer uses FCM and GK fuzzy clustering to extract the features and the second layer uses a set of RBF neural networks to perform the classification. The flexible design parameters are initial number of clusters, number of RBF networks and number of neurons inside each network which are determined with minimal input from the user.

In the proposed framework, there are two modules, the data preprocessing module and the classifier module. Data preprocessing module is the process of preparing and adjusting the raw data in order to feed into the classification algorithms. Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not. The study was based on available network traffic datasets (KDD'99 dataset and WiSNet dataset). According to the experimental results, using the multi-classifiers and the Boolean weighted scoring can better detect the attack instances than the single classifier does.","","978-1-4673-1937-9","","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297119","Classification algorithm;Intrusion Detection;Scoring and Weighting","Computational modeling;Computers;Data preprocessing;Intrusion detection;Probes;Telecommunication traffic;Training","Boolean algebra;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","Boolean value;Boolean weighted score method;KDD99 dataset;WiSNet dataset;attack detection;attack type;attribute learning;attribute scores;classification algorithm;classifier module;data preprocessing module;multiple classifiers;network traffic dataset;probability;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection system;training model","","0","","32","","","12-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These appliances are therefore vulnerable to the same threats that plague desktop computers, including viruses and worms. Owing to their connectivity, uniform configuration and lack of professional administration, they also run a serious risk of being exploited for DDOS (distributed denial of service) attacks. This is where many previously infected appliances are woken up simultaneously by an evil master and ordered to bombard a designated victim from all sides. In this paper, we explore threats and defenses for this scenario.

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.","1550-445X","978-1-4799-3629-8","","10.1109/AINA.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655","Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security","Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology","filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection","","0","","19","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High performance security analytics is proposed to address this challenge by which the real-time event information can be normalized, centralized, and correlated to help identify the current running state of the target environment. As an example of next generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Security Analytics Lab (SAL) has been designed and implemented based on the newly emerged In-Memory data management technique, which makes it possible to efficiently organize, access, and process different types of event information through a consistent central storage and interface. In this paper, the multi-core architecture is introduced on the event correlation module of SAL platform by which the correlation tasks can be executed in parallel by different computing resources. The k-means algorithm is implemented as an example of possible event clustering and correlation algorithms.

Cloud computing has very appealing features, however, lots of enterprises and users are still reluctant to move into cloud due to serious security concerns related to virtualisation layer. Thus, it is foremost important to secure the virtual environment. In this paper, we present an elastic framework to secure virtualised environment for trusted cloud computing called Server Virtualisation Security System (SVSS). SVSS provide security solutions located on hypervisor for Virtual Machines by deploying malicious activity detection techniques, network traffic analysis techniques, and system resource utilization analysis techniques.

The aim of this research is to develop an intrusion detection system based on a novel concept in immunology, the Danger Theory. Dendritic Cells (DCs) are antigen presenting cells and key to the activation of the human immune system. DCs perform the vital role of combining signals from the host tissue and correlate these signals with proteins known as antigens. In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion based on time-windows. The whole population of DCs asynchronously correlates the fused signals with a secondary data stream. The behaviour of human DCs is abstracted to form the DC Algorithm (DCA), which is implemented using an immune inspired framework, libtissue. This system is used to detect context switching for a basic machine learning dataset and to detect outgoing portscans in real-time. Experimental results show a significant difference between an outgoing portscan and normal traffic.","","0-7803-9487-9","","10.1109/CEC.2006.1688374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688374","","Application software;Artificial immune systems;Context awareness;Detectors;Distributed control;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms","artificial immune systems;security of data","anomaly detection;artificial immune systems;basic machine learning dataset;context switching;dendritic cells;intrusion detection;negative selection algorithm;outgoing portscans","","14","","19","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the large size of training data and time-consuming labeling task, it is wise to select some informative data to train a classifier. Active learning is a family of approaches selecting samples for labeling to build classifier with maximum prediction accuracy. So it is able to improve the performance of intrusion detection while it is not time-costing and labor-consuming. In this paper, definition and some efficient query strategies of active learning are reviewed and suggested. Some popular algorithms of intrusion detection and the combination of active learning and intrusion detection are also introduced.

Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters σ and ν, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time.

This paper describes an approach to detecting temporally distributed attacks based on a modified Hierarchical Quilted Self-Organizing Map (HQSOM). The HQSOM approach emulates some aspects of biological neural networks by distributing the reasoning capability throughout a hierarchical structure.

Most of the recent research on intrusion detection systems for wireless attacks either focuses on just one layer of observation or uses a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. The goal of this study is to detect injection types of attacks in wireless networks by fusing multi-metrics using the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) belief theory. When combining beliefs, an important step to consider is the automatic and self-adaptive process of basic probability assignment (BPA). This study presents a comparison between manual and automatic BPA methods using the D-S technique. Custom tailoring BPAs in an optimum manner under specific network conditions could be extremely time consuming and difficult. In contrast, automatic methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior training or calibration from an administrator. The results show that multi-layer techniques perform more efficiently when compared with conventional methods. In addition, the automatic assignment of beliefs makes the use of such a system easier to deploy while providing a similar performance to that of a manual system.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6687157","","","computer network security;inference mechanisms;probability;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling;wireless LAN","802.11 attacks;D-S belief theory;Dempster-Shafer belief theory;automatic assigned thresholds;basic probability assignment;custom tailoring BPA;manual assigned thresholds;multilayer data fusion intrusion detection system;multimetrics;self-adaptive process;wireless attacks;wireless networks","","1","","","","","Jan. 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

To make the proposal concrete, we use the Intel IXP1200 network processor as a baseline complex system design and show how various improvements can be make to this architecture by evolutionary/competitive design. Various approaches to multi- objective optimisation (Darwin, Lamarck Baldwin, etc.) are compared and contrasted in their ability to generate architectures meeting various constraints.

Recently spectral clustering has gained wider application because of its promising results on several challenging clustering problems [1]. SC uses spectral graph theory to form a Laplacian matrix where the first k eigenvectors of this matrix are clustered using k-means to form representative clusters. The representative clusters are labeled normal or anomalous according to an assignment heuristic. We have provided different techniques to detect intrusions (or anomalies) which are scattered uniformly and form small clusters of anomalous data. To improve the clustering results, the scattered anomalies are detected and removed before representative clusters are formed using SC. For evaluation, a synthetic and real data set (KDD Cup 1999) are used and our results show that the application of SC is a promising approach to the development of an intrusion detection system. From the experiments we demonstrate that the application of SC yields a detection rate (DR) in the range of 91%-100% with the false positive rate (FPR) being less than 4.5%.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925096","","Data mining;Graph theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Laplace equations;Pattern recognition;Scattering;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","graph theory;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;security of data","Laplacian matrix;detection rate;false positive rate;intrusion detection system;k-means;spectral clustering;spectral graph theory","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We are proposing a new technique for the same framework with low dimensionality using information theoretic approach to select minimal set of features resulting in six attributes and giving the accuracy very close to their result. Feature selection is based on the hypothesis that all features are not at same relevance level with specific class.

The communications between nodes are multihop, and provided in a decentralized way without preexisting infrastructure. These characteristics make MANETs vulnerable to many types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, this including, Wormhole, Blackhole and Grayhole attack. This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks. Based on simulation results, our filters prove that these attacks can be detected with a high rate of accuracy.","","","","10.1109/SCVT.2014.7046699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046699","","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","Bayes methods;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian filter;Bernoulli filter;DoS attack detection;MANET;blackhole attack;denial of service attack detection;grayhole attack;intrusion detection mechanism;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless entity;multinomial filter;packet dropping attack detection;reactive routing protocol;received packet drop;route discovery phase;self-organized network;watchdog;wormhole attack","","0","","13","","","10-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recognizing that the smart objects in IoT are most likely human-carried or human-operated devices, we propose a scalable trust management protocol for IoT, with the emphasis on social relationships. We consider multiple trust properties including honesty, cooperativeness, and community-interest to account for social interaction. Each node performs trust evaluation towards a limited set of devices of its interest only. The trust management protocol is event-driven upon the occurrence of a social encounter or interaction event, and trust is aggregated using both direct observations and indirect recommendations. We analyze the effect of trust parameters on trust assessment accuracy and trust convergence time. Our results show that there exists a trade-off between trust assessment accuracy vs. trust convergence time in the presence of false recommendations attacks performed by malicious nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trust management protocol with a trust-based service composition application. Our results indicate that trust-based service composition significantly outperforms non-trust-based (random) service composition and its performance approaches the maximum achievable performance with global knowledge.","","978-1-4673-1238-7","978-1-4673-1237-0","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263792","Internet of things;Trust management;performance analysis;social networks","Accuracy;Communities;Convergence;Internet;Protocols;Quality of service;Security","Internet;computer network reliability;computer network security;protocols;trusted computing","Internet of Things;IoT;community-interest;cooperativeness;direct observations;false recommendation attacks;global knowledge;heterogeneous network environments;honesty;human-carried devices;human-operated devices;indirect recommendations;malicious nodes;maximum achievable performance;reliability management;scalable trust management protocol;smart objects;social encounter event;social interaction event;social relationships;trust aggregation;trust assessment accuracy;trust convergence time;trust evaluation;trust parameters;trust properties;trust-based service composition application","","1","","20","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Over the past decade several DPI systems have evolved targeting specific issues related to traffic management, user/application policing, intrusion detection/prevention, URL/malicious/unwanted content filtering. Snort, OpenDPI, Bro, L7-filter, ClamAV are a number of open-source tools based on custom DPI engines and custom rule-sets. The surging demand for higher bandwidth DPI systems capable of supporting larger rule-sets requires the use of hardware acceleration and hardware-based systems. In comparison to software based systems, the design and development of custom purpose hardware for DPI is expensive. The need for DPI solutions for a range of applications at high speed requires a unified processing platform. This paper presents the research in converting known DPI rule-sets into a meta format based on regular expressions, that can be executed by software and hardware-based processing platforms. To demonstrate this work a Snort2Regex translator has been developed to transform Snort rules into regular expressions using not only the content of the Snort rule but every relevant element that belongs to it and could increase the accuracy of the analysis.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5963095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963095","","Hardware;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Syntactics","Internet;computer network management;computer network security;inspection;public domain software;telecommunication traffic","Bro;ClamAV;Internet traffic inspection;L7-filter;OpenDPI;Snort2Regex translator;URL content filtering;application policing;hardware acceleration;hardware-based processing platform;hardware-based system;high speed network;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;layer-7 content analysis;malicious content filtering;meta format;open-source tools;rule based deep packet inspection;software-based processing platform;traffic management;unwanted content filtering;user policing","","2","","12","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article focuses on the security aspects of SDN networks. We begin by discussing the new security advantages that SDN brings and by showing how some of the long-lasting issues in network security can be addressed by exploiting SDN capabilities.

The classification is based on a ruleset that formerly has been manually categorised according to our PRIvacy LEakage (PRILE) methodology. Such information can be useful both for privacy impact assessments and automated tests for detecting privacy violations. Information about potentially privacy violating rules can subsequently be used to tune the IDS rule sets, with the objective to minimise the expected amount of data privacy violations during normal operation.

Additionally, the IDSs can perform other functions like intrusion prevention (IPS), including proactive functions. A recurrent problem in intrusion detection systems is the difficulty to distinguish legitimate access from attacks. A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies. These techniques are used in sequence to improve the system accuracy, identifying known attacks and new attacks, in real time.

We find the context of an abstract by looking for associated terms which help us understand the focus of the abstract and interpret the information beyond simple keywords. The results indicate that context based classification increases accuracy of classification to great extent and in turn discovers different contexts of the documents.
