Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is developed to identify these network attacks by a set of rules. However, searching for multiple patterns is a computationally expensive task in NIDS. Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance. The first technique performs the w-byte suffix pattern match instead of using w-byte prefix. The second technique finds the matching results from all groups rather than first group.

Moreover, unlike existing OSD tools which are completely ad hoc, our approach is formal and follows the principles of diagnosis problem solving. This formalism allows us to: (a) characterize the complexity of OSD; (b) use well-tested algorithms and (c) benefit from numerous possible extensions. To fully address the needs of OSD, we generalize the theory of diagnosis with a query-based extension.

In this paper we examine the applicability of a cooperative architecture regarding forecasts of UIT on a more complex set-up, with hosts associated with sites geographically divided. The aim of this paper is to detail the employment of EWMA and Fibonacci forecasting techniques covering three major gaps of current prediction techniques concerning UIT: sensors employment, the use of just one prediction technique and forecasts' sharing.

We apply the proposed fingerprint to detect RAPs to evaluate the fingerprint effectiveness. The proposed framework examines every beacon frame size, and compares it with a threshold value. The technique is implemented on a commercially available Wireless Network Interface Controller (WNIC) to evaluate its accuracy. The detection algorithm achieves 100 percent accuracy to determine the RAPs in a lightly loaded traffic environment.

"An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis","Xinming Ou; Rajagopalan, S.R.; Sakthivelmurugan, S.","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2009. ACSAC '09. Annual","20100115","2009","","","494","503","Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3919-5","","10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706","intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;security of data","Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty","","3","","22","","","7-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One example is the filtering-and-refinement approach, a new general two stage technique for more efficient and effective anomaly detection. This paper will try to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the classical techniques presented but as we will see the results are completely dependent on the data sets that are analyzed. We will emphasize on efficiency, robustness and accuracy. We will also try to demonstrate a hybrid approach obtained by combining the filtering-and-refinement method with the DBSCAN algorithm.

In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","14","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ESNTree changes the activation function of the hidden layer and modifies the initialization method of echo state network (ESN). If the number of input features is too large, genetic algorithm is used to extract better features. Thus the complexity of input feature space can be reduced. On the other hand, a divide-and-conquer method is used. Decision tree and ESN are combined to decrease the complexity of the classifier and make the classifier more comprehensible and more interpretable. Experiments show that ESNTree achieves better performance than neural network tree (NNTree).

Besides the increasing data rate, the advent of programmable networks necessitates efficient solutions for supporting packet processing tasks in an adaptive way. Introducing a modification of a protocol or any new protocol in such a flexible infrastructure implies a novel management approach incorporating network monitoring equipment with reconfigurable architecture. The requirement for high throughput and high level of reconfiguration together put Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology into the focus of high performance networking. In this paper, we introduce a programmable, multi-purpose network platform called C-GEP that is based on a reconfigurable architecture. The system consists of two main building blocks: a high performance FPGA-based custom hardware platform and a firmware dedicated for network monitoring. We present the architecture focusing on the system-level integration of specific packet processors. The integration of processing building blocks into one high performance system has great challenges. These are primarily related to specific, limiting factors of system resources - which we discuss also in this paper.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140417","100 Gbit/s Ethernet;Field Programmable Gate Array;network management;network monitoring;reconfigurable hardware;traffic analysis","Computer architecture;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Monitoring;Protocols;Synchronization","computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;field programmable gate arrays;firmware;packet switching;parallel architectures;protocols;reconfigurable architectures","C-GEP;FPGA-based custom hardware platform;adaptive network management;field programmable gate array;firmware;high performance networking;multipurpose network;network monitoring equipment;packet processing;programmable networks;protocol;reconfigurable architecture;reconfigurable hardware;specific packet processor;system level integration","","1","","19","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce four different schemes of attribute normalization to preprocess the data for anomaly intrusion detection. Three methods, k-NN, PCA as well as SVM, are then employed on the normalized data for comparison of the detection results. KDD Cup 1999 data are used to evaluate the normalization schemes and the detection methods.

In this article, we propose an intrusion forecast and traceback system (IFTS) based on union defense environment. IFTS monitors network forwarding traffic, thus forecasting malicious behaviors for its neighbor NMD, called protected NMU (P-NMU).

Many recent efforts have centred around visualising security data in a way that can better involve and support a human analyst in the network security triage process but this potentially gives rise to another complex system of analytical and visual components which need to be configured, trained and understood. This paper describes an agent-based framework designed to manage a set of visual analytic components in order to improve a security analyst's understanding and ability to classify the threats to the network that they govern. In the proof-of-concept system an agent selects the most effective method for event aggregation, given a particular set of events which have been generated by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2906-4","","10.1109/ICCCI.2013.6466310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466310","Intrusion Detection System;K-means Clustering;Neuro-fuzzy;Radial Support Vector Machine","","Internet;data mining;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines","BPNN;Columbia model;IDS building;Internet;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;SVM classifier;business Web application;data mining technique;decision tree;detection accuracy;financial Web application;fuzzy neural network;intrusion detection system;intrusion detection technique;k-means clustering;network security;neuro-fuzzy model;radial SVM classification;radial basis support vector machine;sensitivity;specificity","","5","","23","","","4-6 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And then, a novel multimodel-based anomaly intrusion detection system with embedded intelligence and resilient coordination for the field control system in industrial process automation is designed. In the system, an anomaly detection based on multimodel is proposed, and the corresponding intelligent detection algorithms are designed.

To extract the normal behavior as a profile, conventional data mining techniques are widely applied to a finite audit data set. However, these approaches can only model the static behavior of a user in the audit data set. This drawback can be overcome by viewing the continuous activities of a user as an audit data stream. This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm, which continuously models a data stream. A set of features is used to represent the characteristics of an activity. For each feature, the clusters of feature values corresponding to activities observed so far in an audit data stream are identified by the proposed clustering algorithm for data streams. As a result, without maintaining any historical activity of a user physically, new activities of the user can be continuously reflected to the on-going result of clustering.","","0-7695-2297-1","","10.1109/SERA.2005.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563165","","Clustering algorithms;Communications technology;Computer crime;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Security;Virtual manufacturing","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;audit data set;data mining techniques;data stream clustering","","1","1","17","","","11-13 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs.

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes.

Data Intrusion Detection Processing System often contains a lot of redundancy and noise features, bringing the system a large amount of computing resources, a long training time, a poor real-time, and a bad detection rate. For high dimensional data, feature selection can find the information-rich feature subset, thus enhance the classification accuracy and efficiency. Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy). The experimental results demonstrated that our approach can find features subsets with higher classification accuracy compared with feature selection algorithm based on information gain and GA.","","978-1-4244-6325-1","978-1-4244-6326-8","10.1109/ISISE.2009.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447161","IDS;feature selection;information gai;svm","Ad hoc networks;Artificial neural networks;Costs;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;redundancy;security of data;set theory;support vector machines","GA;SVM algorithm;ad hoc network;bad detection rate;classification accuracy;computational efficiency;computing resources;data intrusion detection processing system;feature redundancy removal approach;feature selection algorithm;high detection accuracy;information gain;information-rich feature subset;long training time;secure information systems;support vector machine","","0","","15","","","26-28 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Grid-specific attacks are different from traditional ones, and traditional HIDS can not recognize a grid user and always with high performance overhead. This paper proposes a grid-specific host-based intrusion detection system (GHIDS) which employs bottleneck verification approach to detect intrusions with low false alarm rate and high detection rate. Working within operating system kernel and performing bottleneck verification by integer comparison, GHIDS achieves high efficiency and accuracy. Security reports generated by GHIDS are indexed not only by local user ID, but also by grid user ID. That is more useful for analyzing grid user behaviors globally by both host administrators and high level grid-based IDS","","0-7695-2751-5","","10.1109/APSCC.2006.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041283","","Data security;Grid computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Mesh generation;Middleware;Military computing;Operating systems;Protection;Resource management","grid computing;operating system kernels;security of data","bottleneck verification;computational grid;grid user behavior analysis;grid-specific attack;grid-specific host-based intrusion detection system;integer comparison;operating system kernel;shared resource protection","","5","","15","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the best-known anomaly detectors used in intrusion detection is stide. (Rather than STIDE or Stide or s-tide, we have chosen ""stide"" in keeping with the way the detector was referred to in the paper by Warrender et al., 1999.) Developed at the University of New Mexico, stide aims to detect attacks that exploit processes that run with root privileges. The original work on stide presented empirical results indicating that data sequences of length six and above were required for effective intrusion detection. This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, ""why six?"" accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may (not) be appropriate. This paper addresses the ""why six"" issue by presenting an evaluation framework for mapping out stide's effective operating space and by identifying conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness. A theoretical justification explains the effectiveness of sequence lengths of six and above, as well as the consequences of using other values. In addition, results of an investigation are presented, comparing stide's anomaly-detection capabilities with those of a competing detector.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.806130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1159659","","Blindness;Change detection algorithms;Computer security;Detectors;Embedded computing;Immune system;Information security;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Solids","computer viruses","anomaly-based intrusion detector;data sequences;detection blindness;detection capability;information security;intrusion detection;masqueraders;novel attacks;operational limits;root privileges;sequence lengths;stide","","24","","13","","","Jan 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the most important features of security devices such as IDSs, AVSs and D-MASs, is how accurately they identify and document threats. By nature, these security devices are difficult to test since they are test systems themselves. The attackers are the testers trying to find test cases that cannot be identified by these systems. Consequently, thorough testing models are required by developers to assess the accuracy of D-MASs, an area in which very little theoretical and empirical work exists. In this paper, we lay out the basis of D-MASs accuracy assessment and we present an evaluation of eight of these systems.

Recently there is a trend that many DDoS attacks utilize Internet relay chat (IRC) infrastructures as the communication channels. In this paper we propose an intrusion surveillance system (ISS) to detect IRC-based DDoS attacks. The main functions of ISS are to observe network conditions, gather intelligence from distributed sources, and determine what potential attacks will likely happen. We give the detailed design of ISS in this paper. We also implement this system by using a new approach of text-based decision making - distributed preference-based surveillance (DPBS) algorithm.

Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as correlated information and the data set is defined as correlated data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a correlated data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the correlated data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in correlated data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective correlated differential privacy solution by defining the correlated sensitivity and designing a correlated data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the correlated levels between records, the proposed correlated sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The correlated data releasing mechanism correlated iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed correlated differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a correlated data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the correlated differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2014.2368363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949097","Correlated Dataset;Differential Privacy;Non-IID Dataset;Privacy Preserving;Privacy preserving;correlated dataset;differential privacy;non-IID dataset","Correlation;Couplings;Data privacy;Histograms;Noise;Privacy;Sensitivity","data encapsulation;data mining;data privacy;iterative methods","correlated data releasing mechanism;correlated data set;correlated differential privacy solution;correlated information;correlated iteration mechanism;correlated levels;correlated sensitivity;data mining;data release;influential privacy notion;information hiding;iterative method;non-IID data set;privacy guarantee;privacy preserving;privacy violation;traditional global sensitivity","","0","","17","","2014-11-06","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by ""licit"" and ""illicit"" network applications.

Intruders can exploit the large amount of cloud resources for their attacks. Most of the current security technologies do not provide the essential security features for cloud systems such as early warnings about future ongoing attacks, autonomic prevention actions, and risk measure. This paper discusses the integration of these three features to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF). The early warnings are signaled through a new finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that captures the interaction between the attackers and cloud assets. The risk assessment model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The estimated risk of each security alert is updated dynamically as the alert is correlated to prior ones. This enables the adaptive risk metric to evaluate the cloud's overall security state. The prediction system raises early warnings about potential attacks to the autonomic component, controller. Thus, the controller can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments, both risk metric and prediction model have successfully signaled early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. This gives the system administrator or an autonomic controller ample time to take preventive measures.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073270","Autonomic response;HMM;Intrusion prevention;cloud computing;early warning;intrusion prediction;online risk assessment","Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Risk management;Security;Vectors","cloud computing;hidden Markov models;probability;risk management;security of data;virtualisation","ACIDF;LLDDoS1.0 attack;adaptive risk metric;autonomic cloud intrusion detection framework;autonomic cloud intrusion prevention systems;autonomic prevention actions;cloud infrastructure;early warnings;finite state hidden Markov prediction model;occurrence probability;online risk assessment model;prediction system;preventive measures;proactive corrective actions;risk measure;security technologies;virtualization","","0","","20","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic.

Intrusion detection system has become a vital part in network security systems with wide spread use of computer networks. It has been the recent research focus and trend to apply various kinds of data mining techniques in IDS for discovering new types of attacks efficiently, but it is still in its infancy. The most difficult part is their poor performance and accuracy. This paper presents an innovative model, called MID, that counts maximal frequent patterns for detecting intrusions, needless to count all association rules, can significantly improve the accuracy and performance of an IDS. The experimental results show that MID is efficient and accurate for the attacks that occur intensively in a short period of time.","2154-4824","978-1-4673-4497-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6321057","Accuracy;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Maximal frequent pattern;Performance","","","","","0","","8","","","24-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cloud environment is required to have efficient security techniques as it contains precious assets such as data, users, technologies, resources and business transactions. Most of the proposed architectures for cloud computing implementations are for individual clouds which do not allow the sharing of attack information with other clouds and hence the other clouds are not able to safe themselves from the same attack.

Our measurement study of CDN infrastructure deployed by five major CDN providers shows that dp reduces webpage load time by 29% on average. If dp has already resolved the domain, the reduction in webpage load time is as much as 40%. Finally, dp reduces the load time of individual static Web objects by as much as 43%.

The main idea is to use a two-phase hashing system and small memory units functioning in parallel to achieve a high-throughput and memory efficient behavioral analysis engine. The system performs behavioral analysis on selected information/user(s) and builds a bell-shaped curve for normal traffic using parallel counters.

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this work is to devise a framework to predict when and which workstations may be turned-on and for how long based on previously monitored uptime. 97 workstations have been selected from a real environment for 42 days to test the proposed framework. From the test results, it showed that there are indeed turned-on patterns on weekly basis. Some workstations have more consistent repetitive turned-on patterns while some do not, and this work created a framework to distinguish these workstations.

"Centered Hyperspherical and Hyperellipsoidal One-Class Support Vector Machines for Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks","Rajasegarar, S.; Leckie, C.; Bezdek, J.C.; Palaniswami, M.","Dept. of Electr. & Electron.

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231","Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks","Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks","","35","","52","","2010-06-10","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a critical component of such infrastructure defense mechanism. IDS monitors and analyzes networks' activities for potential intrusions and security attacks. Machine-learning (ML) models have been well accepted for signature-based IDSs due to their learn ability and flexibility. However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades. Moreover, the volumes of data to be analyzed are beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools. They are not only large in scale but fast in/out in terms of velocity. In big data IDS, the one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data dimensions and volumes. In this paper, we propose novel feature selection methods, namely, RF-FSR (Random Forest-Forward Selection Ranking) and RF-BER (Random Forest-Backward Elimination Ranking). The features selected by the proposed methods were tested and compared with three of the most well-known feature sets in the IDS literature. The experimental results showed that the selected features by the proposed methods effectively improved their detection rate and false-positive rate, achieving 99.8% and 0.001% on well-known KDD-99 dataset, respectively.","1545-0678","978-1-4799-4182-7","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888858","feature selection;intrusion detection system;machine learning;random forest","Big data;Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency;Training","Big Data;Internet;computer network security;digital signatures;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);random processes","Internet sites;KDD-99 dataset;RF-BER;RF-FSR;big data IDS;cyber-attacks;enterprise networks;large-scale network intrusion detection system;machine-learning models;machine-learning-based feature selection techniques;random forest-backward elimination ranking;random forest-forward selection ranking;security attacks;signature-based IDSs","","0","","24","","","June 30 2014-July 3 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, modern DoS attacks that blend normal and malicious network traffic, significantly increase the rate of false alarms, hence challenge the effectiveness of IDS. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy IDS to address the uncertainty problem in distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic. The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. Comparing to other related works, our system exhibited a detection rate of 99.91%,while only produced around 1600 false alarms in more than 5 million test sessions, against DoS flooding attacks, where just a reduced number of features employed.","","978-1-4799-5658-6","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030332","Classification;Denial of Service;Fuzzy Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Taxonomy","Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network security;decision trees;fuzzy set theory;telecommunication traffic","DoS flooding attacks;KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;attacks categorization;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision-tree structure;expert knowledge;fuzzy IDS;fuzzy detection engine;fuzzy intrusion detection system;machine intelligence;malicious network traffic;misuse patterns;modern DoS attacks;network environments;normal network traffic;uncertainty problem","","0","","18","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
