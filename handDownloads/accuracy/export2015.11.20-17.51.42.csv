Rolling back and re-executing damaged transactions increase the response time of the system and may cause a significant processing delay. In such situations, the availability of the system is compromised and the system suffers the vulnerability of denial of service (DoS). In this paper, we propose a defensive executing technique and analyze its effectiveness. Our technique concurrently executes multiple paths of a transactional processes based on the prediction generated by a discrete time Markov chain. The defensive execution can reduce the delay caused by recovery. We also propose a branch cutting technique to reduce the extra cost introduced by defensive execution.

"On using multiple classifier systems for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) anomaly detection","Mehta, A.; Hantehzadeh, N.; Gurbani, V.K.; Tin Kam Ho; Sander, F.","","Communications (ICC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on","20121129","2012","","","1101","1106","The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an important multimedia session establishment protocol used on the Internet. It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364010","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Transforms;Vectors","Internet;multimedia communication;pattern classification;signalling protocols;unsupervised learning","Euclidean distance classifier;Internet;SIP message;anomaly detection;feature reduction measurement;machine learning algorithm;message malforming;multimedia session establishment protocol;multiple classifier system;self-learning system;session initiation protocol;text-based protocol","","0","","27","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks.

The result of our experiments shows that the FS & SVM is not only superior to the famous data mining strategy, but also superior to other intelligent paradigms.","","978-1-4244-1294-5","978-1-4244-1294-5","10.1109/GSIS.2007.4443446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443446","","Artificial neural networks;Computer vision;Data mining;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Machine intelligence;Performance analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","ad hoc-based feature selection;intrusion detection;support vector machine classifier","","2","","21","","","18-20 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system does not require location estimation or credential tracking techniques as used in current research techniques, which are known to be inaccurate. These characteristic management traffic profiles are shown to be unique for each device, tantamount to a MAC identity.

The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures.

Being based on a set of rules, i.e., attack signatures, the accuracy and reliability of IDS detection heavily depend on the quality of the employed rule set. In this context, any conflicts that arise between rules create ambiguity in classification of network traffic or host events, not only affecting the performance of IDS, but also putting the system in a vulnerable position. Currently existing techniques for conflict detection focus primarily on the security policy of the network devices: IPSec, routers, firewalls. In this paper we address the conflict detection in host and network-based intrusion detection and response devices and present a rule management framework that allows rule set analysis for potential conflicts. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach on three collections of attack signatures: the set provided by the vendor of the commercial IDS and the rule sets of the open source Snort IDS and bleeding edge threats.

The project presented in this work consists of three primary components. The first component provides a visual mapping of the network topology that allows the end-user to easily browse clustered alerts.

However, attackers have exploited state-of-the-art techniques to evade these detection systems, such as polymorphism and metamorphism, making existing systems ineffective. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method for the detection of polymorphic worms. It uses improved reverse sequential hypothesis testing (RSHT) to detect portscans which are routinely used to find vulnerable hosts to compromise. Then a CPU emulator is used to execute every possible instruction sequence in suspicious traffic and determine whether it is an exploit code. We implemented a prototype and tested it using real polymorphic worms.

In order to model normal behaviors accurately and improve the performance of intrusion detection, a joint evolutionary neural network (JENN) is presented in this paper. Input features, network structure and connection weights are evolved jointly using genetic algorithm. To evolve all three tasks jointly, a hybrid representation scheme is employed, and penalty factors for the number of input nodes and hidden nodes are introduced into fitness function. The generated-subnet based crossover operator is adopted in consideration of the relationship between genotype and phenotype.

In this paper, we propose a model-based technique for building intrusion detection systems (IDS) for smart meters, that takes these constraints into account. We implement our IDS on an open source smart meter platform.

This paper describes a host-based IDS model, utilizing a Radial Basis Function neural network. It functions as a combined anomaly/misuse detector that helps to overcome most of the limitations in existing models.

While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior.

The technique is implemented in a feedforward neural network that uses a Gaussian radial basis function as the model generator. An evaluation based on the inclusiveness and exclusiveness of samples with respect to specific criteria is applied to accretively learn the output clusters of the neural network.

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.","","978-1-4799-2353-3","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795","IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network","","0","","14","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

LIMS has the following nice properties: i) it requires neither specialized hardware nor modification to existing security protocols (e.g, WEP and WPA); ii) the proposed mechanism can be integrated with an access point in a plugin manner; iii) it provides a cost-effective security enhancement to Wi-Fi networks by incorporating free but mature software tools; iv) it has the ability to prevent a certain class of DoS attacks.","","978-1-4244-1042-2","978-1-4244-1043-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4410978","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Computer network management;Cryptography;Dictionaries;Hardware;Linux;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","DoS attack;WEP/WPA-PSK shared key;Wi-Fi network;lightweight intrusion management system;passive listening;software tools","","1","","27","","","26-30 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security solutions in RFID systems need to be strengthened to ensure information integrity and to prevent hackers from exploiting the sensitive tag data. In this paper, we address the importance of intrusion detection security paradigm for RFID systems. We present an overview of state of the art in RFID security and investigate the limitations of traditional security solutions based on cryptographic primitives and protocols.

As network security has become a growing concern, system administrators lock down their networks by blocking traffic through certain ports and allowing traffic via only selected authorized ports such as HTTP. A recent survey has indicated that around 80 percent of attacks originate in the application layer. In this paper, a framework has been proposed to detect complex application level attacks that easily eludes packet level inspection solution. The proposed method enhances detection capability by performing application-level protocol analysis using semantic classification tree technique. The protocol analysis method extracts only specific fields of the protocol thereby providing significant search space reduction.

Rather than using traditional techniques of attacking the technical shields such as firewalls, many sophisticated computer hackers find that social engineering is more effective and difficult to detect by humans. Why can people not effectively detect social engineering, or more specifically, the art of deception? What can be done to augment human abilities for the task? The current findings warrant several possibilities that influence human ability to detect deception. Factors include such things as truth-bias, stereotypical thinking and processing ability. Knowing that human detection ability is limited, we propose a method to automatically detect deception that potentially assists humans. Results show that a system, using discriminant analysis to classify deception performed significantty better than humans in detecting deception.

K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we present a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN, CUKNN, using CUDA multi-thread model, where the data elements are processed in a data-parallel fashion. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of the GPU.

They are the last line of defense against malicious hackers and help detect ongoing attacks as well as mitigate their damage. However, intrusion detection systems are not turnkey solutions but are heavily dependent on expensive and scarce security experts for successful operation. By emphasizing self-learning algorithms, we can reduce dependence on the domain expert but instead require massive amounts of labeled training data, another scarce resource in intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate whether an active learning algorithm can perform on a par with a traditional self-learning algorithm in terms of detection accuracy but using significantly less labeled data. Our preliminary findings indicate that the active learning algorithm generally performs better than the traditional learning algorithm given the same amount of training data. Moreover, the reduction of labeled data needed can be as much as 80 times, shown by comparing an active learner with a traditional learner with similar detection accuracy. Thus, active learning algorithms seem promising in that they can reduce the dependence on security experts in the development of new detection rules by better leveraging the knowledge and time of the expert.","1063-6900","0-7695-2169-X","","10.1109/CSFW.2004.1310734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310734","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Counting circuits;Data mining;Data security;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Traffic control;Training data","expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","active learner;active learning;attack detection;detection accuracy;detection rules;expert knowledge;intrusion detection systems;labeled data;malicious hackers;operational computer security;security experts;self-learning algorithm;traditional learner;training data","","9","8","25","","","28-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, there still a crucial problem about how to transform human behavior into numbers so as measurement can be easily performed. In order to improve the problem addressed we promote IDS called host-based real time intrusion detection system (HRIDS). HRIDS monitors users' activities in a real-time aspect. By defining user profiles, we can easily find out the anomalies and malicious accesses instantly. With the help of user profiles, we cannot only find which account has been misused, but also realize the true intruders. There is no need to update the knowledge databases of HRIDS.

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers.

It consists of selecting features using an entropy based feature selection algorithm which selects the important attributes and removes the irredundant attributes. This algorithm operates on the KDD-99 Data set; this data set is used worldwide for evaluating the performance of different intrusion detection systems. The next step is clustering phase using k-Means. We have used the KDD99 (knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) intrusion detection contest. This system can detect the intrusions and further classify them into four categories: Denial of Service (DoS), U2R (User to Root), R2L (Remote to Local), and probe. The main goal is to reduce the false alarm rate of IDS<sup>1</sup>.","","978-1-4577-0694-3","","10.1109/RAIT.2012.6194493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6194493","Classification;Clustering;KDD Cup 99 Data set;Naïve Bayes;detection rate;false alarm rate;intrusion detection;k-Means","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Probes;Training","data mining;pattern classification;pattern clustering;performance evaluation;security of data","Denial of Service;K-nearest neighbor;K-nearest neighbor classifiers;KDD-99 data set;KDD99 intrusion detection contest;Naiive Bayes classifiers;R2L;Remote to Local;U2R;User to Root;anomaly intrusion detection system;entropy based feature selection algorithm;false alarm rate reduction;hybrid intrusion detection system;irredundant attributes;k-mean clustering;knowledge discovery and data mining;performance evaluation","","12","","15","","","15-17 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20060320","2005","","","1831","1837 Vol. 3","This paper addresses one aspect of the problem of defending mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) against computer attacks, namely, the development of a distributed anomaly-based intrusion detection system. In a general sense, the proposed system is a co-located sensor network, in which the monitored variable is the health of the network being monitored. A three level hierarchical system for data collection, processing and transmission is described. Local IDSs (intrusion detection systems) are attached to each node of the MANET, collecting raw data of network operation, and computing a local anomaly index measuring the difference between the current node operation and a baseline of normal operation. Anomaly indexes from nodes belonging to a cluster are periodically transmitted to a cluster head, which fuses the node indexes producing a cluster-level anomaly index. Likewise, cluster heads periodically transmit these cluster-level anomaly indexes to a manager node, which fuses the cluster-level indexes into a network-level anomaly index. Due to network mobility, cluster membership and cluster heads are time varying. The paper describes: (1) clustering algorithms to update cluster centers; (2) machine learning algorithms for computing the local anomaly indexes; (3) a statistical scheme for fusing the anomaly indexes at the cluster heads and at the manager. The statistical scheme is formally shown to increase detection accuracy under idealized assumptions. These algorithms were implemented and tested under the following conditions. Routing schemes: AODV (ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing) and OLSR (optimized link state routing); mobility patterns: random walk mobility model and reference point group mobility at various speeds; types of attacks: traffic flooding denial-of-service and black hole. For performance evaluation we determined the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) for various operational conditions at the nodes, cluster heads and manager. The overall res- - ults confirm the effectiveness of the infrastructures and algorithms described in the paper, with detection accuracy generally improving as we move up in the hierarchy, i.e. detection accuracy at the cluster level is higher than at local level, while network-level detection outperforms cluster-level detection","","0-7803-9393-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605939","","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Fuses;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic heads;Mobile computing;Routing","ad hoc networks;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services;wireless sensor networks","(optimized link state routing;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;black hole;cluster head;cluster membership;cluster-level anomaly index;colocated sensor network;computer attacks;data collection;data processing;data transmission;distributed anomaly;intrusion detection;local anomaly indexes;machine learning algorithms;mobile ad-hoc networks;mobility patterns;network mobility;random walk mobility model;receiver operating characteristics;reference point group mobility;statistical scheme;three level hierarchical system;traffic flooding denial-of-service","","9","","21","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20071105","2007","","","164","173","It is crucial to detect zero-day polymorphic worms and to generate signatures at the edge network gateways or honeynets so that we can prevent the worms from propagating at their early phase. However, most existing network-based signatures generated are not vulnerability-based and can be easily evaded by attacks. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","","978-1-4244-1588-5","978-1-4244-1588-5","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","12","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To protect the valuable data of their clients, organizations implement security systems to detect and prevent security breaches. But since the intruders are using sophisticated techniques to penetrate the systems, even the highly reputed secured systems have become vulnerable now. To deal with the current scenario, advanced level of researches are required to be carried out to invent more sophisticated Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Among various methodologies, researchers consider Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) as a very effective and popular tool for developing an IDS.
