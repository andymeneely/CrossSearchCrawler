Such a phenomena is a major issue since it strongly increases the power of distributed massive attacks while involving the responsibility of cloud service providers that do not own appropriate solutions. In this paper, we present an original approach that enables a source-based de- tection of UDP-flood DDoS attacks based on a distributed system behavior analysis. Based on a principal component analysis, our contribution consists in: (1) defining the involvement of system metrics in a botcoud's behavior, (2) showing the invariability of the factorial space that defines a botcloud activity and (3) among several legitimate activities, using this factorial space to enable a botcloud detection.","","","","10.1109/NTMS.2014.6813996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6813996","","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Monitoring;Principal component analysis","cloud computing;computer network security;distributed processing;principal component analysis;transport protocols","UDP-flood DDoS attacks;botcloud activity;botcloud detection;botcoud behavior;botnets;cloud computing;cloud service provider;distributed massive attacks;distributed system behavior analysis;factorial space;legitimate activity;legitimate usage;malicious use;principal component analysis;source-based detection;system metrics;system-based detection","","1","","16","","","March 30 2014-April 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider all network packets before they reach to the end-user by extracting a certain number of features of internet worm from these packets. Our network features mainly consist of characteristics of IP address, port, protocol and some flags of packet header. These features are used to detect and classify behavior of internet worm by using 3 different data mining algorithms which are Bayesian Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest. In addition, our approach not only can classify internet worm apart from the normal data, but also can classify network attacks that have similar behaviors to the internet worm behaviors. Our approach provides good results with detection rate over 99.6 percent and false alarm rate is close to zero with Random forest algorithm. In addition, our model can classify behaviors of DoS and Port Scan attacks with detection rate higher than 98 percent and false alarm rate equal to zero.","","978-1-4244-6986-4","978-89-88678-20-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484868","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Computer worms;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","","","","4","","10","","","11-13 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use this tool to detect malicious behavior patterns using both a custom-written malware and a real one.

However, how to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection efficiently in wireless ad hoc networks is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach for intrusion detection, which uses a novel Support Vector Machine Fuzzy Network (SVMFN) to make the detection more suitable and accurate in various wireless ad hoc network environments.

The self-learning mechanism of the sandbox not only studies the unknown intrusions, but also abstracts the rules and collects the evidence.

This research explores the modification of the smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. Using the results from a previous study of optimized static polling rates to create minimum and maximum thresholds, a dynamic polling rate algorithm was devised. This algorithm allowed the smart battery to gauge the network's illicit attack density and adjust its polling rate to efficiently detect attacks, while conserving battery charge life.

This paper presents a new ensemble-based method for intrusion detection. This method uses feature transformation to create the needed diversity between base classifiers. In other words, first different sets of features are created by mapping the original features into new spaces where the samples are well separated, and then each base classifier is trained on one of these newly created features sets. The proposed method for constructing an ensemble of classifiers is a general method which may be used in any classification problem. KDD-99 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method and the results are compared with some recent works in the literature using the same dataset.

"Creating Vulnerability Signatures Using Weakest Preconditions","Brumley, D.; Hao Wang; Jha, S.; Song, D.","","Computer Security Foundations Symposium, 2007. CSF '07. 20th IEEE","20070716","2007","","","311","325","Signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to enable these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automatic techniques which generate sound signatures - signatures which will not mistakenly block legitimate traffic or raise false alarms. In addition, we need signatures to have few false negatives and will catch many different exploit variants. We investigate new techniques for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures with fewer false negatives than previous research using program binary analysis. The key problem to reducing false negatives is to consider as many as possible different program paths an exploit may take. Previous work considered each possible program path an exploit may take separately, thus generating signatures that are exponential in the size of the number of branches considered. In the exact same scenario, we show how to reduce the overall signature size and the generation time from exponential to polynomial. We do this without requiring any additional assumptions, or relaxing any properties. This efficiency gain allows us to consider many more program paths, which results in reducing the false negatives of generated signatures. We achieve these results by creating algorithms for generating vulnerability signatures that are based on computing weakest preconditions (WP). The weakest precondition for a program path to a vulnerability is a function which matches all exploits that may exploit the vulnerability along that path. We have implemented our techniques and generated signatures for several binary programs. Our results demonstrate that our WP-based algorithm generates more succinct signatures than previous approaches which were based on forward symbolic execution.","1940-1434","0-7695-2819-8","","10.1109/CSF.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271657","","Computer security;Error analysis;Filters;Formal verification;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Polynomials;Protection;Software algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","safety systems;security of data;software reliability","automatic signature generation techniques;critical systems;false negatives;forward symbolic execution;network intrusion detection systems;program binary analysis;signature-based tools;sound signatures;vulnerability signatures;weakest preconditions","","9","2","50","","","6-8 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence it is difficult to apply PAYL on high speed, high bandwidth networks. We use CPP (content based payload partitioning) technique which divides the payload into different partitions depending on content of payload. PCNAD does payload based anomaly detection using a few CPP partitions. We demonstrate usefulness of the PCNAD on the 1999 DARPA IDS data set. We observed 97.06% accuracy on port 80 using only 62.64% packet payload length with small false positive rate.

The Netflow statistics is mainly used to allocate the weights for traffic routing by routers. A new algorithm is thus proposed to get efficiently maximum throughput by the traffic filtering, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in real network circumstances. The algorithm shows its advantages that it just occupies a small part of resources.

Based on multidimensional resource service operators, we model the problem of trust evaluation as a process of multi-attribute decision-making, and develop an adaptive trust evaluation approach based on information entropy theory. This adaptive approach can overcome the limitations of traditional trust schemes, whereby the trusted operators are weighted manually or subjectively.

Almost all types of signature-based intrusion detection systems must employ a pattern matching algorithm to inspect packets for malicious signatures. Unfortunately, pattern matching algorithms dominate the execution time and have become the bottleneck. To remedy that, we introduce a new software-based pattern matching algorithm that modifies Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm using Bloom filters. The Bloom filter acts as an exclusion filter to reduce the number of searches to the large HASH table. The HASH table is accessed if there is a probable match represented by a shift value of zero. On average the HASH table search is skipped 10.6% of the time with a worst case average running time speedup over Wu-Manber of 33%. The maximum overhead incurred on preprocessing time is 1.1% and the worst case increase in memory usage was limited to 0.33%.","","978-1-4799-8171-7","","10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7209081","Bloom Filters;Intrusion Detection Systems;Network Security;Pattern Matching;Wu-Manber","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Payloads","data structures;digital signatures;search problems;security of data","Bloom filters;HASH table search;Wu-Manber pattern matching;data protection;exclusion filter;execution time;host traffic;network traffic;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","19","","","21-23 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to verify the legitimacy of our analytical framework we have carried out detailed numerical simulations. Our simulations mimic the practical scenario where a system deployed using our framework must make a binary Yes/No “malicious decision” to each snapshot of the signal strength values obtained by base stations.

Anomaly detection is an approach of intrusion detection that constructs models of normal behavior of users or systems and detects the behaviors that deviate from the model. Monitoring the sequences of system calls generated during the execution of privileged programs has been known to be an effective means of anomaly detection. In this paper, an approach for anolymal intrusion detection is presented and applied to monitor the abnormal behavior of processes. The approach is based on rough set theory and capable of extracting a set of rules with the minimum size to form a normal behavior model from the record of system call sequences generated during the normal execution of a process. It may detect the abnormal operating status of a process. The normal behavior model in terms of the system call sequences is defined. And the detection algorithm is given for the application of rough set theory in intrusion detection.

The communication in ad hoc network is multihop in nature, where each node forwards data packets to the other nodes thereby spending its resources such as battery power, CPU time and memory. In real world, many nodes may have a selfish behavior, being unwilling to forward packets to the other nodes in order to save resources. Typically, a selfish node will not cooperate in the transmission of packets which affects the network performance seriously. Watchdog detects the selfish nodes in the networks. Collaborative watchdog propagates the presence of the selfish node to the source node. The source node broadcasts the selfish information to all nodes. So there is a delay time in spreading selfish information over the network. An efficient approach is proposed to reduce the delay time in spreading the selfish information in the network. It involves broadcasting the selfish information and route request information from the previous node of a selfish node. If one node has previously detected a selfish node using its watchdog, it can broadcast the presence of selfish node over the network which included the route request packet. So the time delay in spreading selfish information over the network can be reduced.","","978-1-4673-5786-9","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508398","Isolation;MANET;Selfish node;Watchdog","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","CPU time;MANET;battery power;data packets;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;multihop communication;route request information;route request packet;selfish information spreading;time delay reduction;watchdog;wireless links","","0","","14","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many attacks involved multiple attack vectors similar to internet attacks. However, CPS are more vulnerable to attacks. To evade detection, a hacker may apply multiple attack stages to gain the access to a control system. For example, he first employs a group of zombies (compromised machines) to identify the vulnerabilities of the target system and the findings would send back to the hacker through a communication channel. Once the correct access information is found by the zombies, the hacker could gain unauthorized access without violating any detection rules. The control system may be compromised by such multi-stage attacks and an appropriate defense mechanism is desired. In order to detect the sequence of such attack, this study correlates network information and system logs to find the stages of the attack. Finite state model, hidden Markov chain, is adopted to identify the multi-stage attacks and to prevent real damage. The results show that the proposed system can identify the multi-stage attacks in the early stage efficiently to prevent further damage in the networks.","","","","10.1109/CPSNA.2013.6614240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614240","Hidden Markov Model;cloud computing;intrusion detection","Control systems;Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Joints;Monitoring;Security;Training","Internet;hidden Markov models;security of data","Internet attacks;access information;appropriate defense mechanism;communication channel;control system;cyber physical systems;defending malicious attacks;detection rules;hidden Markov chain;industrial control systems;multiple attack stages;multistage attacks;target system;unauthorized access","","0","","19","","","19-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is due to the open nature of this medium that leaves it vulnerable to multiple security threats. Anyone with a transceiver can launch jamming based DoS attacks on wireless transmissions, inject spurious messages, or jam legitimate ones. Jamming attacks usually occur at physical and MAC layers and involves different methods, techniques and technology. Therefore designing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to propose a new IDS framework that enables detection and classification of jamming in physical and MAC layers in wireless networks. To address this, problems that arise due to jamming at both layers are identified and investigated. Lists of parameters and variables are associated with jamming are identified and formulated to detect and classify attacks. Finally a novel IDS framework for detecting and classifying jamming attacks is proposed. This framework is found to be able to detect and classify jamming faster and more efficient.","","978-1-4673-1326-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418660","Wireless Network;classification;detection;jamming;security","Benchmark testing;Business process re-engineering;Communication system security;Jamming;Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;jamming;pattern classification;radio networks","IDS framework;MAC layers;attack classification;intrusion detection system;jamming attack classification;jamming based DoS attacks;jamming detection;multiple security threats;physical layers;wireless networks;wireless transmissions","","0","","26","","","27-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The relative preference among the objectives can be adjusted by varying the weights associated with each parameter of mathematic model.

A comprehensive risk assessment method should consider the risk propagation among risky hosts and flows. In this paper, this is achieved by introducing two novel concepts. First, an interdependency relationship among the risk scores of a network flow and its source and destination hosts. On the one hand, the risk score of a host depends on risky flows initiated by or terminated at the host. On the other hand, the risk score of a flow depends on the risk scores of its source and destination hosts. Second, which we call flow provenance, represents risk propagation among network flows which considers the likelihood that a particular flow is caused by the other flows. Based on these two concepts, we develop an iterative algorithm for computing the risk score of hosts and network flows. We give a rigorous proof that our algorithm rapidly converges to unique risk estimates, and provide its extensive empirical evaluation using two real-world data sets. Our evaluation shows that our method is effective in detecting high risk hosts and flows and is sufficiently efficient to be deployed in the high throughput networks.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2455414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154480","Network risk assessment;flow provenance;network risk assessment;risk propagation","Computational modeling;Correlation;Iterative methods;Monitoring;Risk management;Web servers","computer network security;invasive software;risk management","botnet initiated attacks;comprehensive risk assessment method;distributed denial-of-service attacks;flow provenance;high risk flow detection;high risk host detection;high throughput network security monitoring;interdependency relationship;interdependent security risk analysis;real-world data sets;risk propagation;risk scores","","0","","21","","2015-07-10","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It provide advantages such as reporting consolidated data, reducing data redundancy, improving network lifetime etc. However, deploying WSNs in hostile and remote environments presents security vulnerabilities that can lead to various security attacks such as energy based attacks, attacks on data aggregation etc. Numerous secure DA techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, lightweight models using Trust Monitoring System (TMS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are limited. This paper presents a secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) using TMS at node level and IDS at Base Station (BS) side. Each node in the network assesses the behavior of its neighbors using trust ratings and performs the network activities such as cluster head selection, data aggregation, and reporting to the BS. Then, BS analyzes the received information using IDS and reports the information about the malicious activities back to nodes in the network. In this way, the proposed model identifies and isolates the malicious nodes from the data aggregation process. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this model.","","978-1-4799-6760-5","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2015.7150633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7150633","Data aggregation;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;malicious activity;security;trust monitoring system","Computational modeling;Data models;Intrusion detection;Nickel;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","head selection;intrusion detection systems;secure data aggregation;trust monitoring system;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","16-18 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, P2P networks are vulnerable to security threats such as Internet worms and facilitate their propagation. Internet worms and more generally malware are a major concern to the network security community. There are many different type of worms in the wild, mostly categorized based on how they find and infect their new victims (i.e. active, passive, etc.). In this paper, we investigate a new approach for detecting passive worms and malware in P2P networks based on the popularity of files in the network. As part of our investigation, we crawl the Gnutella P2P network over a 12 day period collecting file names and file popularity statistics. We are then able to extract the highly popular files and identify worm/malware files within them with high accuracy.","","978-1-4244-9719-5","978-0-7695-4322-2","10.1109/EUC.2010.133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703577","Detection;Peer-to-Peer;Worm","","Internet;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","Gnutella P2P network;Internet;malware detection;passive worm detection;peer-to-peer networks;security threats","","0","","17","","","11-13 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classical security mechanisms, namely cryptography and authentication, can prevent some outsider attacks, however, they are noneffective to the attacks and the anomaly behaviors of internal nodes. A reputation-based model for malicious node detection in WSNs is proposed in this paper. In this model, the beta distribution is used to describe the reputation distribution, and the indirect reliability of third-party nodes is introduced.

Recently, Chen et al. discovered that a large category of attacks tamper program data but do not alter control flows. These attacks are not only realistic, but are also as important as classical attacks tampering control flows. Detecting these attacks is a critical issue but has received little attention so far. In this work, we propose an intrusion detection scheme with both compiler and micro-architecture support detecting data tampering directly. The compiler first identifies program regions in which the data should not be modified as per program semantics. Then the compiler performs an analysis to determine the conditions for modification of variables in different program regions and conveys this information to the hardware and the hardware checks the data accesses based on the information. If the compiler asserts that the data should not be modified but there is an attempt to do so at runtime, an attack is detected. The compiler starts with a basic scheme achieving maximum data protection but such a scheme also suffers from high performance overhead. We then attempt to reduce the performance overhead through different optimization techniques. Our experiments show that our scheme achieves strong memory protection with tight control over the performance degradation.

Owed to its wide-spread use and Javascript support, PDF has been the primary vehicle for delivering embedded exploits. Unfortunately, existing defenses are limited in effectiveness, vulnerable to evasion, or computationally expensive to be employed as an on-line protection system. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for detection and confinement of malicious Javascript in PDF. Our approach statically extracts a set of static features and inserts context monitoring code into a document. When an instrumented document is opened, the context monitoring code inside will cooperate with our runtime monitor to detect potential infection attempts in the context of Javascript execution. Thus, our detector can identify malicious documents by using both static and runtime features. To validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real world setting, we first conduct a security analysis, showing that our system is able to remain effective in detection and be robust against evasion attempts even in the presence of sophisticated adversaries. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, and perform extensive experiments using 18623 benign PDF samples and 7370 malicious samples. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can accurately detect and confine malicious Javascript in PDF with minor performance overhead.","","","","10.1109/DSN.2014.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903571","Malcode bearing PDF;document instrumentation;malicious Javascript;malware detection and confinement","Context;Feature extraction;Instruments;Malware;Monitoring;Portable document format;Runtime","Java;document handling;feature extraction;invasive software;ubiquitous computing","Javascript execution;Javascript support;PDF;context monitoring code;context-aware approach;document format;document instrumentation;embedded malware;emerging threat vector;evasion attempt;malicious Javascript confinement;malicious Javascript detection;malicious document identification;online protection system;potential infection attempt detection;runtime feature;runtime monitoring;security analysis;sophisticated adversaries;static feature extraction","","0","","47","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a flow based system to detect anomalous activity by using IP flow characteristics with chi-square detection mechanism. This system provides solution to identify anomalous activities like scan and flood attack by means of automatic behavior analysis of the network traffic and also give detailed information of attacker, victim, type and time of the attack which can be used for corresponding defense. Anomaly Detection capability of the proposed system is compared with SNORT Intrusion detection system and results prove the very high detection rate of the system over SNORT for different scan and flood attack. The proposed system detects different stealth scan and malformed packets scan. Since the probability of using stealth scan in real attack is very high, this system can identify the real attacks in the initial stage itself and preventive action can be taken.","","978-1-4244-4790-9","978-1-4244-4791-6","10.1109/IADCC.2010.5422996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422996","Anomaly detection;chi-square;flow;scan detection","Computer networks;Floods;High-speed networks;IP networks;Information analysis;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","security of data","IDS;IPS;SNORT intrusion detection system;automatic behavior analysis;chi-square technique;firewall;flow based anomaly detection system;intrusion detection;malicious traffic;network traffic;security mechanisms","","0","","22","","","19-20 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that this bottleneck stems primarily from the lack of information related to the actual settings. To mitigate this limitation, we advocate that the way of combining intrusion detection signatures with contextual information is a promising and effective solution. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the construction of contextual signatures in intrusion detection systems by means of hash function to identify and filter out non-critical alarms.

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152μ seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.","2151-4763","978-1-4244-4498-4","978-1-4244-4499-1","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977","","Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools","data handling;security of data","SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation","","1","","25","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns. Finally the experimental results show that this approach is feasible.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945304","alert correlation;attack scenario;causal knowledge;data mining","Correlation;Cyberspace;Data mining;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Markov processes;Sensors","Markov processes;data mining;matrix algebra;probability;security of data","APT detection;CEP;Markov property;advanced persistent threat detection;alert correlation analysis;attack scenarios;causal knowledge discovery;complex event processing;cyberspace security situation awareness;data mining;multistep attack processes;one step transition probability matrix;raw alert stream","","0","","21","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe advanced capabilities for mission-centric cyber situational awareness, based on defense in depth, provided by the Cauldron tool. Cauldron automatically maps all paths of vulnerability through networks, by correlating, aggregating, normalizing, and fusing data from a variety of sources.

The HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision. In the implementation, radial basis function model is used, because of its simplicity and its flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the soft decision based on the neural network, the robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. The efficiency of this method has been evaluated by the data set originated from New Mexico University.","","0-7803-8403-2","","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382325","","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Speech recognition;Text recognition","artificial intelligence;hidden Markov models;radial basis function networks;security of data","artificial intelligence tool;hard decision process;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;neural network model;profile database;radial basis function model","","1","","14","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the onset of gigabit networks, current generation networking components for NIDS will soon be insufficient for numerous reasons; most notably because the existing methods cannot support high-performance demands. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive medium to handle both high throughput and adaptability to the dynamic nature of intrusion detection. In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%. Moreover, using extensive pipelining and hardware parallelism, it can be shown that for realistic workloads, our architectures for FEM and outlier analysis achieve 21.25- and 23.76-Gb/s core throughput, respectively.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2007.916288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451089","Feature extraction;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);network intrusion detection system (NIDS);principal component analysis (PCA)","Adaptive arrays;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Software performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;feature extraction module;network administrator;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;outlier detection method;principal component analysis","","15","6","39","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed detection scheme is based on the application of Least Mean Square (LMS) filter and Pearson Chi-square divergence on randomly aggregated flows in Sketch data structure. Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions. We evaluate our approach using publicly available real IP traces (MAWI) collected from the WIDE backbone network, on trans-Pacific transit link between Japan and USA.

HonIDS is characterized by its layered structure and is enhanced by two detection models: TFRPP (times, frequency, range, port risk, average payload length) model and Bayes model. The basic idea of these models is that although it is hard to directly judge whether one interaction with the honeypots is an attack or malicious activity, it is possible to identify intruders by analyzing the plentiful and global events of honeypots in a given period of time. The TFRPP model gives the honeypot system the ability to assess different risks, by assigning dubiety scores to the hosts who visited honeypots.

In contrast to traditional research which only focuses on how to detect the scanning behavior, the binary model vector also concerns the response behavior of the worm host. Comparison results show that it can remarkably improve the integrality of description of unknown wormspsila propagation behavior.

The anomaly detection approaches can be classified into semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection. Unsupervised anomaly detection technique is the mainly approaches establish the profile of normal behavior with unlabeled training data that consists of both normal as well as anomalous samples. This paper uses the unsupervised K-MEANS algorithm to model and detect anomaly activities. The aim is to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. A K-MEANS algorithm based on information entropy (KMIE) is proposed to detect anomaly activities. KMIE can filter the outliers on the dataset to reduce the negative impact, and indentify the initial cluster centers using entropy method. Then, KMIE can use these centers to iterative calculate and classify records into different clusters. This paper uses KDD CUP 1999 dataset to test the performance of KMIE algorithm. The results show that our method has a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate, it achieves expectant aim.","","978-1-4673-3093-0","","10.1109/MINES.2012.169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405632","Anomaly Detection;Clustering Analysis;Information Entropy;K-MEANS","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Information entropy;Intrusion detection","entropy;security of data","KMIE algorithm;anomalous sample;anomaly activity detection;anomaly detection rate;false alarm rate;information entropy method;intrusion detection system;semisupervised;unlabeled training data;unsupervised K-MEANS algorithm;unsupervised anomaly detection","","0","","7","","","2-4 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

System calls and the operating system related information are used by host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) to detect intrusions towards a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, our proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925084","","Application software;Boosting;Computer crime;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Radio access networks;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","architecture level features;hardware architecture;network-based intrusion detection systems;operating system;sophisticated denial-of-service attack detections;statistical gradient boosting trees model","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FloTracker presents security administrators as well as automated response systems, with immediate forensics information. For instance, it will identify a system's entry point of intrusion as soon as a critical security incident occurs, e.g., a sensitive system file modification is detected within the target system. To this end, FloTracker automatically defines an access control policy set (possibly with no access restriction) for the target system that facilitates real-time backtracking of an intrusion, given a detection point. Our experimental results on a real-world SE-Linux test-bed showed that the FloTracker could efficiently update the system's configuration thus modifications will not affect the functionalities of the system, yet providing a log-free and instantaneous root-cause analysis capability.","","","","10.1109/PRDC.2013.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820872","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Software","authorisation;safety-critical software","FloTracker;access control policy set;automated response systems;forensics information;instantaneous forensics capabilities;intrusion diagnosis;log-free instantaneous host-based intrusion root-cause analysis;root-cause analysis detection engine;root-cause analysis techniques;security administrators;security incident;security-critical computer systems;system availability;system integrity","","0","","19","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regrettably, current solutions are far from perfect, since they either produce a large number of false positives or they can only detect already known attacks. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving IDS performance, i.e. achieving high detection while reducing false positives. In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level. We present an ontology-based approach to correlation, and describe how it can be implemented as a distributed, highly scalable system.

Accurate identification of P2P traffic makes great sense for efficient network management and reasonable utility of network resources. Application level classification of P2P traffic, especially without payload feature detection, is still a challenging problem. This paper proposes a new method for P2P traffic identification and application level classification, which merely uses transport layer information. The method uses support vector machines which have been optimized for performing large learning tasks, rendering that this method become more suitable for large network traffic. The experimental results show that this method achieved high efficiency and is suitable for real-time identification.

"An improved Hidden Markov Model for anomaly detection using frequent common patterns","Sultana, A.; Hamou-Lhadj, A.; Couture, M.","","Communications (ICC), 2012 IEEE International Conference on","20121129","2012","","","1113","1117","Host-based intrusion detection techniques are needed to ensure the safety and security of software systems, especially, if these systems handle sensitive data. Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527","Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior","","2","","30","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
