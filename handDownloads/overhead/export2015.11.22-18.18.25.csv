This paper proposes a framework to automatically build an effective online IDS which can check if the program's expected behavior is respected during the execution. The proposed framework extracts relevant information from the program's source code to build a dedicated IDS. We use the GCC compiler to produce the structure of our behavior's model and ensure the IDS is correct.

Although numerous intrusion detection systems are available, yet it is not practical to install IDS in every virtual machine. In this paper, we argue that a virtual machine monitor (VMM) can support certain security functions that our proposed design can actively collect information directly from the VMM without installing an agent in the guest OS. In addition, bot could not aware of the existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and active detection approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the active detection agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates. Also, the result shows the active detection agent can detect a bot even when before it performs its malicious jobs. The proposed mechanism suites an enterprise having cloud environment well to defeat malware.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682703","bot;fingerprinting;hypervisor;intrusion detection","Conferences;Detectors;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","IDS;VMM;active bot fingerprinting;active detection approaches;bot behavior profiles;cloud security;cooperative botnet detection;cooperative botnet profiling;enterprise;guest OS;malicious jobs;malware;passive detection approaches;virtual machine monitor;virtualized environment","","0","","22","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses the issue of D-NCS information security as well its real-time performance with respect to network security protocols and encryption schemes. We use a wireless network based, robot navigation path tracking system called intelligent space (iSpace) as a D-NCS test bed in this paper. The paper classifies the data from every NCS module (sensors, actuators and controllers) according to bandwidth requirement, time and information sensitivity. We define performance parameters for this NCS test bed. Various system factors affecting these performance parameters are recognized. Network security algorithms DES and 3DES are integrated with the application to encrypt the sensitive information flow. These wireless security features are considered as an added factor to the NCS. Standard statistical approach (2<sup>k</sup> factorial experiment design) is used to study and estimate the effect of each factor on the system performance especially security additions. Thorough experimental results, tables of detailed characterization and effect estimate analysis is presented followed by the discussion on the performance comparison of NCS with and without wireless security.","1553-572X","1-4244-0783-4","","10.1109/IECON.2007.4460391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4460391","Distributed networked-control-system;data security;data-sensitive wireless network;iSpace","Actuators;Communication system security;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Intelligent robots;Intelligent sensors;Next generation networking;Space technology;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;distributed control;navigation;radio networks;real-time systems;robots;statistical analysis","distributed network-control-system;encryption scheme;information security;network security protocol;real-time application;robot navigation path tracking system;statistical approach;wireless network","","6","","12","","","5-8 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario. Virtual hosts were automatically configured with unique emulated network stack behaviors for 92% of the targeted devices.

The paper analyses the requirements of ISP-operated intrusion prevention systems and presents our approach for an IPS that runs on top of an active networking environment and is automatically configured by a vulnerability scanner. We call the system FIDRAN (Flexible Intrusion Detection and Response framework for Active Networks). The system autonomously analyses the home network and correspondingly configures the IPS. Furthermore, our system detects and adjusts itself to changes in the home network (new service, new host, etc.). First performance comparisons show that our approach - while offering more flexibility and being able to support continuous updating by active networking principles - competes well with the performance of conventional intrusion prevention systems like Snort-Inline.","","0-7803-8145-9","","10.1109/CCNC.2004.1286830","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286830","","Cable TV;Communication cables;DSL;Home automation;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protection;Software quality;Technology management;Web and internet services","Internet;computer crime;home computing;telecommunication security","ISP-operated intrusion prevention systems;Internet service providers;Snort-Inline;active networks;flexible intrusion detection;gateway;home network protection;network security;vulnerability scanner","","1","","12","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e.g., HTTP, FTP) communications between hosts. These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections that can be used to help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied predominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on ""traditional"" graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85% of the hosts examined across seven protocols.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425781","","Application software;Cryptography;Data security;Information security;Length measurement;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FTP;HTTP;application graphs;application protocols;encrypted protocols;k-nearest neighbor classifier;motif-based analysis;network motifs;network resources;network traffic","","1","","21","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DFM is scalable and simple to implement, it is capable of tracing thousands of simultaneous distributed attacks in near real time.

Such openness makes them likely targets for intruders, and conventional protection techniques have been shown insufficient to prevent all intrusions in such open systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture to implement intrusion-tolerant Web servers. This architecture is based on redundancy and diversification principles in order to increase the system resilience to attacks: usually, an attack targets a particular software, running on a particular platform, and fails on others. The architecture is composed of redundant proxies that mediate client requests to a redundant bank of diversified application servers. The redundancy is deployed here to increase system availability and integrity. To improve performance, adaptive redundancy is applied: the redundancy level is selected according to the current alert level. The architecture can be used for static servers, that is, for Web distribution of stable information (updated offline) and for fully dynamic systems where information updates are executed immediately on an online database. The feasibility of this architecture has been demonstrated by implementing an example of a travel agency Web server, and the first performance tests are satisfactory, both for request execution times and recovery after incidents.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2008.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4429182","Security;Web servers;and protection;integrity","","Internet;client-server systems;data integrity;fault tolerant computing;file servers;open systems;redundancy;security of data","Internet;Web interface;Web server;adaptive redundancy;client-server system;data integrity;diversification principle;information system;intrusion-tolerant architecture;open system;system availability","","12","","27","","2008-02-02","Jan.-March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, the constrained capacity of their batteries and the energy inefficiency inherent to the ad hoc communication poses a challenge causing a short lifetime. Protocols and application layer services, such as security, can be designed (offline) to do an efficient use of the resources. Realtime adaptation can further minimise their impact on the energy consumption, increasing the network lifetime thus extending the availability of network communication. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware adaption component for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The component is in charge of adjusting the parameters of the IDS based on the current energy level, using the trade-off between the node's response to attacks and the energy consumption induced by the IDS. The approach is based on a model for accounting CPU energy consumption in network simulation, which has been implemented in an existing IDS in ns-3. Simulations demonstrate that the adaption has a positive impact on the battery life time, increasing it by 14%, without deteriorating the network-wide performance of the IDS.","2156-9711","978-1-4577-2027-7","978-1-4577-2026-0","10.1109/WD.2011.6098216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098216","Adaptation;CPU model;energy modelling;energy-awareness;intrusion detection;survivability","Ad hoc networks;Adaptation models;Batteries;Energy consumption;Power demand;Protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile handsets;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network reliability","CPU energy consumption;IDS;MANET;NS3 simulation;application layer service;attack node response;energy inefficiency;energy-aware adaption component;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless handheld device;network communication availability;network lifetime;protocol;survivability simulation","","1","","27","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We implement an FPGA based sub-system for NIDS (Snort) pattern matching using a combination of techniques. First, we reduce the area cost of character matching using (i) character pre-decoding before they are compared in the CAM line, and (ii) efficient shift register implementation using the SRL16 Xilinx cell. Then we achieve high operating frequencies by (iii) using ne grain pipelining for faster circuits and (iv) decoupling the data distribution network from the processing components. Our results show that for matching more than 18,000 characters (the entire SNORT rule set) our implementation requires an area cost of less than 1.1 logic cells per matched character, achieving an operating frequency of about 375 MHz (3 Gbps) on a Virtex2 device. When using quad parallelism to increase the matching throughput, the area cost of a single matched character is reduced to less than one logic cell for a throughput of almost 10 Gbps.","","0-7695-2230-0","","10.1109/FCCM.2004.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1364636","","CADCAM;Cams;Computer aided manufacturing;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Logic devices;Pattern matching;Throughput","content-addressable storage;decoding;field programmable gate arrays;memory architecture;security of data;shift registers;string matching","CAM based pattern matching;FPGA based subsystem;SRL16 Xilinx cell;Snort rule set;Virtex2 device;character matching;character predecoding;data distribution network;faster circuits;grain pipelining;network intrusion detection system;predecoded CAM;processing components;shift register","","84","2","16","","","20-23 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While such implementations, capable of handling lower protocol layers, have been extensively studied in research and industry, their extension to higher communication layers has only rarely been addressed. Such capabilities, including the application level (OSI Layer 7), are the focus of this work. We present the NetStage platform, employing reconfigurable computing for high-throughput low-latency network processing, as well as associated development tools that allow networking domain experts to easily customize the system.

This paper focuses on a hybrid approach for intrusion detection system (IDS) based on data mining techniques. The main research method is clustering analysis with the aim to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. Most of the previously proposed methods suffer from the drawback of k-means method with low detection rate and high false alarm rate. This paper presents a hybrid data mining approach encompassing feature selection, filtering, clustering, divide and merge and clustering ensemble. A method for calculating the number of the cluster centroid and choosing the appropriate initial cluster centroid is proposed in this paper.

However, these approaches intrinsically suffer from the high overhead to communicate with their external devices. Consequently, they either significantly lose performance, or inevitably make invasive modifications to the processor inside. Our solution also rely on external hardware for DIFT, but unlike theirs, ours exploits the core debug interface (CDI) to tackle the communication issue. CDI is provided in most commercial processors for debugging so that we were able to build our system simply by plugging our hardware to the processor via CDI, precluding the need for altering the processor itself. Experiments show that our hardware efficiently performs DIFT mainly thanks to the support of CDI that helps us cut substantially down the communication costs.","","","","10.1145/2744769.2744830","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167263","Core Debug Interface;Dynamic Information Flow Tracking","Computer architecture;Cryptography;Engines;Hardware;Kernel;Registers;Runtime","computer debugging;microprocessor chips;software reliability","CDI;DIFT;core debug interface;dynamic information flow tracking;internal processor architecture","","0","","21","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, we may adapt for less accuracy in order to gain speed for both with and/or without parallel processing techniques. We also construct an adaptive learning algorithm to update the model.

Thus the behavior based monitoring is used to avoid malicious code in window system. Some of them hook high level system APIs to detect the suspicious behavior of the code. Thus this cannot detect malicious code that directly invokes the native APIs. Thus a security scheme is used, that hooks native APIs in the kernel mode. It provides authentication of the system service caller in the kernel mode. So it prevents the malicious code calling native API directly. To provide extra authentication the dispatch ID is scrambled. For the scrambling to take place first the dispatch ID is distinguished as local ID and remote ID and then the filter is used to find the legitimate user. Next the scrambling is done with that legitimate user ID. The unscrambling is done to get the original dispatch ID only if it is a legitimate user.

Routing protocol in MANET operates on the basic assumption that nodes are fully cooperative. Because of open infrastructure and limited battery power some nodes may not cooperate correctly. These nodes start refusing to forward data packets or drop them thereby degrades the performance of network. So it is very essential to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to prevent MANET from attacks. The IDS Watchdog, fails to detect node misbehavior in the presence of ambiguous collisions, receiver collisions, limited transmission power, false misbehavior, collusion and partial dropping. An intrusion detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) has been developed which consists of three parts, namely, ACK, Secure ACK (S-ACK), and Misbehavior Report Authentication (MRA). All the acknowledgement packets are digitally signed and verified to prevent forged acknowledgement packets. For signing and verifying the acknowledgement packets, keys are generated and distributed in advance. The proposed system uses One-hop ACK which is used to improve misbehavior detection rates. Basic drawback of S-ACK includes it cannot distinguish exactly which particular node is misbehaving node. Sometime well behaving nodes became a part of misbehaving link. Thus lot of well behaved node may be avoided by network which results in losing of well behaved routes. To eliminate the requirement of predistributed keys proposed system considers Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm.","","978-1-4799-2321-2","","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892733","Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm;EAACK;IDS;MANET","Classification algorithms;Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Random access memory;Routing","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data","Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm;EAACK;IDS Watchdog;MANET;MRA;S-ACK;acknowledgement packets;ambiguous collisions;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;intrusion detection system;misbehavior report authentication;mobile ad hoc network;mobile nodes;node misbehavior detection;one-hop ACK;receiver collisions;routing protocol;secure ACK;wireless links","","1","","9","","","13-14 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus any unauthorized wireless hosts found indicate the presence of a RWAP. With these session-based temporal characteristics, traffic from wireless and wired nodes can be differentiated by exploiting the fundamental differences between Ethernet and 802.11b/g/n. In this work, we empirically analyzed extensive LRTT data and designed a light system - RAPiD with several algorithms for effective wireless hosts detection. Ultimately, SYN, FIN, and ACK LRTTs can be compared against each other to discover wireless hosts regardless of network speeds.

It is important to design new approaches and mechanisms to rise the security these networks and protect them from attacks. In this paper, we design an intrusion detection mechanism for the VANETs using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

One of the researches introduced a fast method to detect attacks using modified information entropy (so called Fast Entropy). Fast Entropy shows the significant reduce of computational time compared to conventional entropy computation while it maintains detection accuracy. However, Fast Entropy needs the manual threshold settings during detection process which is not realistic in real detection facility. We introduce adaptive detector with dynamic detection window size and adaptive threshold shifting using Fast Entropy, called AFEA (Adaptive DDoS attack detection using Fast Entropy Approach). Our adaptive DDoS detector successfully demonstrates that its performance of the DDoS detection can be enhanced by the best result of Fast Entropy detection scheme without manual threshold setting and system training while it maintains the same computational time of Fast Entropy detection scheme. In addition, we found that Dynamic AFEA can enhance detection level more than fixed (non-dynamic) one when it is equipped with Fast Entropy.","","978-1-61284-733-7","978-0-7695-4372-7","10.1109/IMIS.2011.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976144","DDoS;Dynamic Adaptive Detector;Entropy based approach;Fast Infromatin Entropy","Accuracy;Computer crime;Detectors;Entropy;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring","Internet;entropy;security of data","Internet;adaptive DDoS attack detection using fast entropy approach;adaptive threshold shifting;distributed denial-of-service attacks;dynamic detection window size","","1","","11","","","June 30 2011-July 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors. Moreover, unlike most IDSs, most of the thresholds in SAHN-IDS are set dynamically. We show the effectiveness of SAHN-IDS through simulations.","","0-7803-9311-2","","10.1109/TENCON.2005.300979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085224","","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Degradation;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;directive antennas;telecommunication security;wireless channels","anomaly detection;directional antennas;frequency channels;intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;suburban ad-hoc networks;transmission channel;transmission power","","1","","22","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25&nbsp; 000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","DPI;Deep packet inspection;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;NIDPS;network intrusion detection and prevention system;regular expressions","Automata;Complexity theory;Correlation;Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Timing","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","FPGA chip;LaFA;RegEx detection systems;bit rate 34 Gbit/s;deep packet inspection;lookahead finite automata;network intrusion detection;per-character-state processing;scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;single-commodity field programmable gate array;state transition detection;suboptimal character-based detection method","","4","","34","","2012-01-18","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By implementing multiple aircraft in an assessment configuration, aerial monitoring and diverse sensing can be accomplished through the use of ad-hoc networking principles; aircraft act as nodes, each being a distributed agent in the network. Combined with a method called the Distributed Apt Resource Transference System (DARTS) for reallocating redundant or alternately-allocatable resources, such implementations can enjoy longer operational duration, increased coverage, and a higher probability of executing the desired reconnaissance. DARTS employs a hybridization of gossip and flooding-based resource discovery methods to find suitable replacement resources in the case of a node failure. Failures may arise due to natural (environmental) interference or malicious attacks designed to disrupt the mission. Testing of the fault-tolerant resource management techniques demonstrated resiliency of the system, resulting in minimal bandwidth requirements to reallocate (up to 6-fold reduction in traffic) and a faster speed of resource reallocation (up to 79% improvement), even in the face of an inconsistent state of operation. By implementing intrusion detection system (IDS) technologies to spawn the reallocation process (a procedure called triggering), DARTS provides a flexible, lightweight, and scalable method to efficiently allow reconnaissance and other distributed sensing applications to occur on a mobile, airborne platform.","2155-7578","978-1-4244-8178-1","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5679552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679552","","Aircraft;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Sensors","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;security of data","ad hoc network;distributed agent;distributed apt resource transference system;distributed sensing method;fault tolerant distributed reconnaissance;flooding based resource discovery method;intrusion detection system;resource management;resource reallocation","","3","","16","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover these types of network can be easily constructed whenever and wherever required. It offers plenty of applications, it also has its own weaknesses that are disturbing the network from a security perspective. In order to do the data transmission successfully, each node should trust other while forwarding node that is ensuring authentication to the receiver by the way of cooperating with each other. But achieving such cooperation in this distinct environment is too difficult. Though traditional cryptographic methods are there they are pre-determined, hence assumption is not always practical in dynamic network.

We propose novel approaches for storage-based intrusion detection and discuss how features of state-of-the-art block storage systems can be used for intrusion detection and recovery of compromised data. In particular we present two prototype systems. First we present a real time intrusion detection system (IDS), which has been integrated within a storage management and virtualization system. In this system incoming requests for storage blocks are examined for signs of intrusions in real time. We then discuss how intrusion detection schemes can be deployed as an appliance loosely coupled with a SAN storage system. The major advantage of this approach is that it does not require any modification and enhancement to the storage system software. In this approach, we use the space and time efficient point-in-time copy operation provided by SAN storage devices.

While these needs are traditionally provided through methods of channel encryption and signing, such mechanisms are often difficult or impossible to implement in the ad-hoc, decentralized environments seen in sensor networks, collaborative intrusion detection systems, or other similar peer-to-peer networks. Using the concepts from one-way hashing and language-derived relevance theory, we propose five novel contributions relevant to ad-hoc communications and security: one-way cryptographic hashing as a mechanism for securely communicating in an environment where preexisting shared knowledge exists, hashed shared knowledge messages as a basis for secure formation of self-selecting subgroups and trust building, adding salt to the shared knowledge hashes to remove the static nature of common messages and defend against precomputed table attacks, integration of variable complexity hash functions to dynamically adjust hash complexity relative to message complexity, and a message integrity element based on the secrecy of the original shared knowledge within a hashed message. Although our proposed mechanisms are likely implemented without difficulty from a network and encryption standpoint, they do require significant integration and awareness within the applications relying on them. The method also assumes a static value from a large existing set of shared knowledge, which does not always exist.","","978-1-4577-0980-7","978-0-7695-4459-5","10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032224","hashing;secure communications;shared knowledge","Ad hoc networks;Complexity theory;Encryption;Knowledge engineering;Receivers","ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security","ad-hoc communication;ad-hoc environment;ad-hoc security;channel encryption;channel signing;collaborative intrusion detection system;complexity hash function;decentralized communication network;language-derived relevance theory;message complexity;message confidentiality;message integrity;message-based communication network;one-way cryptographic hashing mechanism;one-way hashing;peer-to-peer network;salted hash;secure communication;sensor network","","1","","29","","","18-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","1","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs, which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name used by common DFA encoding is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state are represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Match (LPM), which can be solved either in ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM), in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gb/s with low power consumption.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2253119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494357","Aho–Corasick (AC);IP lookup;deep packet inspection;network intrusion detection system (NIDS);pattern matching;ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)","","IP networks;encoding;energy consumption;pattern matching;security of data","DFA encoding;IDS;IP-lookup chips;LPM;TCAM;contemporary intrusion detection systems;degree of freedom;deterministic finite automaton;longest prefix match solutions;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms;ternary content-addressable memory","","1","","34","","2013-04-04","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users' behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users' behaviors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they are two of the most important components of mobile users' profiles. To utilize users' calling activities, we formulate the intrusion detection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and call destination are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users' calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model integrating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users' movement patterns. A user's movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users' current movement activities. We simulate users' various behaviors and provide simulation results.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2007.901875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4356991","Bayes decision rule;Bayesian decision rule;instance based learning;instance-based learning (IBL);intrusion detection;wireless network","","belief networks;cellular radio;mobile radio;radio access networks;safety systems;security of data","Bayesian decision rule;Gaussian kernel;Parzen window;cellular mobile systems;class conditional probability density function;fraudulent usage;intrusion detection system;mobile telecommunication services;wireless networks","","6","","27","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To minimize energy consumption and improve network lifetime, this paper presents a lightweight XOR based Key Freshness Scheme (XKFS), which allows refreshing the key without inter node message transmission. A single message containing a magic word is transmitted by the group head to its member nodes and keys are refreshed using XOR and left shift operations. XKFS only requires a light weight message from a more powerful head node and thus eliminates the inter node communication cost. The performance of the XKFS is validated through simulations.

However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector.

Amongst many potential aspects of investigation, one has been the design of a secure routing protocol in which a value sensed to be delivered to an appropriate receiver securely and efficiently with least amount of energy consumption. We observe that LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a popular clustering based protocol used in WSNs. However, the same lacks any security support. Amongst numerous improvements of LEACH suggested to incorporate security & privacy, we observe that none, to the best of our knowledge offers end-to-end privacy using the homomorphic encryption schemes. We propose here an improvement of LEACH viz. E-LEACH (end-to-end secure LEACH) which uses homomorphic encryption to provide secure data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks. Due to the algebraic characteristics in homomorphic encryption, data can be algebraically aggregated without decryption and hence require least amount of energy, while ensuring privacy.","","978-1-4799-6499-4","","10.1109/ICIINFS.2014.7036607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036607","Clustering;Homomorphic Encryption;LEACH;Secure Data Aggregation","Base stations;Encryption;Routing protocols;Steady-state;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;energy consumption;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","E-LEACH;WSN;clustering based protocol;end-to-end privacy;end-to-end secure LEACH;energy consumption;homomorphic encryption schemes;low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;pervasive computing paradigm;receiver securely;resource constrained characteristic;secure data aggregation;secure routing protocol;ubiquitous computing paradigm;wireless sensor networks","","0","","16","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a bid to address these evolving requirements we have prototyped a hybrid firewall, using a simple firewall running on a network processor to accelerate a Linux* Netfilter Firewall executing on a general purpose processor. The simple firewall on the network processor provides high rate packet processing for all the packets while the general-purpose processor delivers high rate, full featured firewall processing for those packets that need it. This paper describes the hybrid firewall prototype with a focus on the software created to accelerate Netfilter with a network processor resident firewall. Measurements show our hybrid firewall able to maintain close to 2 Gb/sec line rate for all packet sizes, a significant improvement over the original firewall.

This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic.

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. As part of an overall strategy for network resilience, a crucial requirement is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a novel solution that enables the progressive multi-stage deployment of resilience strategies, based on incomplete challenge and context information. Policies are used to orchestrate the interactions between various resilience mechanisms, which incrementally identify the nature of a challenge and deploy appropriate remediation mechanisms. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach via simulation of a resource starvation attack on an Internet Service Provider infrastructure. By initially using lightweight detection and then progressively applying more heavyweight analysis, a key contribution of our work is the ability to mitigate a challenge as early as possible and rapidly detect its root cause.

In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster based anomaly detection scheme by assigning few randomly chosen cluster heads a critical task of estimating the reliability of the mobile beacon node. As localization of remaining nodes is cautiously performed only after verifying the authenticity of the mobile beacon node, a considerable overhead is saved in the incorrect localization of the entire network.

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","1533-2306","978-1-4577-1118-3","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","13","","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. However, current high volumes of network traffic overwhelm most IDS techniques requiring new approaches that are able to handle huge volume of log and packet analysis while still maintaining high throughput. Hadoop, an open-source computing platform of MapReduce and a distributed file system, has become a popular infrastructure for massive data analytics because it facilitates scalable data processing and storage services on a distributed computing system consisting of commodity hardware. The proposed architecture is able to efficiently handle large volumes of collected data and consequent high processing loads using Hadoop, MapReduce and cloud computing infrastructure. The main focus of the paper is to enhance the throughput and scalability of the IDS Log analysis. Once enough data is gathered, it is necessary to rapidly analyze it and determine whether any attacks or malicious activities are present, which is the main issue that impacts IDS performance.","","978-1-4799-1594-1","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724158","Cloud Computing;Hadoop File System;Intrusion Detection System;MapReduce","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Computers;File systems;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;security of data","Hadoop;IDS;IDS monitors network traffic;cloud computing infrastructure;computer systems;data analytics;data processing;distributed computing system;distributed file system;malicious activities;malicious attacks;network administrator;network environment security;network security;open-source computing platform;scalable intrusion detection systems log analysis;storage services;suspicious activity","","1","","11","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rather, they follow probabilistic models. Yet, many current connectivity maintenance protocols assume the disk communication model for convenience and ease of analysis. In addition, current protocols do not provide any assessment of the quality of communication between nodes. In this paper, we take a first step in designing connectivity maintenance protocols for more realistic communication models. We propose a distributed connectivity maintenance protocol that explicitly accounts for the probabilistic nature of communication links and achieves a given target communication quality between nodes. Our protocol is simple to implement, and we demonstrate its robustness against random node failures, inaccuracy of node locations, and imperfect time synchronization of nodes using extensive simulations. We compare our protocol against others in the literature and show that it activates fewer number of nodes, consumes much less energy, and significantly prolongs the network lifetime.","","978-1-4244-1454-3","978-1-4244-1455-0","10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4428600","","Computer networks;Lattices;Performance analysis;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","failure analysis;maintenance engineering;probability;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","connectivity maintenance protocols;disk communication model;distributed connectivity maintenance protocol;network connectivity;node failures;probabilistic communication models;time synchronization;wireless sensor networks","","5","","25","","","8-11 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In DPI the packet payload is compared against a set of predefined patterns which can be specified using regular expressions (regexes). It is well-known that mapping regexes to deterministic finite automata (DFA) will suffer from the state explosion problem. Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided. Further, it achieves a fully automated signature compilation with polynomial running time and space.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501976","","Automata;Communications Society;Counting circuits;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;History;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Polynomials","","","","1","1","14","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"How dynamic is the ISPs address space? Towards internet-wide DHCP churn estimation","Moura, G.C.M.; Ganan, C.; Lone, Q.; Poursaied, P.; Asghari, H.; van Eeten, M.","Delft Univ. of Technol., Delft, Netherlands","IFIP Networking Conference (IFIP Networking), 2015","20150702","2015","","","1","9","IP address counts are typically used as a surrogate metric for the number of hosts in a network, as in the case of ISP rankings based on botnet infected addresses. However, due to effects of dynamic IP address allocation, such counts tend to overestimate the number of hosts, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In the literature, the rate at which hosts change IP addresses is referred to as DHCP churn. Churn rates vary significantly within and among ISP networks, and such variation poses a challenge to any research that relies upon IP addresses as a metric. We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric. We propose an scalable active measurement methodology and then validate it using ground truth data from a medium-sized ISP. Next, we build a statistical model to estimate DHCP churn rates and validate against the ground truth data of the same ISP, estimating correctly 72.3% of DHCP churn rates. Finally, we apply our measurement methodology to four major ISPs, triangulate the results to another Internet census, and discuss the next steps to more precisely estimate DHCP churn rates.","","","","10.1109/IFIPNetworking.2015.7145335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7145335","","IP networks;Measurement uncertainty;Probes;Protocols;Servers;Time measurement","IP networks;Internet;invasive software","DHCP churn rate;ISP address space;ISP network;ISP ranking;Internet census;Internet-wide DHCP churn estimation;botnet infected address;churn rates;dynamic IP address allocation;ground truth data;scalable active measurement methodology;surrogate metric","","0","","34","","","20-22 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper mainly focuses on reducing the problem of false alarm rate, using semantic based system call patterns. Here, we make use of the semantic approach to apply on the underlying kernel level system calls which can help understand the anomaly behavior. The semantic tool used is the data dictionary. The data dictionary containing every possible combinations of sequence of system call names of particular phrase length was constructed. The features satisfying the semantic hypothesis are extracted and then normalized. The normalized values are then given as input to the decision engine.

The new method is based on the inherent feature of the TCP protocol, that is, two communicating peers keep synchronized with each other using data acknowledgment. This feature is converted as a balance mechanism in interactive TCP traffic replay and incorporated into the current state-based method. In this way, the cost of state-checking can be significantly reduced and the replay performance is thus enhanced. To validate the effectiveness of the method we implement it by building an interactive replay system. The experimental results indicate that: 1) balance-checking reduces the overhead of state-checking by 40%; 2) the balance-based method enhances the overall replay performance by an average of 5% when the actual TCP traffic traces are replayed.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501960","","Communication system traffic control;Communications Society;Costs;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","","","","1","","17","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
