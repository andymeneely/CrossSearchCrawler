This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations. In addition, the anomaly detection algorithm achieved a 99.9% recognition rate. All output from the modules were correctly distributed using the common communication structure.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2013.2270373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547755","Autonomic computing;control systems;industrial ecosystems;network security;service-oriented architecture","","access protocols;computer network security;fault tolerant computing;field buses;fuzzy logic;industrial control;intelligent sensors;meta data;network interfaces;pattern clustering","C++;IF-MAP;PERL;SOAP-based interface;anomaly detection algorithm;autonomic computing;autonomic intelligent cyber-sensor;digital device proliferation;flexible two-level communication layer;fuzzy logic;industrial control network awareness;internal D-Bus communication mechanism;legacy software;metadata access point external communication layer;mixed-use test network;network security sensor;networked industrial ecosystem;proof of concept prototype;self-managed framework;service oriented architecture;simple object access protocol-based interface;traffic monitor;virtual network hosts","","4","1","29","","2013-06-26","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed detection engine is deployed at each node and performs detection using a set of specifications, which describe the correct operation of the MAC protocol operating at the host node. The proposed engine introduces a number of significant advantages since it can effectively detect both known and unknown attacks in real time and with minimum overhead.

IEEE","20070529","2007","","","1289","1297","Third generation (3G) wireless networks based on the CDMA2000 and UMTS standards are now increasingly being deployed throughout the world. Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735","","3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation","","18","1","28","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system that shares normal behavior data between multiple machines. In the proposed system, normal behavior data obtained on each machine is accumulated in a server and the integrated data is distributed to each machine.This system improves the detection accuracy by integrating the data used for anomaly detection on each machine.

In this regard, we present a low-complexity recomputing with rotated operands-based scheme which is a step-forward toward reducing the hardware overhead of the proposed error detection approach. Moreover, we perform injection-based fault simulations and show that the error coverage of close to 100% is derived. Furthermore, we have designed the proposed scheme and through ASIC analysis, it is shown that acceptable complexity and performance overheads are reached.

However uneven network flow size are being increased for retaining the packet order in each flow and the existing parallel processing model is basic unit for partition the workload which cannot be quite advantage of multicore platform, therefore it creates low CPU utilization and increasing number of CPU in the network. For overcome this problem we present in this paper we proposed a novel parallel processing inspection model which is called CMRDS (Centralized multiple robust distribution system). This implies balanced parallel detection by adding multiple dimensions on pattern matching workload division from various different types of nodes. CMRDS allows multiple pattern matching algorithm and creates simultaneously different pattern set and handle variable pattern length efficiently for packet inspection is completed in O(N log M) and N is the size of the packet M is the longest packet length inspect packet for optimizing flow in the different network. According to this algorithm subset divisions are descended in the packet for maximum use of core utilization and avoiding unnecessary overhead.

Regular expressions are one method to implement such matching and are often built in FPGAs using non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs). To obtain high throughputs it is necessary to process many bytes in parallel. This paper extends the modular NFA construction method of Sidhu and Prasanna to handle the processing of many bytes in parallel. The paper also introduces the concept of partial character decoding in which character match units are shared but the number of signals needed to be routed around the FPGA is reduced over previous shared-decoder approaches. With these approaches, throughput over 5Gbps is achieved for the full default Snort rule-set (23401 literals) in a Xilinx Virtex-2 6000 FPGA. Throughputs over 40Gbps are achieved on smaller rule-sets.

This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process.

In this work, we have taken up these two security issues in a DTN based on an architecture suitable for Post disaster scenario, where mobile nodes move around a fixed destination and communicate messages to it. A co-operative scheme is presented to reduce the harmful effects of these malicious nodes in the network. The cooperation is obtained from the neighbouring nodes. The malicious behavior of a node is examined at the time of sending messages to that node by inquiring other neighbouring nodes about the past performances of that node. Simple parameters, such as total number of sent and received messages to and from other nodes and the elapsed time since the network is active, are used for arriving at the decision of forwarding messages to that node. The node whose malicious behavior is being tested is not involved in the whole process as it may manipulate information to pose as a valid node. By the cooperation of other neighbouring nodes, a combined faith value (CFV) is calculated. If this value satisfies a pre-defined threshold condition, then the node is treated as valid for that moment. The process is performed every time a node wants to transmit a message to another node. Also, the calculated CFV is multicast in the neighbourhood for updating. The scheme has been tested on the Spray and Wait (S&W) DTN routing protocol with mobile nodes and fixed destination type architecture to prove its effectiveness. It is found to avoid malicious nodes and increase the trustiness of the network and data communication.","","","","10.1109/EAIT.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052032","Black-hole;DTN Security;Delay Tolerant Network;Faith value;Post Disaster Situation;Selfish node","Delays;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;TV","data communication;delay tolerant networks;electronic messaging;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security;trusted computing","CFV;S&W DTN routing protocol;black-hole attack;combined faith value;cooperative approach;data communication;delay tolerant network security threats;message forwarding;message sending;mobile network node trust;post disaster scenario;spray and wait DTN routing protocol;thwart selfish attack","","0","","18","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging as a prevailing technology due to its wide range of applications in military and civilian domains. These networks are easily prone to security attacks, since once deployed these networks are unattended and unprotected. Some of the inherent features like limited battery and low memory make sensor networks incompatible with conventional security solutions, which need complex computations and high memory. Selective forwarding attack is one of the harmful attacks against sensor networks and can affect the whole sensor network communication. In such an attack compromised nodes drop packets selectively, which may deteriorate the network efficiency. In this paper multipath routing scheme is used as defense mechanism against selective forwarding attack. When a node detects packet drop during the routing, it will resend the packet through alternate route. Due to the resending mechanism reliability of the routing scheme is improved.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726833","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Reliability;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","defense mechanism;multipath routing;packet drop detection;routing reliability;security attack;selective forwarding attack;selective packet dropping;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings","20030225","2002","2","","1503","1508 vol.2","Traditional intrusion detection systems can be broadly classified as misuse and anomaly detectors. Misuse detectors attempt detection by matching the current system/user activity against known signatures and patterns. As opposed to this, anomaly detection works by developing a reference graph and comparing the ongoing activity against it. Any significant deviation is flagged as an intrusion. Anomaly detection is more promising because of its potential to detect unseen types of attacks. However, both techniques have conventionally relied on audit trails sampled deep inside the system via probes and the sheer size of the data allows only after-the-fact and off line detection. In recent past, there have been efforts to capture the semantics of system activity for more rapid detection and this can typically be done at levels closer to the user. In our earlier works related to this effort, we presented a scheme and a reasoning framework to detect intrusions based on the encapsulated user intent. This paper addresses the scalability and implementation aspects of the system by introducing concepts such as workspaces and meta-operations. Although this security system is a general anomaly detection system, it is amenable to operator fault recovery. While encryption provides secure communication channels, it leaves the end points exposed. Our security system has the additional capability of handling insider attacks relevant in this context.","","0-7803-7625-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179706","","Communication channels;Communication system security;Context;Cryptography;Detectors;Fault detection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Probes;Scalability","computer network management;graphs;military communication;military computing;telecommunication security","encapsulated user intent;exposed end points;insider attacks;meta-operations;operator fault recovery;reasoning framework;reference graph;scalable implementation;user level anomaly detection system;workspaces","","3","","31","","","7-10 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%.

Such networks are more vulnerable to both internal and external attacks due to presence of bad neighbor nodes. Observed problem affects performance of routing protocol in adhoc networks. In this paper, impact of bad neighbor nodes in adhoc routing is briefly discussed and proposed a method (GNDA) for identifying good neighbor nodes in the network. Besides, this approach is extended by adding extra parameters i.e. signal strength, flow capacity and relative position of a node in to the account.

Significant research efforts have been made to address the problem of misbehavior detection. However, little research work has been done to distinguish truly malicious behaviors from the faulty behaviors. Both the malicious behaviors and the faulty behaviors are generally equally treated as misbehaviors without any further investigation by most of the traditional misbehavior detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose and develop a policy-based malicious peer detection mechanism, in which context information, such as communication channel status, buffer status, and transmission power level, is collected and then used to determine whether the misbehavior is likely a result of malicious activity or not. Simulation results illustrate that the policy-based malicious peer detection mechanism is able to distinguish malicious peers from faulty peers with high confidence.

Hence, exploring and addressing the problems have become one of the most urgent issues in parallel IDS. In this work, an IDS model adopting software pipeline is developed as the test bed of parallel performance evaluation. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we explore the performance of parallel IDS through substantive experiments and quantitative analyses. We find Heavy Rule Fingerprint (HRF) in the pre-filter, which has not been mentioned in previous papers as we know, causes severe performance deterioration mentioned in existing studies. The experiments illustrate that the time consumption on HRF in parallel system is at least 6-7 times longer than that in normal system. Second, we propose a new fingerprint extraction strategy to deal with HRF. Experimental results show that the throughput deterioration is resolved completely and the throughput is enhanced by 45% by integrating our proposed method into the test bed and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4577-2135-9","","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120879","Intrusion Detection System;Snort;multi-core;pre-fliter;software pipeline","","","","","0","","20","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HIDSs cannot perform a network-wide analysis and can be subverted if a host is compromised. We propose an approach to intrusion detection that combines HIDS, NIDS, and a version of IPsec that encrypts the header and the body of IP packets separately (""Two-Zone IPsec""). We show that all of the network events currently detectable by the Snort NIDS on unencrypted network traffic are also detectable on encrypted network traffic using this approach.

Many recent new services are based on cloud environments, and a lot of people are using cloud networks. Since many diverse hosts and network configurations coexist in a cloud network, it is essential to protect each of them in the cloud network from threats. To do this, basically, we can employ existing network security devices, but applying them to a cloud network requires more considerations for its complexity, dynamism, and diversity. In this paper, we propose a new framework, CloudWatcher, which provides monitoring services for large and dynamic cloud networks. This framework automatically detours network packets to be inspected by pre-installed network security devices. In addition, all these operations can be implemented by writing a simple policy script, thus, a cloud network administrator is able to protect his cloud network easily.

It classifies network traffic based on information hidden in the packet payload. Although the computationally intensive payload classification can be accelerated with multiple processors, the default OS scheduler is oblivious to both the software characteristics and the underlying multicore architecture. In this paper, we present a parallelized L7-filter algorithm and an efficient scheduler technique for multicore servers. Our multithreaded L7-filter algorithm can process the incoming packets on multiple servers boosting the throughput tremendously. Our scheduling algorithm is based on Highest Random Weight (HRW), which maintains the connection locality for the incoming traffic, but only guarantees load balance at the connection level. We present an Adapted Highest Random Weight (AHRW) algorithm that enhances HRW by applying packet-level load balancing with an additional feedback vector corresponding to the queue length at each processor. We further introduce a Hierarchical AHRW (AHRW-tree) algorithm that considers characteristics of the multicore architecture such as cache and hardware topology by developing a hash tree architecture. The algorithm reduces the scheduling overhead to <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) instead of <i>O</i>( <i>N</i>) and produces a better balance between locality and load balancing. Results show that the AHRW-tree scheduler can improve the L7-filter throughput by about 50% on a Sun-Niagara-2-based server compared to a connection locality-based scheduler. Although extensively tested for L7-filter traces, our technique is applicable to many other packet processing applications, where connection locality and load balancing are important while executing on multiple processors. With these speedups and inherent software flexibility, our design and implementation provide a cost-effective alternative to the traffic monitoring and filtering ASICs.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2177858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6101571","Cache topology;L7-filter;connection locality;deep packet inspection (DPI);load balance;multicore processors;multithreading","Hardware;Load management;Multicore processing;Program processors;Protocols;Scheduling;Servers","Linux;application specific integrated circuits;inspection;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;network servers;packet switching;parallel architectures;processor scheduling;quality of service;resource allocation;software packages;telecommunication traffic;tree data structures","AHRW tree scheduler;AHRW-tree algorithm;L7-filter throughput;Linux;Netfilter;QoS;adapted highest random weight;connection locality;deep packet inspection;default OS scheduler;filtering ASIC;hash tree architecture;hierarchical AHRW algorithm;intensive payload classification;multicore architecture;multicore server;multithreaded L7-filter algorithm;network traffic classification;packet level load balancing;packet payload;packet processing application;parallelized L7-filter design;queue length;scheduler technique;software characteristics;software flexibility;traffic monitoring","","1","","40","","2011-12-12","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this issue, we propose Advance Oblivious comparison and VGuard, a framework that allows a Client and Server to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy. An efficient protocol, called Xhash, for Advance Oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of Guard is to first convert a firewall policy to non-overlapping numerical rules and then uses Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule.

Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to these particularities, classical routing protocols cannot be used and some specific ones have been proposed. Because routing process is fundamental in a MANET deployment, it constitutes a privileged target of attackers. In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2013.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258","Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security","Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols","","1","","9","","","2-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of multi-path routing under wormhole attack is studied in both cluster and uniform network topologies. Because multi-path routing is vulnerable to wormhole attacks, a scheme called statistical analysis of multi-path (SAM) is proposed to detect such attacks and to identify malicious nodes. As the name suggests, SAM detects wormhole attacks and identifies attackers by statistically analyzing the information collected by multi-path routing. Neither additional security services or systems nor security enhancement of routing protocols is needed in the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that SAM successfully detects wormhole attacks and locates the malicious nodes in networks with cluster and uniform topologies and with different node transmission range.","1525-3511","0-7803-8966-2","","10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424843","","Ad hoc networks;Delay;Electronic mail;Information analysis;Information security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;routing protocols;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","cluster network topology;multi-path routing;node transmission range;routing protocols;statistical analysis;uniform network topology;wireless ad hoc networks;wormhole attack detection;wormhole attack location","","17","","16","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reasons can be classified into two kinds. The first kind is known as normal reasons, that is, the processing of mass arriving packets of a large flow can not be limited to a determinable period of time and thus makes other flows starved. The second kind, in which the CPU is trapped in a dead-loop like state due to processing some packets with particular content of a flow, is considered as abnormal reasons. In fact, it is a kind of software crashes. In this paper, we discuss the innate defects of traditional packet-driven NIDS, and implement a flow-driven framework which can achieve fine-grained controllability. An Active Two-threshold scheme based on ideal Exit-Point (ATEP) is proposed in order to diminish data preserving overhead during flow switches and to detect crash in time. A quick crash recovery mechanism is also given which can recover the trapped thread from 90% crashes in 0.2 ms. The experimental results show that our flow-driven framework with ATEP scheme can achieve higher throughput and less packet loss ratio than the uncontrollable packet-driven systems with less than 1% of extra CPU overhead. What's more, in the case of crash occurrence, the ATEP scheme is still able to maintain rather steady throughput without sudden decrease.","","978-1-4244-7422-6","978-1-4244-7421-9","10.1109/SNPD.2010.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521501","ATEP;controllability;crash detection;flow-driven;quick crash recovery","Artificial intelligence;Computer crashes;Controllability;Intrusion detection;Software engineering;Software testing;System testing;Throughput;Vehicle crash testing;Yarn","security of data","active two-threshold scheme;data preserving overhead;flow-level controllability;ideal exit-point;network intrusion detection system;packet loss;packet-driven NIDS;packet-driven systems;quick crash recovery mechanism;software crashes","","1","","14","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several kinds of routing techniques are proposed in the literature and could be classified into topology-based or position-based strategies. Position-based is the most investigated strategy in vehicular networks due to the unique characteristics of such networks. For this reason, this work is based on the well-known intersection-based routing protocol GyTAR, which exploits the greedy forwarding technique to relay data. In fact, we benefit from GyTAR's characteristics and reshape it to introduce a new distributed trust management strategy to secure routing. We design a cluster-based mechanism to monitor nodes and a reputation-based schema to evaluate the vehicles and classify them. We evaluate our proposal using NS3 simulator.

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host. An admin version of Collabra exists on a privileged domain in the VM network to perform filtering of malicious add-ons to hyper-calls at the guest OS level itself before routing the call to the VMM.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945321","cloud computing;distributed intrusion detection system;hyper-call;intrusion detection architecture;virtual machine","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Driver circuits;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors","application program interfaces;cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtual private networks","Collabra;Xen hypervisor based collaborative intrusion detection system;abstraction layer;cloud security;distributed intrusion detection platform;filtering layer;guest operating system;hyper-call API;hyper-call interface;malicious add-ons filtering;virtual machine monitor;virtualized network","","10","","24","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, it is easy to deploy and terminate large number of malicious virtual machines (VMs) in a few seconds while the administrator is probably difficult to identify these malicious VMs immediately. These features open doors for attackers to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that target at degrading the quality of cloud service. This paper studies an attack scenario that malicious tenants use cloud resources to launch DoS attack targeting at data center subnets. Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors. We conduct our experiments in the campus-wide data center, and the results show our detection system can promptly and accurately response to DoS attacks.","","978-1-4799-8086-4","","10.1109/CBD.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176094","Attack Detection;Cloud Data Center;DoS Attack;Information Entropy","","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security;data flow analysis;entropy;system monitoring;virtual machines","CPU usage;DoS attack;attack behavior;attack identification;campus-wide data center;cloud data center;cloud resources;cloud service quality degradation;data center subnets;data flow based detection;data flow pattern;entropy-based denial of service attack detection;information entropy;malicious VM;malicious tenants;malicious virtual machines;network resource isolation;network usage;virtual machine status monitoring","","0","","21","","","20-22 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 24th","20051227","2005","2","","10 pp. Vol. 2","","Air Traffic Service Providers (ATSPs) are embarking on a transition of their information systems to a new paradigm of System Wide Information Management (SWIM). SWIM defines an enterprise-wide open, flexible, modular, manageable and secure architecture that is transparent to users. Information sharing, including real-time capability, enables operational improvements and facilitates a reduction in the overall cost of operation and maintenance. SWIM enables decision support systems that connect many stakeholders including the ATSPs and the Airline Operations Centers. For the National Airspace System (NAS), SWIM also facilitates information sharing between with other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Due to the increased interconnection of ATSP systems and connections to outside enterprises and agencies, security requirements have expanded. New SWIM applications will be written using new technologies. Adapters will be developed to connect legacy applications. The new technologies introduced by SWIM allow a more standardized approach to security, while supporting existing security mechanisms in legacy applications. This paper proposes a security architecture for SWIM, including Identity and Access Management, Registry-Directory-Naming services security, Messaging security, Digital Rights Management and Security Information Management. It also describes the security requirements for the Common Data Transport (CDT) that underlies SWIM, including link and network security, firewalls and intrusion detection systems.","","0-7803-9307-4","","10.1109/DASC.2005.1563474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563474","","Costs;Data security;Decision support systems;Identity management systems;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Management information systems;National security;Terrorism","aerospace computing;air traffic control;authorisation;decision support systems;safety-critical software","Department of Homeland Security;National Airspace System;air traffic service provider;airline operations center;common data transport;decision support systems;digital rights management;firewalls;identity and access management;information sharing;intrusion detection systems;messaging security;network security;registry-directory-naming services security;security architecture;security information management;system wide information management","","0","","","","","30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a civilian application, nodes are assumed to be selfish and rational, i.e., they pursue their own self-interest. Hence, the ability to accurately measure traffic forwarding is critical to ensure proper network operation. These measurements are often used to credit nodes based on their level of participation, or to detect loss. Past solutions employ neighbor monitoring and reporting on node forwarding traffic. These methods are not applicable in civilian networks where neighbor nodes lack the desire or ability to perform the monitoring function. Such environments occur frequently in which neighbor hosts are resource constrained, or in networks where directional antennas are used and reliable monitoring is difficult or impossible. In this paper, we propose a protocol that uses nodes on the data path to securely produce packet forwarding reports. Reporting nodes are chosen randomly and secretly so that malicious nodes cannot modify their behavior based upon the monitoring point. The integrity and authenticity of reports are preserved through the use of secure link layer acknowledgments and monitoring reports. The robustness of the reporting mechanism is strengthened by forwarding the report to multiple destinations (source and destination). We explore the security, cost, and accuracy of our protocol.","","0-7695-2375-7","","10.1109/MOBIQUITOUS.2005.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540983","","Costs;Directional antennas;Loss measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Protocols;Robustness;Security;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;data integrity;directive antennas;message authentication;mobile radio;monitoring;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","authenticity report;civilian application;data integrity;directional antenna;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring function;packet forwarding report;secure link layer acknowledgment;traffic forwarding activity;traffic measurement","","1","","20","","","17-21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The HAN controller, which acts as a gateway, should not cause any delay by decrypting and re-encrypting the packets, nor should it has any chance to modify them. Considering the required level of security and quality of service, we design our protocol with an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) approach. We improve and implement the Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol in two steps. First, we propose an auxiliary mechanism that is an ECC version of PAKE, and then extend it to a multilayer consensus model. We reduce the number of hash functions to one, and utilize a primitive password shared between an appliance and HAN controller to construct four valid individual consensus and authenticated symmetric keys between the appliance and upstream controllers by exchanging only 12 packets. Security analysis presents that our protocol is resilient to various attacks. Furthermore, performance analysis shows that the delay caused by the security process is reduced by more than one half.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2226252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471884","Access control;ECC;ECDH;PAKE;consensus;hierarchical control;multilayer;security;smart grid","","access control;control engineering computing;cryptographic protocols;domestic appliances;file organisation;home networks;internetworking;network servers;power system control;power system security;public key cryptography;quality of service;smart power grids","ECC approach;HAN);MCEPAK protocol;PAKE;access control;appliance-device;elliptic curve cryptography approach;gateway;hash function;home area network;multilayer consensus ECC-based password authenticated key-exchange protocol;packet decryption;packet reencryption;quality of service;security process;smart grid system","","2","","29","","","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a collaborative environment with many Wi-Fi sniffers, such attacks can be easily detected by sensing the anomaly RSS changes. However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method.

The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we propose a distributed intrusion detection approach based on finish state machine (FSM).A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then we construct the finite state machine (FSM) by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify every nodes behaviour by the FSM, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, our approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness.","","0-7695-2263-7","","10.1109/SAINTW.2005.1619986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1619986","","Authentication;Automata;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","","","","5","","8","","","31-04 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing.

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS).

But during the past year or so, we have observed an unprecedented growth in classic file-infecting viruses that have enjoyed a relatively high degree of success in the wild - causing widespread damage to computer systems. Many of the new viruses seen today aren't advancements in their own right; rather, they have just taken advantage of advancements in technology. And the sophistication of infection techniques and vectors used by viruses these days are on the rise. With a recent increase in network file-infecting viruses, it's high time we revisit the traditional techniques used to detect virus-like activity on the network and improve them.

MANET is an emerging research area with practical applications. However, wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics, such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability. Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. In general, routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is not trivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues of MANETs, and analyze in detail one type of attack-the ""black hole"" problem-that can easily be employed against the MANETs.

A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter. In this paper, a collaborative approach towards timely detection of such attacks through pattern reconstruction and verification is proposed. The scheme is capable of detecting anomalous readings within a consumer's household, with minimal communication and processing overhead imposed.","","978-1-4673-0894-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530492","","","Internet;power engineering computing;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Internet;anomalous readings;centralized servers;consumer devices;customer specific data;data aggregators;data concentrators;device implant attack detection;electricity grid;malicious attacks;pattern reconstruction;processing overhead;smart grid infrastructure;smart meters","","0","","15","","","3-5 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives. This paper analyses the various spoofing detection methods in WLANs bringing out their pros and cons including the different level of security provided ranging from low to high. The analysis in the paper also brings out as to which particular method could be more suitable in a particular scenario and how one can easily get the reduced false positives, which has been a bane of current detection methods. The paper also presents two case scenarios, particularly highlighting the victim Silent case scenario not discussed much thus far in the current literature on the topic, to validate the results. By way of retrospect, an outline of future work is also suggested in the concluding remarks.","","978-1-4799-1605-4","","10.1109/ICSPCom.2013.6719774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6719774","802.11 Wireless LAN;FRR;FRR-RA;MAC address;SNRA;Sequence Gap;Spoofing;false positives / negatives;transmission rate;victim Silent case in WLAN","Authentication;Computer crime;Monitoring;Probes;Protocols;Wireless LAN","access protocols;computer network security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN;MAC spoofing detection techniques;WLAN spoofing detection methods;cyber crimes;cyber criminal;denial of service;masquerading attacks;network identifiers;perpetrator-initiator;potent weapon;session hijacking;victim silent case","","0","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these attacks are very simple in implementation, their effect on WiFi networks can be devastating. To this end, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been employed to detect these attacks. In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network. Results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against the different versions of the attack compared to Snort-Wireless and can achieve a detection rate in average 100% and a false positive rate in average 0.1%","","1-4244-0700-1","","10.1109/CISDA.2007.368156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219103","","Computational intelligence;Data security;Detectors;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","digital signatures;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless LAN","GP-based IDS;WiFi networks;data link layer attacks;deauthentication attack;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;intrusion detector;snort-wireless","","0","","16","","","1-5 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, because the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of moving more processing power into storage, this paper presents a novel idea to design an IDS on object-based storage devices (OSD), and analyzes how the features of OSD can be used for intrusion detection (ID) and for violation responding. Moreover, the existing OSD standard is enhanced to own the new functions. Compared with the existing research on block-level storage devices, OSD-based ID is more straightforward for implementation.

In this paper, we identify that there are unique security challenges in a BV's different battery states. Accordingly, we propose a battery status-aware authentication scheme (BASA) to address the issue for V2G networks. In BASA, 1) an aggregated-identifier is proposed during the charging-to-FC state transition to ensure that BVs can be authenticated without disclosing their real identities; 2) selective disclosure based challenge-response authentication is presented during the FC-to-discharging phase to realize anonymous data transmission; 3) an aggregated-status is reported during the discharging-to-charging transition in order to hide a BV's power level from an aggregator. In addition, we perform comprehensive security analysis, which shows that BASA achieves both privacy preservation and security protection during battery state transitions. The analysis also indicates that battery status awareness is crucial for BVs' secure operations for V2G networks in smart grid.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2224387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461499","Authentication;battery status;privacy;security;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Authentication;Batteries;Privacy;Smart grids;Vehicles","automobiles;battery powered vehicles;power engineering computing;smart power grids","BASA;BV;FC-to-discharging phase;V2G networks;battery state transitions;battery status-aware authentication scheme;battery vehicles;challenge-response authentication;data transmission;discharging-to-charging transition;information services;power grid;power services;privacy preservation;security protection;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid","","4","","26","","2013-02-13","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We then propose regular expression rewrite techniques that can effectively reduce memory usage. Further, we develop a grouping scheme that can strategically compile a set of regular expressions into several engines, resulting in remarkable improvement of regular expression matching speed without much increase in memory usage. We implement a new DFA-based packet scanner using the above techniques. Our experimental results using real-world traffic and patterns show that our implementation achieves a factor of 12 to 42 performance improvement over a commonly used DFA- based scanner.

Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801","Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks","","6","","17","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
