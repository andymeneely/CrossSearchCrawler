IEEE International Symposium on","20091228","2009","","","1","10","An emerging class of applications for enterprise wireless LANs (WLAN) is voice over IP (VoIP) applications, which impose a stringent requirement on end-to-end delay. Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device. As a result, the proposed architecture can automatically provide seamless network-layer handoff to a wide variety of mobile devices (such as PDA, portable, cell phone) running on different operating systems, as long as they are equipped with 802.11 network interface.","1526-7539","978-1-4244-4927-9","978-1-4244-4928-6","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366648","","Cellular phones;Delay;Frequency;Hardware;Internet telephony;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Network interfaces;Operating systems;Roaming;Wireless LAN","IP networks;Internet telephony;cellular radio;mobile computing;wireless LAN","Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture;IEEE 802.11 WLAN;PDA;cell phone;cellular networks;device-transparent network-layer handoff;enterprise wireless LAN;micromobility;mobile IP;mobile devices;voice over IP;wireless overlay network","","0","1","18","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the SDN architecture empowers networks to actively monitor traffic and diagnose threats to facilitates network forensics, security policy alteration, and security service insertion. The separation of the control and data planes, however, opens security challenges, such as man-in-the middle attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and saturation attacks. In this paper, we analyze security threats to application, control, and data planes of SDN. The security platforms that secure each of the planes are described followed by various security approaches for network-wide security in SDN.

In DPI, packet payload is compared against a large number of rules written in regular expression. To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination. SRD-DFA can be easily used with advanced DFA compression algorithms to achieve much less memory consumption.","","978-0-7695-3929-4","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380614","DFA;Minimization;Regular Expression","Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Explosions;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Power engineering and energy;Throughput","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA compression algorithms;L7-filter rule set;Snort rule set;advanced DFA compression algorithms;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;extended DFA structure;memory consumption;packet payload;subrule distinguishable DFA","","2","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally intrusion detection has relied on two data sources: various log files which record user's activity, and network traffic which contains potential threats. This research presents a system which we call IDEA; the Intrusion DEtection Automata system. We utilize a third source of data for intrusion detection in the form of an instrumented process. Open source software is recompiled using a modified compiler we have created, and the resulting executable program generates the data as it runs. An external monitoring facility then checks the behavior of the program against known good execution paths. These paths are specified either using a domain specific language and hand-written rules, or by running the software in a learning mode and capturing the normal behavior for later comparison.","","978-0-7695-3126-7","","10.1109/ISA.2008.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511526","instrumentation;intrusion detection;open-source","Automata;Computerized monitoring;DSL;Domain specific languages;Information security;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Operating systems;Telecommunication traffic","security of data","computer systems;data source;intrusion detection automata system;network traffic","","1","","17","","","24-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, whether for selfish or malicious reasons, a node may fail to cooperate during the network operations or even attempt to disturb them, both of which have been recognized as misbehaviors. Various trust management schemes have been studied to assess the behaviors of nodes so as to detect and mitigate node misbehaviors inMANETs. Most of existing schemes model a node's trustworthiness along a single dimension, combining all of the available evidence to calculate a single, scalar trust metric. A single measure, however, may not be expressive enough to adequately describe a node's trustworthiness in many scenarios. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of MANET node from multiple perspectives. Our scheme evaluates trustworthiness from three perspectives: collaboration trust, behavioral trust, and reference trust. Different types of observations are used to independently derive values for these three trust dimensions. We present simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in several scenarios.","","978-1-4244-7075-4","","10.1109/MDM.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5489228","Misbehavior;Mobile Ad hoc Network;Multi-dimensional trust;Security","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Computer network management;Computer science;Conference management;Engineering management;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Radio spectrum management;Relays","","","","8","","26","","","23-26 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the GPU-to-GPU case, we consider several refinements to a base GPU implementation and measure the performance gain from each refinement. For the host-to-host case, we analyze two strategies to communicate between the host and the GPU and show that one is optimal with respect to runtime while the other requires less device memory. This analysis is done for GPUs with one I/O channel to the host as well as those with 2. Experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU that has 240 cores running off of a Xeon 2.8 GHz quad-core host CPU show that, for the GPU-to-GPU case, our Aho-Corasick GPU adaptation achieves a speedup between 8.5 and 9.5 relative to a single-thread CPU implementation and between 2.4 and 3.2 relative to the best multithreaded implementation. For the host-to-host case, the GPU AC code achieves a speedup of 3.1 relative to a single-threaded CPU implementation.

ISCC 2007. 12th IEEE Symposium on","20071112","2007","","","71","78","Distributed intrusion detection and prevention plays an increasingly important role in securing computer networks. In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a ""single point of failure "". We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge. The benefits of our approach are evaluated for a well-known probing attack.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-1520-5","978-1-4244-1521-2","10.1109/ISCC.2007.4381564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381564","","Aggregates;Centralized control;Computer networks;Computer science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Mobile communication;Scalability;Stability","computer networks;cryptography;table lookup","computer network security;distributed hash table;distributed intrusion detection system;intrusion alert correlation;meta-alerts","","5","","26","","","1-4 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, access control mechanisms deal with allow or deny a based rule (for access to a file) which even extends to role based access control in some cases. This directly implies that access protection mechanism is generally tightly coupled with almost all operating systems. Still, intrusion is a common phenomenon.

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Any attacker in the vicinity can easily get onto the internal network through a rogue AP, bypassing all perimeter security measures. Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.","","978-1-4244-1432-1","978-1-4244-1433-8","10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468","","Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN","","","","9","","16","","","10-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since many scientists compete for resources, most supercomputing centers practice strict scheduling policies and perform meticulous accounting on their usage. Thus computing resources and time assigned to a user is considered invaluable. However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.","","978-1-4244-9879-6","978-0-7695-4330-7","10.1109/POLICY.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791","","Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software","fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces","fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy","","1","","23","","","6-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

The main contribution of this work is in the introduction of a Node-based Trust Management (NTM) scheme in MANET based on the assumption that individual nodes are themselves responsible for their own trust level. We explore and develop the mathematical framework of trust in NTM. We have defined a proposed metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust.

Several of them are not sufficient and effective. Many intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or their efficiency, but they do not address the security problems. A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node. In this research we have simulated different types of attacks and also provided pseudo code for different attacks like route invasion, eavesdrop, sinkhole. Then the performance of these attacks against the proposed algorithm has been calculated and result is displayed.","","978-0-9893-1933-1","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918258","Adhoc networks;Denial of service;Intrusion;Multitier;Trust;commitment","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","DSR algorithm;application layer data;application tier;data transfer;intrusion detection systems;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;muiltier intrusion detection system;routing policy;routing tier;security attack;trust tier;trusted connection;trusted multitier method","","0","","15","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SECON '07. 4th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on","20070820","2007","","","678","684","While mechanisms exist to instantiate common security functionality such as confidentiality and integrity, little has been done to define a mechanism for identification and remediation of devices engaging in behavior deemed inappropriate. This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software- defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices. We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, (1) impacts system performance, (2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, (3) addresses ""bad mouthing"" and (4) resists collusion.","","1-4244-1268-4","1-4244-1268-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2007.4292881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4292881","","Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Resists;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML","XML;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","802.11 network;XML based policy engine;bad mouthing;centralized trust authority;misbehaving nodes;physical layer information;reputation vector;reputation-enabled intrusion detection system;software programmable devices;wireless networks","","3","","22","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In local monitoring, nodes overhear partial neighborhood communication to detect misbehavior such as packet drop or delay. However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to stealthy packet dropping through transmission power control. Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. We provide a protocol called MPC to remedy the attack. MPC expands the set of possible monitors of a node by redefining the monitor role and functionality. We show through analysis and simulation that the basic local monitoring (BLM) fails to efficiently mitigate stealthy power control attacks while MPC successfully mitigates them.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425559","","Communication system traffic control;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Power control;Protocols;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;power control;protocols;security of data;wireless channels","MPC;basic local monitoring;malicious behavior;mitigating security attacks;mitigating stealthy power control attacks;multihop ad-hoc networks;partial neighborhood communication;protocol;stealthy packet dropping;wireless ad hoc networks","","0","","18","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has been widely used as an important component in protecting online service towards Web attacks and evasions. Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called zero administrative server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a virtual machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion. In this paper, we demonstrate ZAS by exposing it to several attacking tools as well as to show the effects it takes on the network performance in terms of TCP throughput and application-to-application round trip time.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276470","Checksum;Intrusion Detection System;Virtual Machine;WWW Server","File servers;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection;Testing;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server;World Wide Web","Web services;security of data;virtual machines","VM based autonomous Web server;Web attacks;intrusion detection systems;malicious attacks;network performance testing;online services;virtual machine;zero administrative server","","0","","16","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, traffic patterns observed are used to model node behavior in wireless sensor networks. Firstly, selected traffic related features are used to translate observed packets into different events. Following this, unique patterns based on the arriving order of different packet events are extracted to form the normal profile for each sensor node during the profile learning stage.

ICNS '07","20070716","2007","","","1","12","Generalized multiple protocol label switching (GMPLS) extends multi protocol label switching (MPLS) to provide the control plane for use with high speed/bandwidth switching networks. The control plane protocols are vulnerable to attacks both from outside and within the network. SigSectrade, an intrusion detection system under development, is intended to help detect and protect against attacks and is based on the premise that the GMPLS management, signaling and routing protocols are similar to programming languages. A protocol can be compared to a language definition: it contains a vocabulary, syntax definition and semantics. Like any computer language the protocol language must be unambiguous. The protocol specifies the behavior of concurrently executing processes. This concurrency creates a new class of subtle issues. One technique to address these issues is the finite state machine (FSM). SigSec captures the signaling protocol messages and forwards them to the appropriate protocol analyzer in addition to saving them to a database. SigSec performs intrusion detection through multiple layers of checks and verifications. SigSec detects many known attacks that may pass through semantic and syntax analyzers. Results of the security attack profile analysis indicate that SigSec is capable of protecting the control plane against any number of attack profiles.","","1-4244-1216-1","1-4244-1216-1","10.1109/ICNSURV.2007.384158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272190","","Automata;Bandwidth;Computer languages;Concurrent computing;Intrusion detection;Multiprotocol label switching;Protection;Routing protocols;Signal analysis;Vocabulary","multiprotocol label switching;routing protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security","SigSec;computer language;control plane protocols;finite state machine;generalized multiple protocol label switching;intrusion detection;language definition;non-conformance;protocol analyzer;routing protocols;security attack profile analysis;semantic analyzers;semantics;signaling protocols;switching networks;syntax definition;trusted behaviors","","1","","11","","","April 30 2007-May 3 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper focuses on the special case where video is protected by Forward Error Correction mechanisms, which allow reordering of the original packet sequence after it may have been altered by network impairments.

In this work we conduct a complex experiment to expand our understanding of forensics analysis processes. During a period of four weeks we systematically investigated 200 detected security incidents about compromised hosts within a large operational network. We used data from four commonly-used security sources, namely Snort alerts, reconnaissance and vulnerability scanners, blacklists, and a search engine, to manually investigate these incidents. Based on our experiment, we first evaluate the (complementary) utility of the four security data sources and surprisingly find that the search engine provided useful evidence for diagnosing many more incidents than more traditional security sources, i.e., blacklists, reconnaissance and vulnerability reports. Based on our validation, we then identify and make available a list of 138 good Snort signatures, i.e., signatures that were effective in identifying validated malware without producing false positives. In addition, we compare the characteristics of good and regular signatures and highlight a number of differences. For example, we observe that good signatures check on average 2.14 times more bytes and 2.3 times more fields than regular signatures. Our analysis of Snort signatures is essential not only for configuring Snort, but also for establishing best practices and for teaching how to write new IDS signatures.","","978-1-4799-0458-7","","10.1109/SPW.2013.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565238","IDS;Infections;Malware;Network forensics","Correlators;Forensics;Malware;Manuals;Reconnaissance;Search engines","digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software;search engines","IDS signatures;Snort alerts;Snort signatures;blacklists;evidence collection;evidence correlation;malware;network forensics analysis;operational environment;reconnaissance;search engine;security data sources;security incident manual forensics investigation;vulnerability scanners","","3","","25","","","23-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20060123","2005","3","","6 pp.","","Fast virus scanning is becoming increasingly important in today's Internet. While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning ""booster"" technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of ""no-match"" cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of ""bad but cheap"" hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for ""on-access"" virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user. Through intercepting system calls and wrapping glibc libraries, we have implemented an ""on-access"" version for Hash-AV+Clam-AV. The on-access scanner can examine input data at a throughput of over 200 Mb/s, making it suitable for network-based virus scanning.","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577953","","Application software;Central Processing Unit;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Viruses (medical)","Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;filtering theory","CPU cycle speed;CPU second-level caches;Clam-AV;Hash-AV;Internet;bloom filter array;cache-resident filters;fast virus signature scanning;glibc libraries wrapping;hash functions;on-access scanner;open-source virus scanner;random memory accesses;system calls interception","","12","7","25","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching. Using our approach, we demonstrate significant increases in single-core performance over optimized baselines for two applications.","","978-1-4673-5524-7","","10.1109/CGO.2013.6494989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494989","Fine Grained Parallelism;Irregular Data Structure;SIMD","Compaction;Data structures;Decision trees;Indexes;Layout;Parallel processing;Vegetation","data structures;optimisation;parallel programming","SIMD parallelization;SIMD units;arithmetic operations;fine-grained data parallelism;intermediate language;irregular data structures;memory latency;optimizations;prefetching;run-time scheduler;run-time scheme;single-core performance;stream compaction method;tiling approach","","1","","37","","","23-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","2","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2","978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured.

Wireless communication offers the benefits of low cost, rapid deployment, shared communication medium, and mobility; at the same time, it causes many security and privacy challenges. In this paper, the concept of dynamic secret is applied to design an encryption scheme for smart grid wireless communication. Between two parties of communication, the previous packets are coded as retransmission sequence, where retransmitted packet is marked as “1” and the other is marked as “0.” During the communication, the retransmission sequence is generated at both sides to update the dynamic encryption key. Any missing or misjudging in retransmission sequence would prevent the adversary from achieving the keys. In our experiments, a smart grid platform is built, employing the ZigBee protocol for wireless communication. And a dynamic secret-based encryption demo system is designed based on this platform. The experiment results show that the retransmission and packet loss in ZigBee communication are inevitable and unpredictable, and it is impossible for the adversary to track the updating of the dynamic encryption key.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2264537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584806","Dynamic secret-based encryption;ZigBee;retransmission;security;smart grid;wireless communication","Encryption;Monitoring;Smart grids;Wireless communication;Zigbee","Zigbee;cryptography;power system security;smart power grids","ZigBee protocol;dynamic encryption key;dynamic secret;encryption scheme;power system;retransmission sequence;security problems;shared communication medium;smart grid wireless communication","","3","","29","","2013-08-22","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) that automatically generate and apply protection to client systems have been proposed as a solution. Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks. Our prototype also avoids a lot of practical problems faced by many other IPSs","","0-7695-2564-4","","10.1109/IWIA.2006.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609996","","Computer worms;Concrete;Contracts;Detectors;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Prototypes;Testing","security of data","LAIDS/LIDS framework;Lazy Shepherding IPS;client systems;intrusion prevention systems","","0","","17","","","13-14 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, we propose a novel multi-layer access control mechanism for mobile devices, which provides strong protection against the identified mobile threats as well as performance efficiency. Our Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) and secure domain have independent access control modules to effectively control mobile device's resources. Access control module at VMM controls access requests from a domain to physical/virtual resources in order to confine sharing resources among domains for confidentiality. It also protects a mobile device against DoS attacks draining limited system resources such as battery and memory to guarantee availability. In addition, access control at secure domain enforces fine-grained control of resources (e.g., file system access control) in upper layer without degrading performance of a mobile device due to additional hypercall invocations. Furthermore, there is no bypass of our access control since our ACM is placed inside VMM which is simple and small enough to verify its safety and we eliminated the chance of VMM corruption by checking integrity of VMM including ACM during bootstrap time.","","978-1-4244-1456-7","978-1-4244-1457-4","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446361","","Access control;Availability;Batteries;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;File systems;Protection;Safety;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;mobile computing;monitoring;virtual machines","DoS attacks;mobile devices;mobile threats;multilayer mandatory access control mechanism;system virtualization technology;virtual machine monitor","","8","","26","","","10-12 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However because of the nodes resource limitations, other schemes proposed for securing general ad hoc networks, are not appropriate for WSNs. Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game. As this game approaches to Nash equilibrium, it leads to a defense strategy for the network.","","978-0-7695-3501-2","","10.1109/CMC.2009.325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797305","Intrusion detection system;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Bayesian game approach;DoS attacks;Nash equilibrium;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;malicious nodes;network defense strategy;node interaction;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor networks","","2","","13","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given the speed with which new technologies are introduced in the Web environment, system deployment life cycles have shrunk significantly-but so have system life spans. After only a few years, an organization's Internet infrastructure is likely to need a major overhaul. In late 2001, the systems architecture team to which I belong took on these issues for an organization that wanted to rebuild its Web infrastructure. The existing infrastructure contained multiple single points of failure, could not scale to expected usage patterns, was built on proprietary systems, and had a high management overhead. The legacy infrastructure had grown organically over the previous five years as administrators added unplanned features and functionality, and usage had grown 100-fold since the specifications were initially developed. Because of the age and condition of the legacy systems, we decided to redesign the solution from scratch to overcome the inherent limitations. This case study describes the process our systems architecture team followed for designing and deploying the new architecture. I detail the component selection rationale, with implementation details where allowed.

ICMANET is a disconnected MANET and is also a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) that sustains for higher delays. The routing in a disseminated network is a difficult task. A new routing scheme called A-Routing (AR) is been proposed with a motto of achieving optimal result in delivering the data packet towards the destined node.

Unfortunately, increasing network speeds and number of signatures makes it harder for the existing signature-based intrusion detection systems to keep up. This makes those systems the weak link and the bottleneck which decreases the overall network performance. Researchers found that 30%-60% of the overall processing time of signature-based intrusion detection systems is spent on pattern matching operations [1]. In this paper, we present a novel and fast software-based pattern matching algorithm to reduce the number of times to perform pattern matching. This new algorithm introduces an exclusion-inclusion filter programmed only with signatures prefixes. It filters out the clean traffic without requiring pattern matching and weeds out suspicious packets to be searched using a specially modified Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. The exclusion-inclusion filter is a modified Bloom filter that produces a list of probable matching signatures for each suspect packet. The remaining few suspicious packets are searched only for the probable matches. Compared to the Wu-Manber algorithm used in intrusion detection systems, the experimental results indicate a speed up of 3.4 times on average, 5.5 times for regular traffic, and 1.6 times for worst case traffic. The memory overhead added by the algorithm was limited to 0.11%.","","978-1-4577-1125-1","","10.1109/NWeSP.2011.6088148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088148","Bloom filters;Snort;intrusion detection;network security;pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Pulse width modulation;Vectors","pattern matching;security of data","Exscind algorithm;Wu-Manber pattern matching;exclusion filter;inclusion filter;signature-based intrusion detection systems;software-based pattern matching","","1","","28","","","19-21 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE GLOBECOM 2008. IEEE","20081208","2008","","","1","5","Pattern Matching (PM) over network packet flows for Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System is becoming more and more performance sensitive due to the rapid progress of Internet applications in terms of data volumes. Meanwhile, modern multicore platforms are becoming performance competitive with traditional hardware solutions for PM. But due to the unbalance of network flow sizes, traditional flow- based data parallel processing/programming model can not fully exert multicore platforms' computing power and results in poor performance scalability. In this paper, a novel parallel inspection model, Dynamic Differentiated Distributed Detection (D<sup>4</sup>) is proposed. D<sup>4</sup> deploys distributed parallel operations by adding one more dimension on workload partition/allocation. It proposes an effective and efficient scheme to pre-partition the pattern set in several candidate ways, called ""Detection Modes"", and let multiple candidate PM methods to handle the subsets, respectively; the most suitable Detection Mode would be selected specifically for each incoming flows at the run-time, and the workload would be dynamically allocated among multiple CPU cores. Experimental results on real-world pattern set and traffic traces show that D<sup>4</sup> scales much better than traditional schemes by better balancing the load among the processors while avoiding unnecessary overheads.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698165","","Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Data flow computing;Hardware;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Pattern matching","parallel algorithms;pattern matching;resource allocation;security of data","Internet;dynamic differentiated distributed detection;multicore platform;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;network packet flow;parallel inspection model;pattern matching","","1","","14","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective, a NIDS must be able to counter evasion attempts and operate at or near wire-speed. Failure to do so allows malicious packets to slip through a NIDS undetected. In this paper, we explore NIDS evasion through algorithmic complexity attacks. We present a highly effective attack against the Snort NIDS, and we provide a practical algorithmic solution that successfully thwarts the attack. This attack exploits the behavior of rule matching, yielding inspection times that are up to 1.5 million times slower than that of benign packets. Our analysis shows that this attack is applicable to many rules in SnortÂ¿s ruleset, rendering vulnerable the thousands of networks protected by it. Our countermeasure confines the inspection time to within one order of magnitude of benign packets. Experimental results using a live system show that an attacker needs only 4.0 kbps of bandwidth to perpetually disable an unmodified NIDS, whereas all intrusions are detected when our countermeasure is used.","1063-9527","0-7695-2716-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041157","","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Counting circuits;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protection;Protocols;TCPIP;Wire","","","","13","1","26","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such networks may be self operating or linked to a larger internet and may have one or multiple different transceivers between nodes resulting in a highly dynamic and autonomous topology. The first focus is on MANET attacks followed by detection of the malicious node from MANET via Polynomial-Reduction Algorithm. Although scientists have assessed many algorithms for the detection and rectification of the malicious nodes in the MANETs, the problem still persists. Due to the unprecedented growth in technology, the unidentified vulnerabilities are also intensifying. Therefore, it is very crucial to come up with some ground-breaking ideas to prevent the MANET.

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7754-8","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496","","Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols","","","","1","","24","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By deriving tolerance limits from the lognormal distribution of path lengths under normal conditions, we develop an anomaly detection scheme that detects sinkhole attacks in a computationally efficient manner.
