Proceedings. 2002 IEEE Symposium on","20040830","2002","","","285","293","As networks become faster there is an emerging need for security, analysis techniques that can keep up with the increased network throughput. Existing network-based intrusion detection sensors can barely, keep up with bandwidths of a few hundred Mbps. Analysis tools that can deal with higher throughput are unable to maintain state between different steps of an attack or they are limited to the analysis of packet headers. We propose a partitioning approach to network security, analysis that supports in-depth, stateful intrusion detection on high-speed links. The approach is centered around a slicing mechanism that divides the overall network traffic into subsets of manageable size. The traffic partitioning is done so that a single slice contains all the evidence necessary to detect a specific attack, making sensor-to-sensor interactions unnecessary. This paper describes the approach and presents a first experimental evaluation of its effectiveness.","1081-6011","0-7695-1543-6","","10.1109/SECPRI.2002.1004378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1004378","","Bandwidth;Computer network management;Ethernet networks;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Presses;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","local area networks;security of data","high-speed links;increased network throughput;network-based intrusion detection sensors;packet headers;partitioning approach;security analysis techniques;slicing mechanism;stateful intrusion detection","","42","4","12","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the on-going discovery of runtime software vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, it is critical to be able to gauge the integrity of a Cloud server as it operates. In this paper, we propose scoped invariants as a primitive for analyzing the software system for its integrity properties. We report our experience with the modeling and detection of scoped invariants. The Xen Virtual Machine Manager is used for a case study. Our research detects a set of essential scoped invariants that are critical to the runtime integrity of Xen. One such property, that the addressable memory limit of a guest OS must not include Xen's code and data, is indispensable for Xen's guest isolation mechanism. The violation of this property demonstrates that the attacker only needs to modify a single byte in the Global Descriptor Table to achieve his goal.","","978-1-4244-9405-7","978-0-7695-4302-4","10.1109/CloudCom.2010.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708514","Xen;integrity modeling;invariants detection;tools","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Runtime;Security;Servers;Software;Software measurement","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;virtual machines","Xen virtual machine manager;cloud computing security;cloud server;global descriptor table;runtime integrity;scoped invariant perspective;software vulnerabilities","","2","","28","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years, many attempts have been made to study the intrinsic attributes of these insider attacks but the focus has generally been on the analysis of one or very few particular attacks, or only the survey of various attacks without any performance analysis. Therefore, a major feature that research has lately lacked is a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of various insider attacks on the overall performance of MANETs. In this paper we investigate, in detail, some of the most severe attacks against MANETs namely the blackhole attack, sinkhole attack, selfish node behavior, RREQ flood, hello flood, and selective forwarding attack. A detailed NS-2 implementation of launching these attacks successfully using Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been presented and a comprehensive and comparative analysis of these attacks is performed. We use packet efficiency, routing overhead, and throughput as our performance metrics. Our simulation-based study shows that flooding attacks like RREQ flood and hello flood drastically increase the routing overhead of the protocol. Route modification attacks such as sinkhole and blackhole are deadly and severely affect the packet efficiency and bring down the throughput to unacceptable ranges.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296111","Blackhole;Hello flood;MANETs;Network layer attacks;RREQ flood;Selective forwarding;Selfish Node;Sinkhole","Ad hoc networks;Data models;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;RREQ flood;ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol;blackhole;blackhole attack;hello flood;malicious AODV;mobile ad hoc networks security;performance metrics;route modification attacks;routing attacks;selective forwarding attack;selfish node behavior;sinkhole;sinkhole attack","","4","","17","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DNA computation, evolutionary computation, artificial neural networks, and artificial immune systems are some of the research interest which can be pointed out. By means of diverse kinds of cells, molecules, and mechanisms, the immune system efficiently protects the human body against different kinds of attacks. Many immune-inspired techniques have been developed with the aim to tackle different computing problems. Network security represents one of the most significant fields that the immune-inspired techniques have been applied to. Given that mobile ad hoc networks have a decentralized nature similar to the human immune system (HIS), immune-inspired security architecture is highly expected to come across different ad hoc security problems, one of which is the malicious node that can disrupt the routing process, masquerade as the legitimate nodes, and impersonate the trusted nodes. In this paper, immune-inspired security architecture for simulating a number of HIS processes for securing mobile ad hoc networks is presented. Both the negative selection and danger theory techniques have been combined along with many other inspired processes to come up with a scalable and robust system. Distributability, second response and self recovery of nodes, are the hallmarks of the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4244-4706-0","978-1-4244-4707-7","10.1109/ICCA.2009.5410147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5410147","","Ad hoc networks;Artificial immune systems;Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;DNA computing;Evolutionary computation;Humans;Immune system;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection","ad hoc networks;computer network security;mobile computing;telecommunication network routing","distributability;human immune system;immune inspired framework;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network security;routing;second response;self recovery","","0","","20","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With Internet connectivity to such devices, the smart grid Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is exposed to attacks by the adversary class. Any compromise of a smart meter may jeopardize the security of not just the household in question, but also the entire neighborhood network and possibly the utility provider's core network. One attack category that may pose a serious threat to the AMI is a meter compromise attack, wherein a smart meter is controlled by the adversary, with the intent of committing energy fraud. In this paper, we present a detection model based on a cumulative analysis of smart meter readings of clustered smart meters. The clustering of smart meters is done based on the physical deployment points of individual smart meters within a neighbourhood area network.

The results of these studies provide answers to several questions concerning which properties are critical to intrusion detection. First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

Second International Workshop on","20051024","2005","","","52","61","Since the widespread adoption of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking during the late '90s, P2P applications have multiplied. Their diffusion and adoption are witnessed by the fact that P2P traffic accounts for a significant fraction of Internet traffic. Further, there are concerns regarding the use of these applications, for instance when they are employed to share copyright protected material. Hence, in many situations there would be many reasons to detect P2P traffic. In the late '90s, P2P traffic was easily recognizable since P2P protocols used application-specific TCP or UDP port numbers. However, P2P applications were quickly empowered with the ability to use arbitrary ports in an attempt to go undetected. Nowadays, P2P applications explicitly try to camouflage the originated traffic in an attempt to go undetected. Despite the presence of rules to detect P2P traffic, no methodology exists to extract them from applications without the use of reverse engineering. In this paper we develop a methodology to detect P2P traffic. It is based on the analysis of the protocol used by a P2P application, extraction of specific patterns unique to the protocol, coding of such a pattern in rules to be fed to an intrusion detection system (IDS), and validation of the pattern via network traffic monitoring with SNORT (an open source IDS) fed with the devised rules. In particular, we present a characterization of P2P traffic originated by the OpenNap and WPN protocols (implemented in the WinMx application) and FastTrack protocol (used by KaZaA) obtained using our methodology, that shows the viability of our proposal. Finally, we conclude the paper exposing our undergoing efforts in the extension of the methodology to exploit differences between centralized and decentralized P2P protocols, as well as the characterization of encrypted traffic, and highlight a new research direction in the identification of P2P traffic.","","0-7695-2417-6","","10.1109/HOT-P2P.2005.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517791","","Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Protection;Protocols;Reverse engineering;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;copyright;pattern recognition;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","FastTrack protocol;Internet traffic;KaZaA;OpenNap protocol;P2P application;P2P file-sharing traffic detection;P2P protocols;P2P traffic;SNORT;TCP;UDP;WPN protocol;copyright protected material;encrypted traffic characterization;intrusion detection system;network traffic monitoring;pattern extraction;peer-to-peer networking;reverse engineering","","12","1","23","","","21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additional hardware required for implementation of our framework has very low power and area overheads which makes it possible to practically implement execution monitoring even on embedded processors.

We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T<sub>c</sub> is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T<sub>l</sub> is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming. We show how to make fast and correct classification decisions under these constraints and apply them to real benchmark data. Comparison with state-of-the-art stream classification techniques prove the superiority of our approach.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453372","Data streams;K-means clustering;concept-drift;ensemble classification;k-nearest neighbor classification;novel class;silhouette coefficient.","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Delay effects;Fault detection;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Testing;Text categorization;Time factors;USA Councils","pattern classification","class detection mechanism;concept-drifting data streams;data stream classification technique;maximum allowable wait time;time constraints","","33","1","31","","2010-04-22","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among many other challenges, contemporary IDS have to cope with increasingly higher bandwidths, which sometimes force them to let some data go by without being checked for possible malicious activity. This paper presents a novel method to improve the performance of IDS based on multimedia traffic classification. In the proposed method, the IDS has additional knowledge about common multimedia file formats and uses this knowledge to perform a more detailed analysis of packets carrying that type of data. If the structure and selected contents of the data are compliant, the corresponding stream is tagged accordingly, and the IDS is spared from further work on that stream. Otherwise, an anomaly is detected and reported. Our experiments using Snort confirm that this additional specialized knowledge results in substantial computational savings, without significant overhead for processing non-multimedia data","","0-7695-2316-1","","10.1109/ICITA.2005.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1489011","","Computational efficiency;Computer security;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Multimedia systems;Open source software;Performance analysis;Streaming media;Telecommunication traffic","frame relay;multimedia communication;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","IDS;anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;multimedia file format;multimedia traffic classification scheme;network security","","0","","10","","","4-7 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Storage-based intrusion detection system (SIDS) has become a valuable tool in monitoring for the intrusion. However, the traditional storage device works on the block-level while intrusion always happens on the file-level, this gap has to be erased by detection software, which is a hard and time-consuming task. To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of storage technology, this paper presents a novel idea to design object-based intrusion detection architecture. In this paper, we study how intrusion can be detected at object level in the OBSS (object-based storage system) environment, and discuss how features of the OBSS can be used in intrusion detection. Through analysis, we find that the impact of intrusion detection on the OBSS is negligible. The advantage of this approach is simple.

Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and ""dysfunctional"" network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.","1095-2055","1-4244-0572-6","","10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617","","Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing","attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures","","0","","12","","","9-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces. The simulation results show that the StriFA acceleration scheme offers an increased speed over traditional nondeterministic finite automaton/deterministic finite automaton, while at the same time reducing the memory requirement.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2244791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475958","Deep packet inspection (DPI);deterministic finite automaton (DFA);network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes);nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)","Acceleration;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Educational institutions;Engines;Memory management;Pattern matching","finite automata;security of data;string matching","NIDS;StriFA acceleration scheme;attack database;attack identification;data stream;high-speed regular expression matching;line-rate packet processing;malicious information;network intrusion detection systems;stride finite automata;string matching;traffic stream","","2","","31","","2013-03-07","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The routing protocol is vulnerable to two kinds of attack: external and internal attack. We have discussed some existing external attacks and possible malicious behavior from compromised nodes. To mitigate the attacks, we propose a dual level security model. On the first level, we have the external attack detection model (EADM), that secures the network with authentication and confidentiality that rely on mutual trust between nodes.

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6231-5","","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Asymmetric Concurrency;Computational Model;Intrusion Detection;Memory Observation","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data structures;Information security;Interference;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","computational model;concealment mechanism;concurrent observations;concurrent processing units;cost model;data structures;forced synchronization;interleaved linearization;malicious code;observation mechanism;privilege escalation;resource contention;second-order operation;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency","","2","","19","","","11-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distance-based Outlier Detection (DBOD) is one of the most widely-used techniques for detecting outliers due to its simplicity and efficiency. Additionally, DBOD is an unsupervised approach which overcomes the problem of the lack of training datasets with known intrusions. However, since IDSs usually have high-dimensional datasets, using DBOD becomes subject to the curse of the dimensionality problem. Furthermore, intrusion datasets should be normalized before calculating pair-wise distance between observations. The purpose of this research is conduct a comparative study among different normalization methods in conjunction with a well-known feature extraction technique; Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, the efficiency of these methods as data preprocessing techniques can be investigated when applying DBOD to detect intrusions. Experiments were performed using two kinds of distance metrics; Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance. We further examined the PCA using 7 threshold values to indicate the number of Principle components to consider according to their total contribution in the variability of features. These approaches have been evaluated using the KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection (KDD-Cup) dataset. The main purpose of this study is to find the best attribute normalization method along with the correct threshold value for PCA so that a fast unsupervised IDS can discover intrusions effectively. The results recommended using the Log normalization method combined the Euclidean distance while performing PCA.","","978-1-4577-0582-3","","10.1109/PST.2011.5971981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971981","","Equations;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Training","principal component analysis;security of data;unsupervised learning","DBOD;Euclidean distance;IDS;Mahalanobis distance;PCA;data preprocessing;dimensionality problem;distance based outlier detection;distance based unsupervised intrusion detection;feature extraction technique;principle component analysis","","1","","29","","","19-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security mechanism for WSNs has to be considered differently from traditional network. Firstly, there are severe constraints on WSNs devices such as minimal energy, computational and communicational capabilities. Secondly, there is an additional risk of physical attacks such as node capture and tampering. Moreover, cryptography based techniques alone are insufficient to secure WSNs. Hence, intrusion detection techniques must be designed and developed to detect the any kind of undesirable attacks. Further, these techniques should be lightweight because of resource-constrained nature of WSNs. Therefore, we present a new approach of robust and lightweight solution for detecting the sinkhole attack based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) readings of messages. The proposed solution needs collaboration of some extra monitor (EM) nodes apart from the ordinary nodes. We use values of RSSI from four EM nodes to determine the position of all sensor nodes where the base station (BS) is located at origin position (0,0). We use this information as weight from the BS in order to detect sinkhole attack. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is lightweight due to the monitor nodes were not loaded with any ordinary nodes or BS. Moreover, the proposed mechanism does not cause the communication overhead.","","978-4-907764-34-0","978-4-907764-33-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334764","detecting sinkhole attacks;intruder detection;security in wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor networks","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power system security;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","RSSI;base station;communication system;extra monitor node;intrusion detection;node capture;physical attack;received signal strength indicator;security system;sinkhole attack detection;tampering;wireless sensor network","","0","","19","","","18-21 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At runtime once any system inconsistency has been detected, predefined recovery actions will be invoked. The consistency detection regulations and corresponding recovery actions can also be flexibly customized by system developers. The infrastructure requires few modifications to kernel source code, thus it is easy to integrate into existing embedded systems. The evaluation experiment results indicate our prototype system can correctly detect the inconsistent kernel data structures caused by security attacks and also prevent kernel from exploits due to vulnerable system calls with acceptable penalty to system performance. Moreover, it is fully software-based without introducing any specific hardware and requires no modifications to system call APIs, therefore legacy commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) applications can be also easily reused.","","978-0-7695-3492-3","","10.1109/EUC.2008.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756331","Detection;Recovery;Reliability;Security","Data security;Data structures;Embedded system;Kernel;Object detection;Protection;Prototypes;Runtime;Software prototyping;System performance","application program interfaces;data structures;embedded systems;operating system kernels;security of data;system monitoring;system recovery","commercial-off-the-shelf application;embedded system;kernel data structure;kernel object;kernel source code;lightweight system-level detection;recovery infrastructure;runtime protection;security attack;system call API;system call function;vulnerable system call","","0","","22","","","17-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the resistance against the attacks, the monitors are protected from identity exposure to prevent them becoming the explicit targets of adversaries. A collective monitoring triggering scheme is also proposed to further improve the capability and reliability of monitoring.

In cognitive radio networks, effect of these malicious users on network performance becomes more threatening, where they impersonate primary users by emitting similar signals, causing secondary users to vacate the occupied channel needlessly. As a result, network resources are unfairly monopolized by malicious users denying other secondary users their fair share. In this paper, we introduce a cross-layered approach to provide secondary users the ability to differentiate between a primary user and a malicious user, using Hidden Markov Model at MAC layer. Hence, our proposed framework allows the transport layer protocol to respond appropriately in a way that the effect of the presence of malicious user on the network is mitigated. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is shown by calculating the throughput of the network and number of channel switches with respect to varying number of secondary and malicious nodes and by comparing it to an earlier proposed TCP protocol.","","978-1-4799-2293-2","","10.1109/FIT.2013.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6717217","cognitive radio networks;cross layer design;security;transport layer protocol","Adaptation models;Cognitive radio;Hidden Markov models;Protocols;Throughput;Training;Wireless networks","access protocols;cognitive radio;computer network security;hidden Markov models;transport protocols;wireless channels","MAC layer;TCP protocol;channel switches;cognitive radio network;cross-layered approach;hidden Markov model;malicious node;open medium access;security threat;transport layer protocol;wireless channel;wireless network","","0","","23","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm allows skipping characters not in a match in the text, and in turn simultaneously inspect multiple characters in effect. The techniques to reduce the impact of certain bad situations on performance are also proposed: the <i>bad-block</i> heuristic, a linear worst-case time method and a non-blocking interface to hand over the verification job to a verification module. This architecture is simulated with both behavior simulation in C and timing simulation in HDL for antivirus applications.

In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical key management scheme in which nodes can get their keys updated either from their parent nodes or a threshold of sibling nodes.

However, most websites are not developed with sufficient security consideration. Hackers have taken the advantage of web application vulnerabilities to inject malicious codes into web pages. A victim who visits such a malicious web page will be compromised. Therefore, an efficient malicious web detection method is needed to prevent users from being compromised. Based on our observation, malicious web pages have uncommon behavior in order to evade from detection of Antivirus software. The anomaly behavior such as code encoding makes malicious web pages different from normal benign web pages. Current researches have noticed pattern-matching approach is not suitable to detect malicious web pages anymore, and then proposes a new detection method. The proposed method, a client-side malicious web page detection method, is based on anomaly behavior analysis. It focuses on distinguishing the behavior difference between malicious and benign web pages. The experimental results show that the proposed method can identify malicious web pages and alarm the website visitors efficiently.","","978-1-4244-5364-1","978-0-7695-3924-9","10.1109/NetCoM.2009.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383961","Anomaly behavior;Drive-by download;Malicious webpage","Application software;Banking;Computer hacking;Data security;Inspection;Java;Monitoring;Web and internet services;Web pages;Web services","Internet;security of data","Internet;Web browser;Web page inspection;Web service;anomaly behavior analysis;antivirus software;client side malicious Web page detection method;code encoding;malicious Web detection method;pattern matching approach","","2","","10","","","27-29 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring-based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that, even for a simple three-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by Markov and probabilistic models. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators, such as ns-2, OPNET or Glomosim. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is implemented in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50-node) ad hoc networks indicate that monitoring-based intrusion detection has very high false positives. These false positives can reduce the network performance or increase the overhead. In a simple monitoring-based system where no secondary and more accurate methods are used, the false positives impact the network performance in two ways: reduced throughput in normal networks without attackers and inability to mitigate the effect of attacks in networks with attackers.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620919","Mobile ad hoc networks;analytical models;false positives;intrusion detection;noise modeling;passive monitoring;performance analysis.","Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Noise;Noise measurement","Markov processes;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","Glomosim simulator;Markov models;data forwarding;false positive behavior;mobile ad hoc networks;monitoring-based intrusion detection;probabilistic noise generator model;revised noise model;three-node configuration","","3","","32","","2010-11-09","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces.

In particular, two main challenges in current collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) research are highlighted and reviewed: CIDS architectures and alert correlation algorithms. The focus will be on correlation of CIIDS alerts.

Virtualization plays a crucial role to support the IaaS. However, it is not safety because of exposing the hosted virtual machines (VMs) to uncontrollable environment. In addition, traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operation system kernel trustworthiness, are no longer effective to virtual infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce HVSM (Hybrid Virtualization Security Monitor) to deal with above security problems, which is a new In-OutVM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture depending on lightweight, comprehensive and dynamic security monitoring. First, as to Hybrid, HVSM utilizes virtual machine introspection technique to inspect kernel running state of the guest VM (GVM) from outside. Inside the GVM, measure agent (MA) tests and delivers processes' integrity information to security VM (SVM). In succession, MA is in the guard of measure agent keeper (MAK) running in the SVM. Second, dynamically, HVSM combines kernel state information with processes' integrity so as to provide a security report on GVM. Third, a proof-of-concept prototype is implemented using libvmi based on Xen hypervisor. Finally, we evaluate efficiency and the performance overhead of HVSM, which is acceptably low to support real-time monitoring.","","978-1-84919-909-4","","10.1049/cp.2014.1285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133816","Hybrid Security Monitor;IaaS Security;Integrity Measurement;Virtual Machine Introspection;Xen","","cloud computing;cost reduction;multi-agent systems;operating system kernels;resource allocation;security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","GVM;HVSM;IAAS cloud;MA test;MAK;PaaS;SVM;SaaS;Xen hypervisor;cost reduction;dynamic security monitoring;guest VM;hosted virtual machines;hybrid virtualization security monitor;in-guest security solutions;in-out-VM hybrid virtualization-aware architecture;in-out-VM security monitoring architecture;infrastructure-as-a service;kernel running state;kernel state information;libvmi;measure agent keeper;measure agent test;operation system kernel trustworthiness;process integrity;resource efficiency;security VM;virtual machine introspection technique","","0","","","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

The multimedia content in such networks has the potential of enhancing the level of information collected, enlarging the range of coverage, and enabling multi-view support. For WMSN applications, the multi-tier network architecture has proven to be more beneficial than a single-tier in terms of energy-efficiency, scalability, functionality and reliability. In this context, a multimedia intrusion detection application appears as a promising application of multi-tier WMSNs, where the lower tier can detect the intruder using scalar sensors, and the higher tier camera nodes will be woken up to send real time video sequences from the detected area. The transmission of multimedia content requires a certain quality level from the user perspective, while energy consumption and network overhead should be minimized. Among the existing mechanisms for improving video transmissions, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be regarded as a suitable solution to improve video quality level from the user point-of-view. In this work, we propose a Quality of Experience (QoE)-aware FEC mechanism for WMSNs, which creates redundant packets based on impact of the frame on the user experience. According to the simulation results, our proposed mechanism achieved similar video quality level compared with standard FEC, while reducing the transmission of redundant packets, which will bring many benefits in a resource-constrained system.","2160-4886","978-1-4673-1429-9","","10.1109/WiMOB.2012.6379150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379150","Forward error correction;Intrusion detection;Multi-tier architecture;QoE;Wireless multimedia sensor networks","Cameras;Forward error correction;Multimedia communication;Quality assessment;Redundancy;Streaming media;Video recording","forward error correction;image sequences;multimedia communication;quality of experience;security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;video coding;wireless sensor networks","QoE-aware FEC mechanism;camera nodes;forward error correction;multimedia content transmission;multimedia intrusion detection;multitier WMSN;multitier network architecture;multitier wireless multimedia sensor networks;quality of experience-aware FEC mechanism;real-time video sequences;redundant packets;reliability;resource-constrained system;scalar sensors;ubiquitous systems;video quality level","","3","","25","","","8-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the problems have been studied for many years and various solutions have been proposed, many security issues remain. To enhance the security and credibility of layer-2 network, we propose a trust-based spanning tree protocol aiming at achieving a higher credibility of LAN switch with a simple and lightweight authentication mechanism. If correctly implemented in each trusted switch, the authentication of trust-based STP can guarantee the credibility of topology information that is announced to other switch in the LAN. To verify the enforcement of the trusted protocol, we present a new credible evaluation method of the STP using a specification-based state model. We implement a prototype of trust-based STP to investigate its practicality. Experiment shows that the trusted protocol can achieve security goals and effectively avoid STP attacks with a lower computation overhead and good convergence performance.","","978-1-4799-4117-9","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2014.150","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6969534","STP;credible evaluation;network security;trusted network","Authentication;Bridges;Network topology;Protocols;Switches;Topology","computer network security;formal specification;local area networks;message authentication;routing protocols;trees (mathematics)","LAN switch;authentication mechanism;link layer protocol;spanning tree protocol;specification-based state model;topology information;trust-based STP;trust-based security","","0","","14","","","19-23 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DFA representations are popular, but suffer from the state-explosion problem. We introduce a new matching structure: a tree of DFAs where the DFA associated with a node over-approximates those at its children, and the DFAs at the leaves represent the signature set. Matching works top-down, starting at the root of the tree and stopping at the first node whose DFA does not match. In the common case (benign traffic) matching does not reach the leaves. DFA-trees are built using Compact Overapproximate DFAs (CODFAs). A CODFA D' for D over-approximates the language accepted by D, has a smaller number of states than D, and has a low false-match rate. Although built from approximate DFAs, DFA-trees perform exact matching faster than a commonly used method, have a low memory overhead and a guaranteed good worst case performance.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6847977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847977","","Approximation error;Automata;Computers;Conferences;DH-HEMTs;Payloads;Training","computational complexity;deterministic automata;digital signatures;finite automata;formal languages;pattern matching;tree data structures","CODFAs;DFA-trees;IPSs;NP-hard problem;benign traffic matching;compact overapproximate DFAs;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;intrusion prevention system;low false-match rate;low memory overhead;matching structure;parametrized language overapproximation;regular expressions;state-explosion problem;vulnerability signatures","","1","","30","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of the inspections one may make look for consistency with respect to data available only at the application layer, requiring one to position the analysis high in the protocol stack. Towards this end we propose a policy engine that examines both ingress and egress traffic to the AMI application layer. Policy engine rules may refer to the structure and behavior of the AMI protocol, and may also perform multi-stage analysis of data payloads looking for evidence that executable code is carried, rather than data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the policy engine is able to accurately distinguish between legitimate traffic and malware bearing traffic.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688003","","Encryption;Engines;Entropy;Malware;Payloads;Protocols","metering;power meters;power system security;protocols","AMI application layer;AMI control traffic;AMI protocol;advanced metering infrastructure;data payloads;deep packet inspection;malware propagation;multistage analysis;policy engine","","1","","25","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are networks that do not have an underlying infrastructure; the network topology is constantly changing. The inherently vulnerable characteristics of wireless ad hoc networks make them susceptible to attacks, and it may be too late before any counter action can take effect. Second, with so much advancement in hacking, if attackers try hard enough they will eventually succeed in infiltrating the system. This makes it important to constantly (or at least periodically) monitor what is taking place on a system and look for suspicious behavior. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do just that: monitor audit data, look for intrusions to the system, and initiate a proper response (e.g., email the systems administrator, start an automatic retaliation). As such, there is a need to complement traditional security mechanisms with efficient intrusion detection and response.

Mobile ad hoc networks are gaining popularity because of the availability of low cost mobile devices and its ability to provide instant wireless networking capabilities. MANET is an infrastructure less network and there is no central administration. The open medium, wide distribution of nodes, changing topology and no centralized monitoring makes MANETs vulnerable to malicious attackers. For these types of networks, security is the most essential service to provide protection and prevent malicious attacks occurring in the mobile nodes. Attackers can easily compromise MANETs by inserting malicious or non cooperative nodes into the network. To compensate MANET from these malicious activities in this paper, it is proposed a new intrusion detection & prevention algorithm named as Packet Dropping detection Algorithm (PDA). MANETs depends on the cooperation of nodes in the network for the forwarding of packets to the destination. The Cooperation requires detecting routes on the neighbor nodes. The cooperative node having malicious activity by the attacker may not forward or drops the packets, partially or fully. By PDA algorithm the neighbor nodes inform about the attacker by raising a global alarm and prevent an intruder from the malicious attacks in the network.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950037","PDA;detection;misbehaving node;packet dropping;prevention","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nominations and elections;Protocols","mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDA algorithm;PDA-misbehaving node detection;PDA-misbehaving node prevention;changing topology;cooperative node;intruder prevention;intrusion detection-prevention algorithm;low-cost mobile devices;malicious activity;malicious attack detection;malicious attack prevention;malicious attackers;malicious node;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;neighbor nodes;node cooperation;node distribution;noncooperative nodes;packet dropping detection algorithm;packet forwarding;route detection;wireless networking capabilities","","0","","10","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the most popular class of pattern-matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick-like algorithms, which are based on constructing and traversing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), representing the patterns. While this approach ensures deterministic time guarantees, modern IDSs need to deal with hundreds of patterns, thus requiring to store very large DFAs which usually do not fit in fast memory. This results in a major bottleneck on the throughput of the IDS, as well as its power consumption and cost. We propose a novel method to compress DFAs by observing that the name of the states is meaningless. While regular DFAs store separately each transition between two states, we use this degree of freedom and encode states in such a way that all transitions to a specific state can be represented by a single prefix that defines a set of current states. Our technique applies to a large class of automata, which can be categorized by simple properties. Then, the problem of pattern matching is reduced to the well-studied problem of Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) that can be solved either in TCAM, in commercially available IP-lookup chips, or in software. Specifically, we show that with a TCAM our scheme can reach a throughput of 10 Gbps with low power consumption.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462160","","Automata;Communications Society;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Throughput;USA Councils","data compression;deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","Aho-Corasick-like algorithms;IP-lookup chips;TCAM;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;compactDFA;deterministic finite automaton;generic state machine compression;intrusion detection systems;longest prefix matching;low power consumption;power consumption;scalable pattern matching algorithms","","14","1","21","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach introduces the relevant theories of label switching path in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and makes use of routing path to set up a Trace back Path (TP). During the trace back process, we can reconstruct the attack path on the basis of label switching mechanism. We use mathematical analysis and simulations to evaluate our approach. Our evaluation results show that compared to HIT and SPIE, two state-of-art single-packet trace back approaches, the storage overhead in our approach is only related to the number of routing paths, no matter how many packets traverse on the paths, and the number of queried routers during the trace back process is only related to the number of hops in an attack path.","1066-6192","978-1-4673-0226-5","","10.1109/PDP.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6169557","","Computer crime;IP networks;Multiprotocol label switching;Routing;Routing protocols;Servers;Switches","IP networks;multiprotocol label switching;telecommunication network routing","HIT;MPLS;SPIE;demand routers;label switching path;multi-protocol label switching;routing path;single-packet IP traceback;trace back path","","1","","14","","","15-17 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While implementing Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) its major problem security is widely addressed, but various challenges still persist such as the different kinds of misbehavior of node may be exhibits, detection of routing misbehavior and collusion of misbehaving nodes has not been adequately addressed yet. One such solution to overcome selfishly behaving nodes in wireless network is to detect and exclude them .There are several secure routing protocols to detect routing misbehavior in the direct neighborhood. In this paper, we presented an improved version of Leak detector mechanism and iterative probing mechanism to detect colluding malicious nodes, manipulations of route in wireless multi hop networks. Leak detector enables the calculation of the packet-loss ratio for the individual nodes. Iterative probing enables reliable detection of selfish nodes that drop packets in a MANET. Our Simulation results of these mechanisms shows that they are highly adaptable, reliable and most effective way to identify any selfish behaviors, routing and collusion of misbehaving nodes.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019683","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019683","Iterative Probing and Collusion;Leak detector;MANET;Routing","Cryptography;Detectors;Mobile ad hoc networks;Probes;Routing;Routing protocols","iterative methods;leak detection;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","MANET;colluding malicious node detection;collusion attack;iterative probing mechanism;leak detector mechanism;mobile ad hoc network;mobile communication;packet-loss ratio;routing misbehavior detection;secure routing protocol;selfish node detection;ubiquitous network;wireless multihop network","","0","","24","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To be effective in carrying out their functions, the IDSs need to be accurate, adaptive, and extensible. Given these stringent requirements and the high level of vulnerabilities of the current days' networks, the design of an IDS has become a very challenging task. Although, an extensive research has been done on intrusion detection in a distributed environment, distributed IDSs suffer from a number of drawbacks e.g., high rates of false positives, low detection efficiency etc. In this paper, the design of a distributed IDS is proposed that consists of a group of autonomous and cooperating agents. In addition to its ability to detect attacks, the system is capable of identifying and isolating compromised nodes in the network thereby introducing fault-tolerance in its operations. The experiments conducted on the system have shown that it has high detection efficiency and low false positives compared to some of the currently existing systems.","","978-1-4244-7675-6","","10.1109/PDGC.2010.5679879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679879","","Bayesian methods;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Intrusion detection;Lead;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing","distributed processing;security of data;software agents;software fault tolerance","IDS;autonomous agents;cooperating agents;fault-tolerant distributed intrusion detection system;malicious intruders;networked system security;robust distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","10","","","28-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The deployment of sensor nodes in an optimal arrangement while overcoming the unique challenges posed by the surrounding medium and energy constraints on the sensors is a non-trivial task for real-world applications. As these characteristics are anisotropic with respect to change in temperature, salinity, depth, pH, and transmission frequency, they need to be accounted for in a dynamic simulation to preconfigure a stable physical network layout of nodes. A strategy based on computational intelligence techniques that takes into consideration these factors to achieve a viable configuration with the available resources is of prime importance. The proposed methodology uses a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique for the positioning and deployment of UWSN nodes to maximize the coverage provided to protect a high-value asset (HVA) in a military application. In the case of a civil application for ocean monitoring, the proposed technique is used to identify the minimum number of nodes required and their positions for effective communication.","","978-1-4799-8299-8","","10.1109/UT.2015.7108229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7108229","deployment strategy;genetic algorithm;modeling;simulation;underwater acoustic sensor network","Genetic algorithms;Monitoring;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Temperature sensors;Three-dimensional displays","genetic algorithms;oceanographic techniques;pH;sensor placement;telecommunication power management;underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks","HVA;UWSN;computational intelligence techniques;energy constraints;genetic algorithm;high-value asset;ocean monitoring;physical network layout;sensor nodes;transmission frequency;underwater acoustic sensor networks;underwater sensor network positioning;wireless operation","","0","","21","","","23-25 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A masquerade attack is a form of attack wherein the attacker uses someone else's identity or one system assumes the identity of another system. One extremely simple and dangerous form of a masquerade attack occurs when an attacker begins using an unattended and unlocked computer. In this paper, we present a new method for detecting this type of masquerade attack, based on the notion of how the current user interacts with the graphical user interface. This method does not use mouse movements or keystroke dynamics, rather profiles how the user manipulates the windows, icons, menus, and pointers that comprise a graphical user interface. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted some empirical studies in a real operational environment. While our results show some variations in performance, our method was able to detect up to 95% of simulated masquerade attacks with no false alarms. Furthermore, our method shows potential for use in real-time systems, requiring less data than other GUI interaction-based masquerade detection techniques while using a much simpler classification engine.","","1-4244-1304-4","1-4244-1304-4","10.1109/IAW.2007.381943","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267571","GUI usage;intrusion detection;masquerade detection;profiling","Conferences;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Manipulator dynamics;Mice;Operating systems;Real time systems;Tellurium","graphical user interfaces;security of data","GUI usage analysis;graphical user interface;masquerade attack;masquerade detection","","2","","11","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This renders the fixing of these potential faults slow and expensive. This paper proposes a system which can analyse data received from a surveillance system. The proposed system will report abnormal activities, such as malfunctioning or dead sensors, abnormal usage, and abnormal events created by the surveillance system.

In this paper, we propose an evasion technique to the Snort NIDS which exploits its flowbits feature. We specify the flowbit evasion attack and provide practical algorithms to solve it with controllable false positives and formally prove their correctness and completeness. We implemented a tool called SFET which can automatically parse a Snort rule set, generate all possible sequences that can evade it, as well as produce a patch to guard the rule set against those evasions.

The privacy of users is of paramount importance to administrators and organizations, which are reluctant to cooperate between each other and exchange network traffic traces. The main reasons behind reluctance to exchange monitored data are the protection of the users' privacy and the fear of information leakage about the internal infrastructure. Anonymization is the technique to overcome this reluctance and enhance the cooperation between different organizations with the smooth exchange of monitored data. Today, several organizations provide network traffic traces that are anonymized by software utilities or ad-hoc solutions that offer limited flexibility. The result of this approach is the creation of unrealistic traces, inappropriate for use in evaluation experiments. Furthermore, the need for fast on-line anonymization has recently emerged as cooperative defense mechanisms have to share network traffic. Our effort focuses on the design and implementation of a generic and flexible anonymization framework that provides extended functionality, covering multiple aspects of anonymization needs and allowing fine-tuning of privacy protection level. The proposed framework is composed by an anonymization application programming interface (AAPI).
