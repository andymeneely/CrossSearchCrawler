As the SIP is gaining popularity, open architecture of VoIP often makes SIP vulnerable to so many threats. The paper introduces SIP along with its different security mechanisms with the focus on attack signatures generation technique to identify the malformed SIP messages. It aims to generate various malicious SIP messages and to verify the limitations of the existing classical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in identifying the malicious messages. Then it sets out to implement an improved detection framework using the rules as regular expression. The experiments were carried out using SER as an open source SIP server, Kphone and X-lite as SIP clients and the SIPSAK as an attacking tool on a testbed architecture which was in a form of virtual environment created with VMware. The platforms used were BackTrack7 and Windows 7. The test was first performed on SNORT, an open source IDS and later by adding the improved detection rules in the configuration file of the SIP server. The successful attacks on the classical attack-signatures generation framework proved that the existing IDSs couldn't identify logical errors in the malicious SIP messages. The proposed detection module identified and rejected all kind of malicious SIP messages with acceptable processing overheads. Moreover the associated signatures database can also be incorporated into other VoIP protocols and open source IDSs like SNORT. This paper has provided the effective mechanism in creating well-formed defense against malicious SIP message attacks to ensure the integrity and security of VoIP subsystems.","","","","10.1109/SKIMA.2014.7083519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083519","Intrusion detection system;Malicious message;SIP;SQL injection;VoIP","Inspection;Internet;Protocols;Security;Servers;Standards;Syntactics","Internet telephony;client-server systems;computer network security;digital signatures;public domain software;signalling protocols;virtual machines","BackTrack7;IDS;Kphone;SER;SIP clients;SIP server;SIP-based infrastructure security;SIPSAK;SNORT;Session Initiation Protocol;VMware;VoIP communication;VoIP subsystem integrity;VoIP subsystem security;Voice over Internet Protocol communication;Windows 7;X-lite;attack signature generation technique;attack-signature generation framework;attacking tool;configuration file;detection rule improvement;intrusion detection system;logical error identification;malformed SIP message identification;malicious SIP message attacks;malicious SIP messages;malicious message attacks;malicious message identification;open architecture;open source IDS;open source SIP server;processing overheads;regular expression;security mechanisms;signaling protocol;signature database;testbed architecture;threat vulnerability;virtual environment","","0","","8","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They aim on quickly exhausting energy reserves of battery powered sensor nodes by continuously sending messages to the node, preventing the attacked node to switch to an energy saving sleep state. Sleep deprivation attacks come also in the form of sending traffic that causes a sleeping node to wake up. Sleep deprivation attacks have the potential to lessen the lifetime of typical sensor nodes from years to days or even hours. One important communication standard for sensor networks is IEEE 802.15.4 that defines cryptographic protection of frames. While many attacks like eavesdropping or modification of frames are covered by the available security mechanisms, these mechanisms do not address sleep deprivation attacks. This paper proposes a secure wake up scheme that activates a sensor node by a secure wake up radio from a sleep state only if messages from an authenticated and legitimate node are pending. A lightweight security verification scheme is used that can easily be performed without requiring the node to change to active state.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211020","security;wake-up radio;wireless sensor network","Batteries;Communication standards;Communication switching;Cryptography;Protection;Security;Sleep;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;personal area networks;security of data;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4;battery powered sensor node;energy saving sleep state;frame cryptographic protection;lightweight security verification scheme;personal area networks;secure wake up scheme;sleep deprivation attack;wireless sensor network","","5","","16","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An ad-hoc network does not have a centralized infrastructure. It is a wireless network where nodes communicate with each other through multiple hops. If the nodes in the ad-hoc network change their positions dynamically, it is called a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It has characteristics like shared physical medium, autonomous terminal, limited physical security, infrastructure less communication, Dynamic topology, large degree of freedom, self organizing capability. Such characteristics provide an open environment for users to maintain connectivity irrespective of their geographical positions but, such types of networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attack. Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector (AODV) is one of the key protocols used for routing in MANET. The security of AODV protocol can be shattered by black hole attack. A Black hole attack can devastate routing in mobile ad hoc network. A Black hole is a malevolent node that proclaims to have the shortest optimal path to the desired destination node but in reality it does not have any active path to particular destination and the packets received by the black hole from other nodes are dropped. As the black hole attack gives the fake shortest path to the destination hence in our proposed scheme, the first optimal path is discarded and the second optimal route is selected. To maintain data integrity and for prevention of black / gray hole attack hash function is used.","","978-1-4799-6895-4","","10.1109/ICRITO.2014.7014732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014732","AODV;Black hole;Cooperative Black hole;MANET;gray hole","Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV;AODV protocol;MANET;ad hoc on demand distance vector;black hole attack prevention;black-gray hole attack hash function;dynamic topology;geographical position;hash function;malevolent node;mobile ad hoc networks;physical security;wireless connectivity;wireless network","","0","","13","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To deal with these drawbacks, we present an enhanced hierarchical key management scheme using a stable and power efficient cluster management technique. Each cluster head retains the public key of its member nodes only and act as a router when dealing with nodes of other cluster members. Using this technique, the overhead on centralized server is reduced. Moreover, the need of each node storing all public keys are diminished thus minimizing the storage overhead on each node.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid access control framework, named iHAC, which combines the advantages of both Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Type Enforcement (TE) model to enable unified access control and authorization for IaaS clouds. A permission transition model is provided to dynamically assign permission to virtual machines.

Events for monitoring computing networks occur at different system levels. Some information might relate to data, some might be operating system specific, some application or service related, some could be network related, and from each there will be compound events that describe incident effects and information about the situation context. All together there can be thousands of events per second. Today's approaches to monitoring networks are typically centralized, sending events over the network to a single engine for analysis. Centralized monitoring ultimately cannot scale to address the volume of events that one would ideally like to be able to monitor, so techniques of today often make severe compromises relating to the events that they ingest. Centralized monitoring creates a single point of failure and also generates significant network load. To overcome these deficiencies we have developed a more distributed, approach: our reasoner agents can (in theory) be installed on every monitored resources and the reasoner language (used for programming the reasoners) enables knowledge in a reasoner's working memory to be synchronized over multiple reasoners enabling them to implement parallel distributed reasoning algorithms that are able detect event patterns irrespective of whether the events are local or remote. Distributing the reasoning makes the system extremely resilient. Additionally, since the knowledge shared between the reasoning agents represents summary information, and because many on-line event correlation algorithms often suppress reporting once an incident has been reported, the amount of network load needed to support the distributed monitoring can actually be reduced. To demonstrate our approach we describe its application to the monitoring of a computing network that has been instrumented to protect it - - against 0-day email virus attacks.","2155-7578","978-1-4244-8178-1","","10.1109/MILCOM.2010.5680347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680347","autonomic response;distributed reasoning;event correlation;intelligent agents;network and security monitoring;parallel programs","Cognition;Correlation;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Sensors;Servers;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;computer viruses;electronic mail;inference mechanisms;parallel processing","Otto-Mate;computing networks;email virus attacks;operating system;parallel distributed reasoning algorithms;parallel distributed reasoning system;reasoner language;reasoning agents","","0","","11","","","Oct. 31 2010-Nov. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 22nd International Symposium on","20031020","2003","","","260","269","A large class of security attacks exploit software implementation vulnerabilities such as unchecked buffers. This paper proposes transparent runtime randomization (TRR), a generalized approach for protecting against a wide range of security attacks. TRR dynamically and randomly relocates a program's stack, heap, shared libraries, and parts of its runtime control data structures inside the application memory address space. Making a program's memory layout different each time it runs foils the attacker's assumptions about the memory layout of the vulnerable program and makes the determination of critical address values difficult if not impossible.

Among various data-leak cases, human mistakes are one of the main causes of data loss. There exist solutions detecting inadvertent sensitive data leaks caused by human mistakes and to provide alerts for organizations. A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider. We describe how Internet service providers can offer their customers DLD as an add-on service with strong privacy guarantees. The evaluation results show that our method can support accurate detection with very small number of false alarms under various data-leak scenarios.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038200","Data leak;collection intersection;network security;privacy","Data models;Data privacy;Electronic mail;Organizations;Privacy;Protocols;Security","Internet;computer network security;data privacy","DLD;Internet service provider;add-on service;data leak detection;privacy preserving detection;sensitive data exposure","","0","","56","","2015-02-10","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

If the critical components are isolated in VMs,access control can be enforced or attestation can be made when the subject is accessing via VMs. In this way, VMs can improve the security level of critical components such as OS, kernel, data, and applications.

However, collaboration of intermediate nodes is not guaranteed and non-collaborative nodes may drop packets they are asked to forward. Such behaviour, known as packet dropping, results of nodespsila selfishness or maliciousness and has dramatic effects on networks performances. Most of proposed solutions to counter packet dropping are either based on trust management or multipath routing, but no solution combines both trust management and multipath routing. Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a security framework which adapts security to the application requirements; evaluates trustworthy relationship based on localized trust model and efficiently combines multipath routing into trust management. In this paper we study ASMA performance against the most classical and simple packet dropping attack: Black Hole attack. Aiming to evaluate ASMA in dense networks, we use a realistic scenario representing a subway environment which brings interesting features and may be a prolific context for MANET application development. Through simulations we compare the performances of DSR and ASMA associated to DSR in attacked pure MANETs. Simulation results illustrate that ASMA-DSR outperforms DSR under different attack configurations and is totally adapted for dense and large networks.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-2702-4","978-1-4244-2703-1","10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625667","","Authentication;Collaboration;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Performance analysis;Robustness;Routing protocols;Security;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunications","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","ASMA performances;adaptive secured multipath;black hole attack;dense networks;forward packets;localized trust model;mobile ad hoc networks;multihop transmissions;multipath routing;nodes collaboration;packet dropping;packet dropping attacks;route packets;trust management","","0","","11","","","6-9 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, with the growing use of virtual private networks (VPNs) that encrypt network traffic, the NIDS can no longer analyse the encrypted data. This essentially negates any protection offered by the NIDS. Although the encrypted traffic can be decrypted at a network gateway for analysis, this compromises on data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a detection framework which allows a traditional NIDS to continue functioning, without compromising the confidentiality afforded by the VPN. Our approach uses Shamir's secret-sharing scheme and randomised network proxies to enable detection of malicious activities in encrypted channels. Additionally, this approach is able to detect any malicious attempts to forge network traffic with the intention of evading detection. Our experiments show that the probability of a successful evasion is low, at about 0.98% in the worst case. We implement our approach in a prototype and present some preliminary results. Overall, the proposed approach is able to consistently detect intrusions and does not introduce any additional false positives.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066523","encrypted network;intrusion detection;malicious proxy;secret-sharing","Availability;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Virtual private networks","cryptography;probability;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","NIDS;Shamir's secret-sharing scheme;VPN;encrypted network traffic;malicious activity detection;network-based intrusion detection system;probability;virtual private network","","1","","10","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 34th Conference on","20091218","2009","","","899","906","Packet classification is one of the crucial components of application such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services. For example, an intrusion detection system (IDS) classifies packets either as benign or malicious and alerts the network administrator when hostile traffic is detected. Since existing IDS spend the majority of CPU time in packet classification, an IDS fails to detect malicious packets under high load. Many ideas have been proposed to make the packet inspection faster so that an IDS spends less time in packet classification. However, because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands, requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. As a result, an IDS spends longer time to classify packets since each packet incurs many memory accesses, and thus the throughput of an IDS is limited by memory bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by exploiting locality in traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose npf, a fast and traffic-adaptive packet classifier which dynamically reorganizes the internal data structure based on the traffic pattern. Unlike existing approaches requiring a separate, off-line reorganization phase, npf performs reorganization on-line with little overhead, resulting in higher throughput without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on our test bed show that npf outperforms a traditional packet classifier by spending an order of magnitude less time per packet in order to classify the packet.","","978-1-4244-4488-5","978-1-4244-4487-8","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355038","","Classification tree analysis;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer security;Databases;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer network security;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS througput;internal data structure;intrusion detection system;malicious packet detection;memory access;memory bandwidth;network administrator;npf traffic-adaptive packet classifier;online reorganization;packet classification;packet inspection;rule trees;security threats","","0","","23","","","20-23 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This allows potential attackers to infiltrate the network and carry out attacks on its participants with the purpose of stealing or altering information. A specific type of attack, the Wormhole attack does not require exploiting any nodes in the network and can interfere with the route establishment process. The entire routing system in MANET can even be brought down using the wormhole attack.

Indeed, the security of guest virtual machines and of the applications and services they host can be improved by leveraging the additional architectural layer introduced by such a technology. This paper discusses security management for virtualized environments and provides several contributions. First, a novel architecture (Kvm-SMA) with the following features is detailed: it can protect guest integrity from both remote and local attacks such as root-kits, viruses, and worms; it is not circumventable and it is completely transparent to guest machines; it can asynchronously analyze guest data and monitor guest system behavior. Second, the proposed architecture has been implemented entirely on open source software and can be replicated to both Linux and Windows guests. Third the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture is shown. The former is proved showing the results of root-kit detection test, while the latter is supported by standard performance tests showing that the introduced overhead is small. Finally, a distinguishing feature of our monitoring system proposal is that it is immune to timing attacks: that is, an adversary cannot notice the monitoring system is active by analyzing the time required to perform system calls. We believe that security management of both single virtualized hosts and distributed virtualized systems can benefit from our proposal.","","978-1-4244-7547-6","","10.1109/CIT.2010.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578474","Malware;Security;Virtualization technology","Computer architecture;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","Kvm-SMA;distributed virtualized system;kernel virtual machine;root-kit detection test;security management architecture","","1","","15","","","June 29 2010-July 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols.

At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks. The empirical results demonstrate that dual-variant execution has on average 17 percent performance overhead when deployed on multicore processors.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714703","Intrusion detection;multivariant execution;n-variant execution;system call.","Kernel;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Security;Synchronization;Writing","computer crime;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","asynchronous signal;attack detection;code injection attack;computer systems attack;dual variant execution;false alarm;intrusion detection system;monitoring mechanism;multicore processor;multiprocess application;multithreaded application;multivariant execution technique;replicated execution","","5","1","45","","2011-02-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed system is designed to deal the fragmented and out-of-order packets. Fragmentation is the term given to the process of breaking down an IP datagram into smaller packets to be transmitted over different types of network media and then reassembling them at the other end. In most cases, depending upon the actual security device defending the network, there are typically multiple fragmentation techniques and packet size combinations capable of squeezing and exploiting protection device on a network. We present an efficient multi pattern algorithm for regular expression matching on streams with fragmented and out of order data, while maintaining a small state and without complete stream reconstruction. It improves the performance of Intrusion Detection System for detecting the fragmented and Out-of-Order packet attack. The proposed technique helps to achieve high throughput while limiting both memory-usage and memory-bandwidth on fragmented data packets intrusion.","","978-1-4799-3925-1","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726491","Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA);Intrusion Detection System(IDS);Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU);Network Intrusion Detection Syterm(NIDS)","Automata;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Out of order;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Silicon","deterministic automata;finite state machines;pattern matching;security of data","DFA;IP datagram;deterministic finite-state automata;intrusion detection system;multipattern matching technique;multiple fragmentation techniques;out-of-order packet attack;out-of-order packet streams","","0","","14","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key features of the Swift include: 1) extremely low filter update latency for dynamic packet filtering, and 2) gigabits-per-second high-speed packet processing. Based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architecture (ISA), Swift achieves the former with an instruction set design that avoids the need for compilation and security checking, and the latter by mainly utilizing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD). We implement Swift in the Linux 2.6 kernel for both i386 and x86_64 architectures and extensively evaluate its dynamic and static filtering performance on multiple machines with different hardware setups. We compare Swift to BPF (the BSD packet filter)-the de facto standard for packet filtering in modern operating systems-and hand-coded optimized C filters that are used for demonstrating possible performance gains. For dynamic filtering tasks, Swift is at least three orders of magnitude faster than BPF in terms of filter update latency. For static filtering tasks, Swift outperforms BPF up to three times in terms of packet processing speed and achieves much closer performance to the optimized C filters. We also show that Swift can harness the processing power of hardware SIMD instructions by virtue of its SIMD-capable instruction set.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2111381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5719540","Linux kernel networking;packet filter","Band pass filters;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Protocols;Security","information filters;information networks;instruction sets;parallel processing","BSD packet filter;Linux;complex instruction set computer;fast dynamic packet filter;high performance packet;high speed packet processing;instruction set architecture;multiple machines;single instruction multiple data","","0","","29","","2011-02-24","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The assessment is based upon experimental work that is conducted on a controlled environment. User-to-user network performance software is used to obtain the throughput, round trip time and tunneling overhead for TCP and UDP transmission protocol. The performance of TCP and UDP through 6 to 4 tunnel is then compared over the native IPv4 and IPv6 environment.

This methodology introduces four parameters, Possibility, Cost, Profit, and Damage to delineate any assumed attack or threat. By studying these parameters together, it becomes clear what are the most probable and considerable misbehaviors, how much damage they can make, what are profits and cost of such a behavior for the hostile host, and so how much essential is to tackle it. Comparison of PCPD parameters for different types of misbehavior results in a comprehensible identification of their severity, network's reliability, and network's weak points.

A gray-box anomaly detector first observes benign executions of a computer program and then extracts reliable rules that govern the normal execution of the program. However, such observations from benign executions are not necessarily true evidences supporting the rules learned. For example, the observation that a file descriptor being equal to a socket descriptor should not be considered supporting a rule governing the two values to be the same. Ground truthing such observations is a difficult problem since it is not practical to analyze the semantics of every instruction in every program to be protected. In this paper, we propose using taint analysis to automatically help the ground truthing. Intuitively, the same taint source of two values provides ground truth of the data dependence. We implement a host-based anomaly detector with our proposed taint tracking and evaluate the accuracy of rules learned. Results show that we not only manage to filter out incorrect rules that would otherwise be learned (with high support and confidence), but manage recover good rules that are previously believed to be unreliable. We also present overheads of our system and time needed for training.","","978-1-4577-0458-1","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059956","anomaly detection;ground truthing;system call monitor;taint analysis","Analytical models;Detectors;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Semantics;Sockets;Training","security of data","file descriptor;gray box anomaly detection;ground truthing observations;host based anomaly detector;socket descriptor;taint analysis;zero day exploits","","2","","24","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a distributed setting, each event is discovered by a sensor and reported to a robot. Here, we present novel algorithms aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of several existing solutions. We propose pairwise distance based matching algorithm (PDM) to eliminate long edges by pairwise exchanges between matching pairs. Our sequence dispatch algorithm (SQD) iteratively finds the closest event-robot pair, includes the event in dispatch schedule of the selected robot and updates its position accordingly. When event-robot distances are multiplied by robot resistance (inverse of the remaining energy), the corresponding energy-balanced variants are obtained. We also present generalizations which handle multiple visits and timing constraints. Our localized algorithm MAD is based on information mesh infrastructure and local auctions within the robot network for obtaining the optimal dispatch schedule for each robot.

To achieve this goal each of the stored signatures represents a description of an attack or an undesired event in the monitored network. The main weakness with existing signature matching algorithms is that they are essentially serial operations and it is hard for them to keep up with the growing network speed. The major bottleneck in intrusion detection systems is that they are able to scan only one byte at a time, which leads to increased latency and low throughput. Thus, there is a need for a novel approach which takes advantage of the increased computing power of newer architectures. This paper presents a method which uses the Cell architecture to run an adapted speculative parallel pattern matching algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the advantages brought by our of our approach are significant compared to the serial implementation and other parallel ones.

PEGs also facilitate derivation of both static and dynamic scheduling techniques,depending on the amount of variability in task execution times and other operating conditions. We show how to implement efficient PEG-based scheduling methods using real time operating systems, and to re-use pre-optimized libraries of DSP components within such implementations. Empirical results show that the PEG strategy can 1) achieve significant speedups on a state of the art multicore signal processor platform for static dataflow applications with predictable execution times,and 2) exceed classical scheduling speedups for application shaving execution times that can vary dynamically. This ability to handle variable execution times is especially useful as DSP applications and platforms increase in complexity and adaptive behavior, thereby reducing execution time predictability.","2160-0511","978-1-4673-2243-0","978-0-7695-4768-8","10.1109/ASAP.2012.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341457","Data?ow Graphs;Digital Signal Processing;Multiprocessor Dynamic Scheduling","Digital signal processing;Dynamic scheduling;Multicore processing;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules","protocols;radio networks;signal processing","DSP applications;DSP components;PEG;digital signal processing;dynamic adaptation;dynamic scheduling opportunities;dynamic scheduling techniques;exposing parallelism;online reconfiguration;partial expansion graphs;real time operating systems;wireless communications protocols","","1","","16","","","9-11 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Advancements in sensor networks enable a wide range of environmental monitoring and object tracking applications.

Therefore, biologically inspired algorithms are reviewed and enhanced to tackle problems arise in WSN. Ant routing and human self security systems have shown an excellent performance for WSNs. Certain parameters like energy level, link quality, lose rate are considered while making decision.

These networks utilize ad-hoc routing protocols to interconnecting all nodes. Each peer forwards data for other nodes on the basis of network connectivity and a set of conventions that is determined by the routing protocol. Still, these protocols fail to protect legitimate nodes against several types of selfish and malicious activity. Thus, trust and reputation schemes are integrated with pure routing protocols to provide secure routing functionality. In this paper we propose ModConTR - a modular and adaptable trust and reputation-based system for secure routing. The system is composed of 11 different components which can be configured at runtime to adjust to each application's security and performance requirements. Presented work includes three possible configurations of ModConTR, considering ultra-lightweight, low-cost and lightweight implementations. Moreover, predefined configurations permit the implementation of the reasoning process for well-known secure routing protocols. Thus, we present a security and performance analysis for each of the components, including a comparative analysis of 10 complete trust and reputation schemes under identical attack scenarios. ModConTR is implemented using the NS2 simulator and is integrated with the DSR routing protocol.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073179","DSR;NS2;ad hoc routing;comparative analysis;reputation;secure routing;trust","Ad hoc networks;Fading;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DSR routing protocol;Internet-of-things;ModConTR;NS2 simulator;ad-hoc networks;ad-hoc routing protocols;distributed wireless networks;identical attack scenarios;modular-and-configurable trust-and-reputation-based system;network connectivity;node interconnection;secure routing functionality","","0","","21","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

P2-AC organizes the transition rules in multiple stages and processes in pipeline manner, which significantly simplifies the DFA state transition graph into a character tree that only contains forwarding edges. In each stage, parallel SRAMs are used to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Transition rules can be efficiently stored and accessed in one cycle. The memory cost is less than 47% of the best known AC-based methods. P2-AC supports incremental update and scales well with the increasing number of strings.

The design of countermeasures that detect or prevent such vulnerabilities or protect against their exploitation is an important research challenge for the fields of software engineering and security engineering. In this paper, we focus on one specific type of implementation vulnerability, namely, broken dependencies on session data. This vulnerability can lead to a variety of erroneous behavior at runtime and can easily be triggered by a malicious user by applying attack techniques such as forceful browsing. This paper shows how to guarantee the absence of runtime errors due to broken dependencies on session data in Web applications. The proposed solution combines development-time program annotation, static verification, and runtime checking to provably protect against broken data dependencies. We have developed a prototype implementation of our approach, building on the JML annotation language and the existing static verification tool ESC/Java2, and we successfully applied our approach to a representative J2EE-based e-commerce application. We show that the annotation overhead is very small, that the performance of the fully automatic static verification is acceptable, and that the performance overhead of the runtime checking is limited.","0098-5589","","","10.1109/TSE.2007.70742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359468","Data sharing;Reliability;Security;Security and Protection;Software/Program Verification;Web technologies;Web-based services","","Web services;programming languages","J2EE-based e-commerce application;JML annotation language;Web application vulnerabilities;provable protection;security engineering;session data dependencies;software engineering","","2","1","48","","","Jan.-Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Asymmetric cryptography is a very useful solution to provide a secure environment in multihop networks where intermediate nodes are able to read, drop or change messages before resending them. However, storing all keys in every node by this approach is inefficient, if practically possible, in large-scale MANETs due to some limitations such as memory or process capability. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic key management algorithm for large-scale MANETs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method which probabilistically uses asymmetric cryptography to manage the keys in MANETs. In this algorithm, we store only a few keys in each node instead of all. We analytically prove that the network will remain connected with a high probability more than 99:99%. Furthermore, we analytically calculate the average path length in the network and show that this parameter will not have a significant increment using our algorithm. All analytical results are also validated by simulation to make them dependable.","","978-1-4673-6239-9","978-0-7695-4952-1","10.1109/WAINA.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550422","Asymmetric Cryptography;Connectivity;Large Scale MANETs;Probabilistic Key Management","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Probabilistic logic;Probability;Public key","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication security","asymmetric cryptography;intermediate node;large-scale MANET;memory;mobile ad hoc network;multihop network;network path length;probabilistic key management algorithm;probability;process capability;secure environment;security","","1","","40","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy.

In contrast to other intrusion detection system based on collective decision, MAPIDS saves more bandwidth and energy and it is immune to sparse nodes problem.","","0-7695-2405-2","","10.1109/PDCAT.2005.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1578953","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer science;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Voting","","","","1","","13","","","05-08 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging reduce the difference between this variant and the original program to a minimal repair. We describe the algorithm and report experimental results of its success on 16 programs totaling 1.25 M lines of C code and 120K lines of module code, spanning eight classes of defects, in 357 seconds, on average.

This is emphasized by the fact that virtual machines are abruptly migrated between physical hosts, in the same or even in different data centers under different security policies. If security is not correctly enforced at the destination locations, and not properly updated in the source locations, security of the migrating virtual machine as well as the co-located machines can be compromised. In this paper, we intend to tackle this problem, specifically for intrusion detection/prevention and VPN/IPsec as main security mechanisms. More precisely, we propose a systematic verification approach to check the compliance of security configurations. To this end, we first elaborate on two properties, namely intrusion monitoring configuration preservation and VPN/IPsec protection configuration preservation. Then, we derive a set of formulas that compare security configurations before and after migration. This allows reasoning on whether the aforementioned security properties hold. To this end, we encode these formulas as constraint satisfaction problems. The obtained constraints are then submitted to a constraint solver, namely Sugar, in order to verify the properties and to pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903454","Cloud Computing;Intrusion Detection;Security;VPN/IPsec;Verification","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sugar;Virtual machining;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;computer centres;constraint satisfaction problems;security of data;virtual machines","VPN-IPsec protection configuration preservation;cloud computing;co-located machines;constraint satisfaction problems;data centers;intrusion monitoring configuration preservation;physical hosts;pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems;security configuration preservation;security mechanisms;security policies;security properties;systematic verification approach;virtual machines","","0","","26","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many improvements have been applied to this library but it still suffers from several performance flaws that are due not to the software itself but rather to the underlying hardware bottlenecks. In this paper we present a new traffic monitoring device, implemented by an Intel IXP2400 Network Processor PCI-X card connected to a gigabit Ethernet LAN hosting a cluster of common personal computers running any libpcap based application.

On the other hand, we are witnessing an increasing number of zero day attacks. Our analysis confirms that Local Area Networks are highly vulnerable to such attacks since there is free communication between the hosts in the LAN. A single compromised host can severely degrade the services in the traditional LAN and it is extremely difficult task for the security administrator to determine the compromised host that is generating attack traffic. In this paper we propose techniques to enhance the security in traditional LAN by making use of the trusted computing and virtualisation technologies. Often virtualisation is considered as a technology which enables to run multiple computers on a single server. We will show that virtualisation technology has significant benefits even if a single virtual machine is hosted on each VMM. Our model enables the security administrator to enforce security policies on the traffic that can be placed on the LAN medium. Hence our model efficiently deals with the attack at the VMM that is hosting the compromised virtual machine. The security can be enhanced furthermore by using the TPM technology to secure the virtualized local area networks. We will also present detail analysis of different cases scenarios on how the proposed model can enhance the security of the local area networks. There are several advantages with our model. Emerging attacks such as Conficker remain dormant in our proposed architecture in order to avoid detection.

Internet situation awareness can be accomplished by creating a common basis for private and public operators to monitor their networks. Thus, an overlay monitoring layer is needed, which can be utilized to address a very important aspect for a more secure and trustworthy Internet. This is the need of various stakeholders to have the information they need to perform their decision tasks in a reliable fashion. This can be accomplished by offering them a common smart approach and the additional benefit of a global view, which they can use to compare their local situation with. This smart approach should utilize well proven existing global statistics, best practices and existing technical sensors, which can be adapted to the overall common framework. From this, output for all relevant stakeholders, like national assessments centers, can be generated to fulfill the individual needs. One possible input source could be the technical sensor technology, which has been developed by our Institute for Internet security and which we give to partners and other researchers free of charge. It is a great basis for an Internet situation awareness, since it is a well proven system, which has been in operation for a couple of years, and since it can easily be adapted by our developers to comply with the overall framework. The great advantages are in addition (i) that it is privacy compliant by design and (ii) can offer high performance with the (iii) capability for long time storage of the collected raw data.

For the ease of development, complex packet processing algorithms are often implemented at the user-space level. As a result, performance benchmarks for packet processing algorithms often show a great gap when packets are input from different sources. An algorithm that performs well by reading packets from a raw packet trace file may get a worse result when it reads packets directly from a network interface. Such a phenomenon gets much worse when the algorithm is going to process packets in-line. In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of existing in-line packet processing implementations in the Linux operating system. Based on the observation, a new software architecture, named Fast Queue, is proposed and implemented to show that the identified bottleneck can be effectively eliminated. Experiments show that the proposed software architecture reduces 30% of CPU utilization.

The RMR protocol reactively discovers routes over spatial cells whose local reliabilities are distributed throughout the network via a fast dissemination algorithm. By using a spatial approach where reliability and trust are attributed to space rather than to nodes, RMR is able to find reliable routes that persist for longer durations than those discovered by node-centric protocols. Furthermore, RMR is capable of reliable geocasting with low overhead. Via QualNet simulation studies, we compare the performance of the RMR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and overhead, and quantify the effects of node density, velocity, and traffic load on protocol performance. Our results indicate that the RMR protocol performs well in high mobility, high density scenarios because of its controlled routing overhead and spatial approach to routing.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.111204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081347","Mobile ad hoc networks;Reliability;Routing protocols;Trust","Mathematical model;Military communication;Reliability;Routing protocols","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","QualNet simulation;RMR protocol;dissemination algorithm;node density;node-centric protocol;packet delivery ratio;quality of service metric;reliability map routing protocol;tactical mobile ad hoc network;traffic load","","2","","30","","","December 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The problem of incentives and efficiency are well known problems that can be addressed in such collaborative environment. In this paper, we propose to use game theory to improve detection and optimize intrusion detection systems used in collaboration. The main contribution of this paper is that the reputation of HIDS is evaluated before modeling the game between the HIDS and attackers. Our proposal has three phases: the first phase builds reputation evaluation between HIDS and estimates the reputation for each one. In the second phase, a proposed algorithm elects a leader using reputation value to make decisions. In the last phase, using game theory the leader decides to activate or not the HIDS for optimization reasons.","","","","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693381","False Alarm;Game Theory;Intrusion Detection;Resource Consumption","Collaboration;Game theory;Games;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Vectors","computer crime;game theory;groupware","HIDS;attackers;collaborative intrusion detection;game theory;heterogenous networks;host-based intrusion detection systems;incentives;malicious behaviors detection;reputation aggregation;reputation evaluation;reputation-based distributed intrusion detection","","0","","21","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In IDMTM, we employ two new concepts: ""Evidence Chain (EC)"" and ""Trust Fluctuation (TF)"" to accurately evaluate the trust value of a node in the network for judging whether it is malicious or not. Comparing with other Intrusion Detection System, IDMTM can greatly decrease the possibility of false-alarm with by efficiently utilizing the information collected from the local node and the neighboring nodes. Also, IDMTM can efficiently isolate internal malicious nodes from the networks and enhance the security without compromising the performance of the networks.","1550-445X","978-0-7695-3095-6","","10.1109/AINA.2008.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4482812","Ad hoc;evidence;intrusion;trust","Ad hoc networks;Application software;Computer networks;Computer security;Fluctuations;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","IDMTM;based on trust model;evidence chain;intrusion detection mechanism;mobile ad hoc networks;trust fluctuation","","5","","12","","","25-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to prevent inside attackers, it should be accompanied with an intrusion detection system (IDS). In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing with an integrated localized key management (SR-LKM) protocol, which is aimed to prevent both inside and outside attackers. The localized key management mechanism is not dependent on any routing protocol. Thus, unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol does not suffer from the key management - secure routing interdependency problem. The key management mechanism is lightweight as it optimizes the use of public key cryptography with the help of a novel neighbor based handshaking and Least Common Multiple (LCM) based broadcast key distribution mechanism. The protocol is storage scalable and its efficiency is confirmed by the results obtained from simulation experiments.","1550-445X","978-1-4799-3629-8","","10.1109/AINA.2014.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838720","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Key Management;Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET);Secure Routing","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Mobile computing;Public key;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;public key cryptography;routing protocols","MANET;broadcast key distribution mechanism;integrated localized key management protocol;intrusion detection system;key management protocol;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor based handshaking and least common multiple;public key cryptography;routing protocol;routing security","","1","","18","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the fact that numerous services provide information regarding the threat level of the Internet, they are mostly based on information acquired by their sensors or on offline statistical sampling of various security applications (antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, etc.). This paper introduces proactive threat observatory system (PROTOS), an open-source early warning system that does not require a commercial license and is capable of estimating the threat level across the Internet. The proposed system utilises both a global and a local approach, and is thus able to determine whether a specific host is under an imminent threat, as well as to provide an estimation of the malicious activity across the Internet. Apart from these obvious advantages, PROTOS supports a large-scale installation and can be extended even further to improve the effectiveness by incorporating prediction and forecasting techniques.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2014.000070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6896564","Computer virus;forecasting;intrusion detection;security;time series","Computer architecture;Databases;Internet;Security;Sensor systems;Servers","Internet;computer network security;computer viruses;public domain software","DDoS;Internet threat level estimation;PROTOS;distributed denial-of-service attacks;distributed-complex system;forecasting technique;global-local approach;large-scale installation;malicious activity estimation;malware;open-source early warning system;prediction technique;proactive threat observatory system","","0","","30","","","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper examines the spread of a class of hitlist-based worms that attempt to propagate by searching for address book files on the host system and using the host's mail program to spread to the addresses found. This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected. This paper provides a complete description of a method to allow for better containment of this class of worms.

This paper presents the design and implementation of DiMAPI, an application programming interface for distributed passive network monitoring. DiMAPI extends the notion of the network flow with the scope attribute, which enables flow creation and manipulation over a set of local and remote monitoring sensors. Experiments with a number of applications on top of DiMAPI show that it has reasonable performance, while the response latency is very close to the actual round trip time between the monitoring application and the monitoring sensors.

And it detects SYN flooding and finds victims more accurately in its second stage. To make the detection mechanism robustly and easily, D-SAT uses CUSUM (cumulative sum) approach in SPC (statistical process control) (H. Wang et al., 2002) (D.C. Montgomery, 2001) (D.M.

Apart from reducing the processing overhead through minimization of the feature space, the autonomous identification of such sub-groups of features can readily enable IDS's to develop classifiers that are more apt at separating normal traffic from anomalous traffic.
