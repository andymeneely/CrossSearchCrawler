As a result, all vulnerable message fields that could be tampered with during transmission are protected by our method. The proposed SIDM is lightweight and deployable in a distributed environment.

Mobile agents are shown most scalable and robust for policy update, but prone to attacks by other agents or hosts.

Then, we introduce an analytical model to evaluate the time of detection and the overhead (number of messages) of our collaborative watchdog approach.

One important specification of such systems is high availability. Recent attacks to ICS illustrate that almost any cyber attack can be orchestrated on these systems. Current security techniques, tools, and methods cannot prevent these cyber attacks. Attacks may finally lead to malfunctioning or even disabling the ICS for a long time. The consequences are financial loss and in some cases, catastrophic events affecting our lives. Two solutions can improve the availability: increasing the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) or decreasing the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Current approaches which try to improve the security of ICS use the first solution. Nevertheless, decreasing the MTTR is more effective thus a recovery scheme for ICS is proposed here. Using the proposed scheme, the ICS is recovered from a compromised state and is put into a stable state. Preliminary experiments show that this scheme can significantly decrease the MTTR and improve the ICS availability.","","978-1-4673-6489-8","","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620079","Industrial Control System;Recovery;Security;System availability","Availability;Control systems;Educational institutions;Industrial control;Security;Servers;Workstations","industrial control;reliability;system recovery","ICS availability;MTTF;MTTR;cyber attack;industrial control systems;mean time to failure;mean time to recovery;recovery scheme","","0","","17","","","28-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It uses a bi-path routing algorithm to decrease the computational overhead as well as energy dissipation in the nodes. A key pre-distribution scheme is proposed such that nodes in the route share keys while those that are not in the route do not share keys with nodes that are in the route. Simulations have been done for both small and large areas, low and high density, on-route and non-route connectivity scenarios.

To meet the processing demands of high-performance networks, multi-processor systems-on-a-chip with dozens of cores are employed to provide raw processing power. Management of these processors and other system resources to achieve high forwarding rates is a key challenge. In particular, the allocation of processing workloads and the placement of data structures in memory have an enormous impact on system performance. Our work proposes a runtime system that manages these system resources. Much related work has proposed the use of cache memory hierarchies in packet processors.

The Bayesian method has been used in the past on weather forecasting and has been expanded so that it can be used to provide enhanced network security by trying to predict user actions. For this a system can determine if a user is acting unpredictably or has changed their normal working pattern. Results are also given which show that the new model can predict user actions, and a set of experiments are proposed for further exploitation of the method.","","0-7695-1086-8","","10.1109/ECBS.2001.922429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=922429","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Operating systems;Predictive models;Software libraries;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Weather forecasting","belief networks;computer networks;cryptography;message authentication","agent-based Bayesian forecasting model;enhanced network security;network security;operating systems;password system;user ID;user authentication","","3","","24","","","2001","17 Apr 2001-20 Apr 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such actions include traffic remapping attacks (TRAs), which consist in claiming a higher traffic priority, i.e., false designation of the intrinsic traffic class so that it can be mapped onto a higher-priority class. In practice, TRAs can be executed in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks using the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function. This attack is easy to perform yet hard to prevent. We propose a distributed discouragement scheme based on the threat of TRA detection and punishment. The scheme does not rely on station identities or a trusted third party, nor does it require tampering with the MAC protocol. We analyze an arising non-cooperative TRA game and find that under certain realistic assumptions it only incentivizes TRAs if they are harmless to other stations; otherwise the selfish stations are induced to learn that TRAs are counterproductive.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2321577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6810022","Ad hoc networks;EDCA;IEEE 802.11;QoS;game theory;selfish behavior;traffic remapping attack","Ad hoc networks;Games;IEEE 802.11 Standards;IP networks;Quality of service;Throughput;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;game theory;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN;wireless channels","EDCA;IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network;TRA detection;TRA punishment;class-based approach;distributed discouragement scheme;enhanced distributed channel access;false intrinsic traffic class designation;higher traffic priority class;local ad hoc network;noncooperative TRA game;quality of service;traffic remapping attack","","0","","38","","2014-05-02","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet.

Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are networks that combine wireless communication with a high degree of node mobility. Hence they are vulnerable and are subjected to new security risks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are an important area of research which acts as a second line of defense against unauthorized activities in networks. The effectiveness of IDS is measured by the response it generates specific to the type of intrusion detected. In this paper, we have proposed and simulated an enhanced detection mechanism in a Zone based Intrusion Detection System (ZBIDS). An extensive simulation is carried out to study the performance of ZBIDS under various routing attacks like blackhole, greyhole, wormhole and impersonation. The simulation results are based on the proposed architecture and shows that the enhanced ZBIDS has achieved desirable performance to meet the security requirement of MANETs.","","978-1-4673-6822-3","","10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219887","Zone based intrusion detection system;blackhole attack;grayhole attack;impersonation;wormhole attack","Ad hoc networks;Color;Computer architecture;Engines;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Routing","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ZBIDS;blackhole;greyhole;mobile ad hoc networks;wireless communication;wireless networking;wormhole;zone based intrusion detection system","","0","","22","","","26-28 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose new NFA-Split architecture, which reduces the amount of consumed FPGA resources in order to match larger set of regular expressions at multi-gigabit speed. The proposed reduction uses model of nondeterministic and deterministic automaton for effective mapping of regular expressions to FPGA. A new algorithm is designed to split the nondeterministic automaton transition table in order to map a part of the table into memory. The algorithm can place more than 49% of transition table to memory, which reduces the amount of look-up tables by more than 43% and flip-flops by more than 38% for all selected sets of regular expressions. Moreover, a sparse transition table is mapped to memory with overlapped rows, which enables to store the table in a highly compact form.","","978-1-4244-6612-2","","10.1109/DDECS.2010.5491816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491816","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Field programmable gate arrays;Flip-flops;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;deterministic automata;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching","FPGA;NFA-Split architecture;deterministic automaton;fast regular expression matching;flip flops;intrusion detection systems;look-up tables;malicious attacks;network attacks;nondeterministic automaton transition table;pattern matching;sparse transition table;viruses","","2","","21","","","14-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our results show that the behaviour of our algorithm depends only on the packet arrival rate: delay in detecting the signature grows linearly with respect to the packet arrival rate and with small communication overhead.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218423","","Automata;Computers;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Synchronization","computer network security;multipath channels;telecommunication traffic","asynchronous online exact string matching problem;distributed signature-based intrusion;intrusion signatures;multi-path routing attacks;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet arrival rate","","0","","21","","","April 26 2015-May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The automation system usually contains a rather accurate time source, which could be used to derive the time base for all system components, including the above-mentioned security mechanisms. A number of standard protocols exist for time synchronization. It will be shown that these protocols do not fulfill the necessary security requirements.

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed.

We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost.

The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice.

The evaluation order of selection constructs can significantly influence the overall performance of multiple query evaluation. Consequently, based on the filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence of selection constructs dynamically captured at run-time, a selection-early strategy establishes the efficient evaluation sequence adaptively. For this purpose, the overall filtering capability of the current evaluation sequence is periodically monitored and the sequence is rearranged when its filtering capability is varied higher than a specific threshold. Accordingly, this strategy keeps the current evaluation sequence to be as efficient as possible by coping with a dynamic variation of its filtering capability. The experimental studies of the proposed strategy show that it is practically more scalable and stable than other approaches.","","978-1-4673-2087-0","","10.1109/ComManTel.2013.6482420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6482420","ASC;PSC;XML stream;adaptive query optimization;data stream;multiple continuous queries;relational stream;selection-early strategy","Filtering;Monitoring;Optimization;Query processing;Routing;Synthetic aperture sonar;XML","","","","0","","10","","","21-24 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","0","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo. Moreover, ns-2 simulation results show that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged, while energy savings of 20 to 100 times are achieved, depending on the scenario.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654513","Sensor networks;local monitoring;malicious nodes.;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna","Antennas;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Sleep;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","ELMO;WSN;energy aware local monitoring;energy constrained system;energy consumption;local monitoring based security algorithm;sleep wake management;wireless sensor network","","3","","40","","2010-12-03","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"On the use of security analytics for attack detection in vehicular ad hoc networks","Gantsou, D.","Univ.

As it is used for both supporting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, and connecting vehicles to external resources including cloud services, Internet, and user devices while improving the road traffic conditions, VANET is a Key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). As such, VANET can be exposed to cyber attacks related to the wireless environment, and those of traditional information technologies systems it is connected to. However, when looking at solutions that have been proposed to address VANET security issues, it emerges that guaranteeing security in VANET essentially amounts to resorting to cryptographic-centric mechanisms. Although the use of public key Infrastructure (PKI) fulfills most VANET' security requirements related to physical properties of the wireless transmissions, simply relying on cryptography does not secure a network. This is the case for vulnerabilities at layers above the MAC layer. Because of their capability to bypass security policy control, they can still expose VANET, and thus, the ITS to cyber attacks. Thereby, one needs security solutions that go beyond cryptographic mechanisms in order cover multiple threat vectors faced by VANET. In this paper focusing on attack detection, we show how using an implementation combining observation of events and incidents from multiple sources at different layers Sybil nodes can be detected regardless of the VANET architecture.","","","","10.1109/SSIC.2015.7245674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7245674","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS);Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) security;attack detection","Communication system security;Cryptography;IP networks;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","intelligent transportation systems;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","IEEE802.11p standard;VANET;attack detection;cryptographic-centric mechanisms;cyber attacks;intelligent transportation systems;mobile ad hoc network;security analytics;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless mobile environment","","0","","","","","5-7 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, insufficiency of memory and battery power of sensors makes sensor networks vulnerable to be attacked. As a second line of defense, intrusion detection system (IDS) is one useful method defending against attacks. In present literatures, most of IDS models in WSN are static IDS (SIDS), which have inherent disadvantages and are not feasible for WSN. This paper proposes a dynamic model of IDS (DIDS) for WSN, which has a remarkable improvement in the security, stability and robustness issues as compared to SIDS. Simulation results show that DIDSpsilas detection rate is 10% higher than SIDS with a range of 15 m and much higher with smaller ranges, and DIDS can prolong the lifetime of networks by 8% on average.","","978-1-4244-2183-1","978-1-4244-2184-8","10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4608028","","Analytical models;Energy efficiency;Event detection;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Monitoring;Protection;Robust stability;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","dynamic model;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor network security","","6","","15","","","20-23 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel IP traceback approach based on packet logging and deterministic packet marking (LDPM) is proposed, that significantly improves IP traceback in several aspects: (1) LDPM is built on a distributed hierarchical IP traceback system, and is simple to deploy. (2) LDPM uses a new IP header encoding scheme to store the complete identification information of a router into a single packet, thus it can protect the privacy of network topology and victims can identify attack ingress router with one packet. It also can cope with large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. (3) LDPM can manipulate the marking information at the edge ingress routers. Therefore, as a value-added services, ISPs can provide traceback business to their customers. Compared with previous traceback schemes, LDPM improves the performance and practicability of IP traceback.","","978-0-7695-3825-9","","10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341555","IP traceback;deterministic packet marking;distributed denial of service;network security;packet logging","Computer crime;Computer networks;Embedded computing;Encoding;IP networks;Information security;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Privacy;Protection","IP networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP header encoding scheme;IP spoofing attack;IP traceback mechanism;attack ingress router;deterministic packet logging;deterministic packet marking;distributed hierarchical IP traceback system;network topology privacy protection;single packet router","","3","","24","","","25-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such applications typically comprise a complex pipeline of processing components that capture, transform and analyze the incoming data stream. In addition, applications must provide high throughput, be scalable and easily modifiable so that new analytical components can be added with minimum effort. In this paper we describe the MeDICi integration framework (MIF), which is a middleware platform we have created to address these challenges. The MIF extends an open source messaging platform with a component-based API for integrating components into analytical pipelines. We describe the features and capabilities of the MIF, and show how it has been used to build a production analytical application for detecting cyber security attacks. The application was composed from multiple independently developed components using several different programming languages. The resulting application was able to process network sensor traffic in real time and provide insightful feedback to network analysts as soon as potential attacks were recognized.","","978-0-7695-3092-5","","10.1109/WICSA.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459148","component model;integration;pipelines","Application software;Computer security;Data analysis;Independent component analysis;Middleware;Performance analysis;Pipelines;Production;Software engineering;Throughput","data analysis;middleware;object-oriented programming;pipeline processing;security of data","API;MeDICi integration framework;cyber security attack detection;high performance data streaming application;middleware;network sensor traffic;open source messaging platform;pipeline processing component;production analytical application;programming language;software engineering problem","","5","","22","","","18-21 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for establishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or pair-wise keys in the network.

Intrusions using security breaches to achieve unauthorized access or misuse of critical information can have catastrophic consequences. To protect computer hosts from the increasing threat of intrusion, various kinds of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been developed. The main disadvantages of current IDSs are a high false detection rate and the lack of post-intrusion decision support capability. To minimize these drawbacks, we propose an event-driven intrusion detection architecture which integrates subject-verb-object (SVO) multi-point monitors and an impact analysis engine. Alert fusion and verification models are implemented to provide more reasonable intrusion information from incomplete, inconsistent or imprecise alerts acquired by SVO monitors.

Bus-based CAN does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus-based CAN are alarming, because safety-critical subsystems (e.g., the power train) often deploy a CAN bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus-based CAN systems. The CAN router establishes a partitioning of a CAN bus into separate CAN segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the CAN system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the CAN router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus-based CAN, but are detected and contained on router-based CAN. The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e.g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the CAN router offers ports that are compatible to standard CAN, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy CAN based systems.","","978-1-4673-2685-8","978-1-4673-2683-4","10.1109/SIES.2012.6356590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356590","","Automotive engineering;Multicast communication;Routing;Security;Software;Topology","computer network security;controller area networks;software maintenance","CAN router;CAN systems security;automotive applications;automotive domain;bus-based CAN;controller area network;denial-of-service attacks;eavesdropping;failure propagation;legacy CAN based systems;message fabrication;power train;router-based CAN;safety domain;safety-critical subsystems;star coupling router;trust model","","2","","24","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naïve bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced. This is used to form new features, based on the features of the original data set.

Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","86","7","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system. The paper presents the Evasion technique for customized apriori algorithm. The paper aims to make a new functional structure to evade NIDS. This framework can be used to audit NIDS. This framework shows that a proof of concept showing how to evade a self-built NIDS considering two publicly available datasets.","","978-1-4799-8083-3","","10.1109/ICIT.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033353","Evasion;Intrusion detection;Network intrusion detection system;Network security","Classification algorithms;Computers;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring","computer crime;computer network security","actual attack categorization;anomalous behavior;customized apriori algorithm;evade network intrusion detection system;evasion technique;hackers;hardware tool;hostile traffic;malicious behavior;modified apriori approach;network packets;network segments;self-built NIDS;software tool;visible attack","","0","","11","","","22-24 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of them scarcely try to combine the two issues together to propose an integrated solution, which is employed to defend the pivotal data and to recover the data when the intrusion has taken place. In this paper, we propose a framework of intrusion detection/recovery system (IDRS). This system is capable of detecting the intrusion on the file-level and recovering data on the block-level. Its advantages include that the file-level detection simplifies the implementation and the recovery based on the block-level can decrease the recovery time and raise the utilization ratio of storage devices. Again, considering that iSCSI has increasingly played an important role in network storage systems, we implement the IDRS prototype based on this promising protocol. The result of tests shows the extra storage overheads, arising from IDRS, are small (less than 10%). Therefore, we believe it is feasible to deploy IRDS on iSCSI systems to protect key files from damage.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529401","","Availability;Data engineering;Data security;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Protection;Protocols","digital storage;file organisation;security of data","IDRS;block-level data recovery;file-level intrusion detection;iSCSI;network storage systems","","1","","16","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is thus faced to not only the IP-networks security issues, but also to new issues which are related to the SIP protocol directly. In this paper, we present the most relevant SIP-related security vulnerabilities and threats; then, we discuss the different security mechanisms that can be deployed to overcome the SIP security issues while putting emphasis the most important ones.

Several researchers are looking at the possibility of the existence of a total three networks: passenger network (PN), crew network (CRN), and the control network (CON). Researchers envision an architecture where these three networks co-exist in an airplane. The available Internet connectivity can be utilized for transporting flight critical information like cockpit flight data recorder (CFDR) data, digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data, cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data and controller pilot data link communication. In addition, the Internet connectivity could also be used for other safety mechanisms like video surveillance and remote control of the flight. Security is one of the major concerns that affect the successful deployment of aircraft data networks (ADN) and other safety features. Several studies have been carried out to secure the network using firewalls and intrusion detection system but so far no study has focused on securing the communication channel (between the aircraft and the ground station) and its impact on the ADN. The scope of this research is to determine the viability and need of a security mechanism.

In this paper we analyzed VoIP architecture, both theoretically and practically with more emphasizes on security of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In order to analyze theoretically, we performed a literature survey related to SIP security and classified it in term of existing SIP attacks and defenses. Our theoretical analysis reveals that most attacks on VoIP architecture were successful due to weaknesses of SIP, especially the authentication mechanism used in the session establishment phase. For practical analysis, we used open source Asterisk and pen-test it in different attacking scenarios using Kali Linux distribution. Our practical analysis studies revealed that open source asterisk server is still vulnerable to several attacks, which includes eavesdropping, intentional interruption, social threats, interception and modification, and unintentional interruption. We also provide a concise mitigating scheme based on Single Sign-On (SSO), which provides an efficient and reliable authentication mechanism for securing SIP.","","978-1-4799-6088-0","","10.1109/ICET.2014.7021022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021022","Asterisk;PSTN;RTP;SIP;Security;VoIP","Authentication;Cryptography;Internet;Interrupters;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;telecommunication security","Kali Linux distribution;PSTN;SIP;VoIP;authentication mechanism;public switch telephone network;security analysis;session initiation protocol;voice over Internet protocol","","1","","33","","","8-9 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have simulated in NS2 environment and shown the comparison of energy consumption or Residual energy of nodes having fixed transmission range with the proposed adaptive energy scheme. Adaptive energy scheme adjusts the range of transmission of each node based on the maximum distance between nodes in each cluster.

For key management and key exchange, Key is generated by the ECC key generator and then Key agreement can be done by Diffie-Hellman. Combining the concept of ECC and DH is called Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange. Authentication should be done by Using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). This provides security protection for outsourced data, while introducing only minimal performance and monetary cost overhead.","","978-1-4799-7318-7","","10.1109/EIC.2015.7230712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7230712","AES (Advanced Encryption Standard);Blowfish Algorithm;Cloud Computing;Digital Signature;ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography);Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH);Modified AES","Authentication;Cloud computing;Elliptic curve cryptography;Encryption;Organizations","cloud computing;data privacy;digital signatures;public key cryptography;storage management;user interfaces","AES;Blowfish;ECC key generator;ECDH key exchange;ECDSA;cloud computing;data storage;elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange;elliptic curve digital signature algorithm;encryption;enhanced hybrid algorithm;maintenance;monetary cost overhead;private cloud security;secured user authentication","","0","","20","","","10-11 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the IEEE International","20051107","2005","","","188","196","Network intrusion detection is becoming an increasingly important tool to protect critical information and infrastructure from unauthorized access. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well. On the other hand, many other common architecture and system optimizations have only a negligible impact on throughput.","","0-7803-9461-5","","10.1109/IISWC.2005.1526016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526016","","Communication system control;Communication system traffic control;Computer science;High-speed networks;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control;Workstations","computer networks;performance evaluation;public domain software;security of data;telecommunication security","full-system simulation;interrupt aggregation;modern workstation architecture;open source network intrusion detection systems;packet loss minimization;rule set pruning;system-level optimization","","2","","22","","","6-8 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile devices logically move by changing addresses throughout the course of their communication in the system. These mobiles nodes acquire characteristics of a moving target defense, in which nodes change addresses to avoid detection and attack. Yet, as mobile nodes change addresses, the critical points in the system that applications are set to communicate with, such as servers, cloud services, and peer registration servers, remain static and become easily identifiable. Mobile-enabled systems are beginning to model heterogeneous moving target networks, in which some nodes move while others remain static. Heterogeneous moving target networks expose relationships and dependencies between nodes, helping an attacker easily identify the static, critical nodes within a mobile-enabled system. Homogeneous moving target networks, in which all nodes change addresses, mask the critical points within the system, blending the mobile nodes with the critical, static nodes, and provide additional security for the static nodes. By applying a moving target defense to all nodes within a mobile-enabled system, the critical points can be masked and additional security can be provided.","","","","10.1109/MOBS.2013.6614222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614222","Information security;Mobile Networks;Moving Target Defense","Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Servers","computer network security;mobile computing;radio networks","attack avoidance;attack detection;cloud services;critical nodes;heterogeneous moving target networks;mobile applications;mobile computing;mobile devices;mobile node instability;mobile-enabled systems;network communication characteristics;network-layer moving target defense;peer registration servers;static node security;static nodes","","0","","11","","","25-25 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Medium or large enterprises usually have heterogeneous computing environments. For example, a company may use an Apache server in a Linux-base PC as its Internet Web server, use an IBM AIX running IBM DB2 database system as a database server, and equip all employees with Windows-based PCs running Microsoft Office for their daily work. Also, employees might work at many different locations. In the enterprise patch management (PM) market today, there are very few complete off-the-shelf solutions. A systematic efficient PM process model with complete patch management activity process cycle and patching strategies was proposed. We also propose an automatic five-layer PM system application architecture supporting heterogeneous environment.

However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","","","","1","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"
