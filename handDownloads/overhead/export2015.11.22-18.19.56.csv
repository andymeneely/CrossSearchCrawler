However, the manager becomes a bottleneck for being connected by each client. It can even overload when too many clients request service simultaneously. The whole system may collapse when the central manager is attacked. And these systems are passive to detect and deal with the secure problem. We present a mobile agent-based P2P model for autonomous security hole discovery (MASHD). It can detect infection and network intrusion based on knowledge of the local host. Viruses are removed and connections are refused after identification. In case of a suspicious activity, MASHD initiates a voting approach to make a collective decision and take further action. The integration of peer-to-peer behavior with mobile agents reduces latency and load; however, flexibility, effectivity, security and cooperation of the system are enhanced.","","0-7695-2432-X","","10.1109/CIT.2005.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1562741","","Computer science;Computer security;Computer viruses;Engineering management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Voting","authorisation;computer viruses;mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing","autonomous security hole discovery;computer viruses;mobile agent;network intrusion;peer-to-peer computing;security system","","1","","7","","","21-23 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It's a serious subject to protect this information against intruders. However, conventional security mechanisms haven't been designed to detect anomalous actions of database users. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed model in the term of error equal rate.","","978-1-4799-0078-7","","10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707175","Anomaly detection;Database intrusion detection;Database security;Role-based profiling","Data structures;Database systems;Fingerprint recognition;Intrusion detection;Vectors","Bayes methods;SQL;authorisation;pattern classification;query processing","IDS;NBC;RBAC database system;anomaly detection approach;compact data structure;error equal rate;hexplet;intrusion detection systems;naive Bayes classifier;normal database access behavior;raw transactional SQL queries;role administrated database;role-based access control database system;transaction-based approach;transaction-log entry;valuable information resources","","0","","20","","","26-28 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we propose to use the piloting plane concept to grant autonomicity in current networks. This plane aims at optimizing existing applications by using elaborate algorithms fed by pertinent knowledge recovered from the knowledge plane. In our approach, we demonstrate that the knowledge and the piloting planes are complementary and both are required when implementing autonomic solutions. We illustrate our proposal by applying these concepts on the handover selection phase which is a key issue in the handover process for granting global mobility to users in heterogeneous environment. We also describe a first implementation of our handover piloting system.

Deliberate and intended actions such as malicious exploitation, theft or destruction of data, are not only harmful and difficult to detect, but frequently these threats are propagated by an insider. Unfortunately, current efforts to identify unauthorized access to information such as what is found in document control and management systems are limited in scope and capabilities. This paper presents an approach to detecting anomalies in business transactions and processes using a graph representation. In our graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) approach, anomalous instances of structural patterns are discovered in data that represent entities, relationships and actions. A definition of graph-based anomalies and a brief description of the GBAD algorithms are presented, followed by empirical results using a discrete-event simulation of real-world business transactions and processes.","","978-1-4244-2765-9","","10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4938645","","Communication system security;Companies;Computer science;Control systems;Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Pattern matching;Protection;Terrorism","authorisation;business data processing;data mining;graph theory;transaction processing","GBAD algorithm;business transaction process;data mining;graph-based anomaly detection;malicious exploitation;securing sensitive information;unauthorized access","","1","","18","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To render networks more secure, intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) aim to recognize attacks within constraints of two major performance considerations: high detection and low false-alarm rates. It is also not enough to detect already-known intrusions, yet-unseen attacks or variations of those known present a real challenge in the design of these systems. IDSs are firmly entrenched on the security front but the exact role they can play and what their deployment entails must be clear to planners of security. Nine artificial neural networks (ANN) based IDS were implemented and tested with three experiments with three topologies.

Authorized but malicious transactions can make a database useless by impairing its integrity and availability. The paper presents the design of a real-time data attack isolation system, denoted DAIS. DAIS isolates likely suspicious actions before a definite determination of intrusion is reported. In this way, the database can be immunized from many malicious transactions. DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991538","","Data security;Database systems;Face detection;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems;Transaction databases","SQL;authorisation;data integrity;database management systems;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;transaction processing","COTS-DBMS-specific implementation;DAIS;Informix;Microsoft SQL Server;Oracle;Oracle Server;Sybase;authorized malicious transactions;commercial database applications;data attacks;database application platforms;database security mechanisms;end user transparency;first DAIS prototype;general isolation algorithm;integrity;intrusion tolerance;likely suspicious actions;malicious transactions;real-time data attack isolation system;transaction profiles;user SQL statements","","3","","33","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples include buffer overflow attacks, flooding attacks, system break-ins, etc. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a key role in detecting such malicious activities and enable administrators in securing network systems. Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses. Various design choices that were made to make this system practical and difficulties faced in integrating with existing models are also described.

While obtaining high performance, it remains extremely flexible, with packet processing tasks implemented as simple modular elements that are composed to build fully functional routers and switches. Snap is based on the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural features that support batched packet processing, memory structures optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with in-order completion. We show that Snap can run complex pipelines at high speeds on commodity PC hardware by building an IP router incorporating both an IDS-like full-packet string matcher and an SDN-like packet classifier. In this configuration, Snap is able to forward 40 million packets per second, saturating four 10 Gbps NICs at packet sizes as small as 128 byes. This represents an increase in throughput of nearly 4x over the baseline Click running comparable elements on the CPU.","","978-1-4799-1640-5","","10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6665173","","Graphics processing units;IP networks;Kernel;Parallel processing;Pipelines;Ports (Computers);Throughput","","","","4","","28","","","21-22 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This scheme extracts a small quantity of samples to run the test, instead of regulating the total times of test in advance. It decides whether continue the test or not based on the test result until it obtains the final conclusion.

To achieve IMPC, a novel multi-pattern matching algorithm, called ACS, is proposed, which is based on CDFA. Compared to the algorithms on DFA, our method can reduce 78.6% states for Snort pattern set, which results in one of the most memory efficient methods. The most important is that our method is a kind of optimization and can be embedded to other algorithms as the second step for better results. Finally the architecture based on ACS is proposed and the experimental results show that 47.6% to 84.0% memory space can be saved for different size of pattern sets as compared to the best known architectures. The method is another one based on CDFA.

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","1-4244-0357-X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932","","Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;invasive software","Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system","","0","","11","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are becoming ubiquitous and have been widely used to transfer critical information, such as banking accounts, credit cards, e-mails, and social network credentials. The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes a design and implementation of parallel firewall architecture that is able to handle packets for high-speed network. The implementation utilizes arrays of Linux-based firewall under data parallel scheme running incorporate with specific ASIC switch. The load balancing mechanism, using hashing of disjoint subset, distributes the traffic among a configurable number of parallel machines, providing high performance with reliability, flexibility, and scalability.

These processor systems are vulnerable to attacks that can be launched entirely through the data plane of the network without any access to the control interface of the router. Prior work has shown that a single malformed UDP packet can take over a network processor running vulnerable packet processing software and trigger a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network. One possible defense mechanism for these resource-constrained network processors is the use of hardware monitoring systems that track the operations of each processor core. Any deviation from programmed behavior indicates an attack and triggers reset and recovery actions. Such hardware monitors have been studied extensively for single processor cores, but network processors consist of dozens to hundreds of processors with highly dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present the design of a Scalable Hardware Monitoring Grid, which allows the dynamic sharing of hardware monitoring resources among processor cores.

That could block or at least relevantly slow down IMS acceptance by network operators and application providers. To address these challenges, this paper thoroughly analyzes IMS scalability with special attention to intradomain deployment issues. Then, it proposes a novel solution with three core original contributions toward intradomain scalability: 1) data-centric dissemination of session state with limited overhead; 2) service-aware routing for fast intradomain load balancing; 3) service-aware load monitoring and component de-/activation for long-term intradomain load partitioning at both service and infrastructure levels.

An important component of any strong security solution is represented by intrusion detection (ID) systems, able to detect anomalous behavior by applications and users. To date, however, there have been very few ID mechanisms specifically tailored to database systems. In this paper, we propose such a mechanism. The approach we propose to ID is based on mining database traces stored in log files. The result of the mining process is used to form user profiles that can model normal behavior and identify intruders. An additional feature of our approach is that we couple our mechanism with role based access control (RBAC). Under a RBAC system permissions are associated with roles, usually grouping several users, rather than with single users. Our ID system is able to determine role intruders, that is, individuals that while holding a specific role, have a behavior different from the normal behavior of the role. An important advantage of providing an ID mechanism specifically tailored to databases is that it can also be used to protect against insider threats. Furthermore, the use of roles makes our approach usable even for databases with large user population.

In this paper, we propose a new NSG system-PolyTree, to defend against polymorphic worms. We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493","Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation","","digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures","NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering","","7","","36","","2010-06-17","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a hybrid IDS, which combines network and host IDS, with anomaly and misuse detection mode, utilizes auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and applies data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities.","","978-1-4244-6388-6","978-1-4244-6389-3","10.1109/ETCS.2010.478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459845","analysis engine;apriori algorithm;data mining;hybrid ids;intrusion detection","Computer hacking;Computer science;Content addressable storage;Data mining;Data security;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Engines;Intrusion detection;System testing","data mining;feature extraction;security of data;uncertainty handling","auditing programs;data mining;feature extract;host IDS;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;misuse detection mode;network connection;network-based intrusion detection techniques;security infrastructures;uncertainty characteristic","","4","","5","","","6-7 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IDS for MANETs have attracted much attention recently and thus, there are many publications that propose new IDS solutions or improvements to the existing. In this paper, we study the different architectures existing the IDS for MANETs. We briefly present for each architecture, after an analysis, the strengths and weaknesses, the methods/techniques that have been proposed to improve the performances and the provided security services. Then, we propose a new IDS architecture for MANET, this architecture is a combination of model hierarchical based on clusters and cooperation model based on a multi-agent system (SMA).

In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too. On the other hand, even though Snort-Wireless is an infrastructure independent detector, it cannot adapt to unknown attacks even if they are similar to others for which it has signatures on.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529352","Denial of Service;Genetic Programming;Intrusion Detection System;Wireless Networks","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;Detectors;Floods;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;wireless LAN","GP based IDS;Kismet;Snort-Wireless;WiFi networks;data link layer;genetic programming;intrusion detection system;machine learning;wireless networks","","0","","17","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a solution which addresses these core security requirements. In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key distribution to allow scalable data sharing. Our scheme uses strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities (e.g., switches, routers or other network elements), thereby removing bottlenecks at the disks and causing minimal inconvenience to the hosts. By recognizing the peer nature of the group of SAN entities, we propose efficient group key mechanisms that do not involve any centralized key distribution servers.

By exploiting such vulnerabilities, we propose attack methods for revealing a victim program's data kept in GPU memory both during its execution and right after its termination. We further show the high applicability of the proposed attacks by applying them to the Chromium and Firefox web browsers which use GPUs for accelerating webpage rendering. We detect that both browsers leave rendered webpage textures in GPU memory, so that we can infer which web pages a victim user has visited by analyzing the remaining textures.

Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 14th International Conference on","20051031","2005","","","275","280","Attack mitigation schemes actively throttle attack traffic generated in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This paper presents attack diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking. AD's architecture is inline with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm, in which attack detection is performed near the victim host and attack mitigation is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense that is activated by a victim host after an attack has been detected. A victim activates AD by sending AD-related commands to its upstream routers. On receipt of such commands, the AD-enabled upstream routers deterministically mark each packet destined for the victim with the information of the input interface that processed that packet. By collecting the router interface information recorded in the packet markings, the victim can trace back the attack traffic to the attack sources. Once the traceback is complete, the victim issues messages that command AD-enabled routers to filter attack packets close to the source. The AD commands can be authenticated by the TTL field of the IP header without relying on any global key distribution infrastructure in Internet. Although AD can effectively filter traffic generated by a moderate number of attack sources, it is not effective against large-scale attacks. To address this problem, we propose an extension to AD called parallel attack diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attack sources simultaneously. AD and PAD are analyzed and evaluated using a realistic network topology based on the Skitter Internet map. Both schemes are shown to be robust against IP spoofing and incur low false positive ratios.","1095-2055","0-7803-9428-3","","10.1109/ICCCN.2005.1523866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1523866","","Atherosclerosis;Computer crime;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","DDoS attack;IP header;Internet protocol;PAD;Skitter Internet map;TTL field;attack diagnosis;attack mitigation scheme;counter-measure paradigm;distributed denial-of-service;global key distribution infrastructure;packet marking;parallel attack diagnosis;pushback marking;realistic network topology;transistor-transistor logic","","3","","17","","","17-19 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Self-secure Routing Protocol for Large Mobile Ad hoc Networks","Nguyen Van Vinh; Heesung Jun; Myung-Kyun Kim","Ulsan Univ., Ulsan","Wireless and Optical Communications Networks, 2007. WOCN '07. IFIP International Conference on","20070808","2007","","","1","5","Securing mobile ad hoc networks is a nowadays emerging research topic. In this paper, we propose a self-secure routing protocol that is primarily based on public-key certificates which are provided locally and flexibly. Specifically, by taking self-securing approach, the proposed protocol makes use of a localized trust model which allows users to get certificates and to perform authentication without requirement of any on-line trusted third party. Compared to other securing routing protocols, our solution eliminates the unrealistic assumption about the availability of on-line trusted authorities or certificate repositories, thus, it can take advantage of public-key technology to prevent many types of attack from malicious nodes. Moreover, in the public-key distribution scheme, a solution for reducing overhead is proposed that makes our protocol adaptable to large mobile ad hoc networks.","","1-4244-1005-3","1-4244-1005-3","10.1109/WOCN.2007.4284230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284230","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Batteries;Certification;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Public key;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;public key cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication security","large mobile ad hoc networks;localized trust model;malicious nodes;public-key certificates;public-key distribution scheme;self-secure routing protocol","","2","","10","","","2-4 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multiplexed bus is needed for HIPS (Host-based Intrusion Prevention System) in 4G mobile communications. Because an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) has been used for the multiplexed bus, there is a problem where it doesn't work at over 1 GHz. Then, the use of the FPGA leads to increase in power consumption. In this work, by using 180 nm C-MOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) technology, waved-shift registers necessary for the multiplexed bus are developed. Furthermore, the comparative evaluations of the waved-shift registers are executed by using the conventional shift register that operates at 2GHz. As a result, the waved-shift registers are revealed to have surpassed all the points of throughput, power consumption and area.","","","","10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6925898","4G mobile communications;C-MOS;multiplexed bus;network security;shift register;wave-pipeline","Application specific integrated circuits;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Lead;Mobile communication;Modems;Registers","4G mobile communication;CMOS integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;multiplexing;shift registers;telecommunication security","180 nm CMOS technology;4G mobile communications;FPGA;HIPS;complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology;field-programmable gate array;frequency 1 GHz;frequency 2 GHz;host-based intrusion prevention system;multiplexed bus;waved-shift register evaluation","","1","","9","","","19-21 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key idea of SCOLD is to follow the intrusion tolerance paradigm and provide alternate routes via a set of proxy servers and alternate gateways when the normal route is unavailable or unstable due to network failures, congestion, or DDoS attacks. The BIND9 DNS server and its DNS update utilities are enhanced to support new DNS entries with indirect routing information. Protocol software for supporting the establishment of indirect routes based on the new DNS entries is developed for Linux systems. Experimental results show that SCOLD can improve the network security, availability and performance. Preliminary simulation results using NS2 indicate that the performance is scalable with respect to the indirect route initial setup overhead and processing overhead.","","0-7803-8794-5","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2004.1378408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378408","","Computer crime;Computer science;IP networks;Internet;Network servers;Protocols;Routing;Springs;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;Linux;computer network management;computer network reliability;network servers;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","BIND9 DNS server;DDoS attacks;DNS update utilities;Internet;Linux systems;NS2;SCOLD system;alternate gateways;alternate routes;distributed denial of service;indirect routes;initial setup overhead;intrusion tolerance;network availability;network performance;network security;processing overhead;protocol software;proxy servers;secure collective defense system","","2","","20","","","29 Nov.-3 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we advocate the use of a hybrid approach, in which each type of cache acts as a module in a system with shared memory and storage space. A static scheduler precedes the cache modules and determines what types of traffic should be forwarded to which module. We also propose several optimizations for each of the modules, such that the storage and memory overhead are minimized. We evaluate the proposed system by performing a trace driven emulation. Our results indicate that a hybrid system is able to provide better savings than a proxy cache, or a standalone RE system. The hybrid system requires less memory, less disk space and provides a speed-up ratio equal to three compared to an RE system.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363843","Hybrid Cache;Redundancy Elimination;Traffic deduplication;WAN optimization","Bandwidth;Encoding;Memory management;Optimization;Redundancy;Servers;Streaming media","Internet;shared memory systems;wide area networks","WAN links;Web optimization;cache modules;chunk level deduplication;hybrid approach;object level deduplication;proxy caches;redundancy elimination systems;redundant bytes removal;shared memory;standalone RE system;static scheduler;storage space;trace driven emulation","","4","","16","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The distributed architecture and broadcast transmission characteristics mean they are vulnerable and provide little resistance to intrusive and non-intrusive attack mechanisms. Incorporating data security using traditional approaches introduces significant latency which can be problematic in the presence of real-time deadlines. We demonstrate how a security layer can be added within the network communication controller in modern time-triggered systems, without introducing additional latency or processing overheads. This allows critical communications to be secured in a manner that is transparent to the processors in the electronic control units (ECUs), while also safeguarding network communication properties.","","978-1-4799-6244-0","","10.1109/FPT.2014.7082788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7082788","","Automotive engineering;Encryption;Field programmable gate arrays;Protocols;Synchronization;Vehicles","automotive electronics;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays","FPGAs;electronic control units;network communication controller;time-triggered automotive networks;zero latency encryption","","1","","22","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, existing technologies are insufficient as primitives for end-host security. For example, Berkeley packet filter (BPF), the most popular monitoring infrastructure for many Unix systems, is intended for packet capturing at physical interfaces, and thus, not appropriate for monitoring of applications, which is sometimes critical for system security. This paper presents a simple solution to the problem, utilizing hierarchical virtual network interface (VIF) mechanism. VIF is a new OS abstraction that can be hierarchically structured and attached to OS entities to control their network I/O. We extend VIFs to allow filtering and monitoring of their traffic, and show that it has desirable properties for end-host monitoring and control of traffic. We present our prototype implementation on FreeBSD, and evaluate it qualitatively and quantitatively. Demonstrated advantages include: i) ability to monitor terminating entities at arbitrary granularity, ii) a single consistent framework for both network security and network quality of service, iii) OS independence, iv) efficiency as a control primitive, v) compatibility with BPF interface and its applications, and vi) flexibility for future functional expansion.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498485","","Application software;Band pass filters;Communication system traffic control;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Inspection;Intelligent networks;Peace technology;Quality of service;Traffic control","computer networks;information filters;network interfaces;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Berkeley packet filter;Netnice packet filter;QoS;Unix systems;end-host network control;network quality of service;system security;telecommunication traffic;virtual network interface mechanism","","0","","35","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users with power credentials can do almost anything they want with the systems they own with very little control or oversight.

Developing a solution for such a problem is challenging because power users need flexible requirements to administer or maintain their systems. The increased usage of virtual environments, virtual systems, teleworking, and remote usage has made network access the preferred method for system administration. This paper presents (1) the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS), a framework that provides a solution to this problem and meet the above mentioned challenges, and (2) a proof-of-concept prototype that embeds self-protection capabilities into traditional Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS). AVPS focuses on self-protection against security policy violations instead of malware, vulnerability, or exploit intrusions.

Collaboration between mobile nodes is more significant in MANETs, which have as their greatest challenges vulnerabilities to various security attacks and an inability to operate securely while preserving its resources and performing secure routing among nodes. Therefore, it is essential to develop an effective secure routing protocol to protect the nodes from anonymous behaviors. Currently, game theory is a tool that analyzes, formulates and solves selfishness issues. It is seldom applied to detect malicious behavior in networks. It deals, instead, with the strategic and rational behavior of each node. In our study, we used the dynamic Bayesian signaling game to analyze the strategy profile for regular and malicious nodes. This game also revealed the best actions of individual strategies for each node. Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) provides a prominent solution for signaling games to solve incomplete information by combining strategies and payoff of players that constitute equilibrium. Using PBE strategies of nodes are private information of regular and malicious nodes. Regular nodes should be cooperative during routing and update their payoff, while malicious nodes take sophisticated risks by evaluating their risk of being identified to decide when to decline. This approach minimizes the utility of malicious nodes and it motivates better cooperation between nodes by using the reputation system. Regular nodes monitor continuously to evaluate their neighbors using belief updating systems of the Bayes rule.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2015.000012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059537","Bayes rule;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE);secure routing;strategy","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Game theory;Games;Mobile computing;Receivers;Routing protocols","Bayes methods;cryptographic protocols;game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","MANETs;PBE strategy;anonymous behaviors;belief updating systems;dynamic Bayesian signaling game;game theory model;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;perfect Bayesian equilibrium;regular nodes;reputation system;secure routing protocol;security attacks","","0","","","","","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.","1060-9857","978-1-4577-1349-1","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076761","card data flow;compliance;payment system;private cloud;virtual machine","Credit cards;Decision support systems;Kernel;Security;Sockets;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","PCI DSS compliance;card transaction processing;credit card data flow automated discovery;credit card process;intrusive instrumentation;middleware;payment card industry;payment infrastructure;personal financial transactions;private cloud environments;security compliance;source code application;virtual machine introspection technology;virtual machines;virtualized servers","","3","","29","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we review current wireless intrusion detection systems and evaluate their performance to detect a wide range of wireless network attacks. To evaluate the performance of WIDSs, we use several performance metrics to quantify the accuracy, extendibility, adaptability, scalability, overhead, and latency of the examined WIDSs.

They are being increasingly deployed by the corporate and academic sector organizations. The wide deployment and use of WLANs has made it imperative for service providers to provide secure access to network for valid users and able to suitably detect, identify and terminate the access for invalid users. While most of the wired network cabling is located inside buildings, already secured from the use of un-authorized physical access through the use of keys, badge access and so forth. In contrast, wireless APs may be accessed from the premises or even slightly away from premises where they are deployed, if the signal is detectable (for instance, from parking lots or nearby buildings). Thus wireless networks require a very secure access to APs and the ability to isolate and terminate any potential threat to the network. To achieve the same, a system, named as INDICT (Intruder Detection, Identification, Containment and Termination) is presented, which is built on a novel idea aimed at providing secure wireless access to legitimate users.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276573","","Business;Communication system security;Computer crime;Computer science;Educational institutions;Signal detection;Signal processing;Viruses (medical);Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","authorisation;signal detection;subscriber loops;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","INDICT system;academic sector organization;access layer;access termination;badge access;corporate sector organization;intruder detection;intruder identification;service provider;signal detection;unauthorized physical access;wired network cabling;wireless LAN","","0","","9","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In Part I, the emphasis is on the design of an electrical control architecture for an offshore oil drilling platform powered by wind generation. Engineering a distributed control system having safety critical features, requiring real-time performance is challenging. In this follow-up article we introduce the communication framework for the microgrid scenario under investigation. In all communication networks, scholastic delays and performance are inherent. The only feasible approach is to put bounds on the random processes, qualitatively define the worst cases, and build the distributed control system to be resilient enough to tolerate those behaviors. This is the approach taken by this paper. We propose a communication architecture, discuss performances requirements of the sub-systems, and layout network solutions meeting those specifications.","","","","10.1109/TDC.2014.6863567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863567","Communication Network Performance and Availability;DC Microgrids;Distributed Control Architecture;Security","","","","","2","","15","","","14-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters. These optimum static polling rates introduce minimum and maximum thresholds for the various scenarios mobile devices encounter on a daily basis.

The hardware of host-based IDS has been designed by using wave-pipeline technique and implemented by using reconfigurable hardware, FPGA (field programmable gate array).

IEEE","20070723","2007","","","1","8","In the power industry, the focus has been almost exclusively on implementing equipment that can keep the power system reliable. Until recently, communications and information flows have been considered of peripheral importance. However, increasingly the information infrastructure that supports the monitoring and control of the power system has come to be critical to the reliability of the power system. Communication protocols are one of the most critical parts of power system operations, responsible for retrieving information from field equipment and, vice versa, for sending control commands. Despite their key function, to-date these communication protocols have rarely incorporated any security measures, including security against inadvertent errors, power system equipment malfunctions, communications equipment failures, or deliberate sabotage. Since these protocols were very specialized, ""security by obscurity"" has been the primary approach. However, security by obscurity is no longer a valid concept. In particular, the electricity market is pressuring market participants to gain any edge they can. A tiny amount of information can turn a losing bid into a winning bid - or withholding that information from your competitor can make their winning bid into a losing bid. And the desire to disrupt power system operations can stem from careless mistakes, to simple teenager bravado, to competitive game-playing in the electrical marketplace, and even to actual terrorism. As the power industry relies increasingly on information to operate the power system, two infrastructures must now be managed: not only the power system infrastructure, but also the information infrastructure. The management of the power system infrastructure has become reliant on the information infrastructure as automation continues to replace manual operations, as market forces demand more accurate and timely information, and as the power system equipment ages. Therefore, the reliability of the power sys- - tem is increasingly affected by any problems that the information infrastructure might suffer. This paper focuses on IEC TC57 WG15 security standards work which is addressing the reliability and security of the information infrastructure.","1932-5517","1-4244-1296-X","1-4244-1298-6","10.1109/PES.2007.386013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4275779","DNP;ICCP;IEC;IEC 60870-5;IEC 61850;Security;communications;information infrastructure;power system operations;reliability","Communication system security;Energy management;Information security;Power system control;Power system management;Power system measurements;Power system reliability;Power system security;Power systems;Protocols","power markets;power system control;power system economics;power system management;power system reliability;power system security","IEC TC57 WG15 security standards;communication protocols;electricity market;information infrastructure security;power industry;power system control;power system equipment malfunctions;power system management;power system monitoring;power system reliability;reliability enhancement","","18","","","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With recent advances in the performance and viability of using GPUs for various highly-parallelised data processing tasks, a number of security challenges are raised. Unscrupulous software running subsequently on the same GPU, either by the same user, or another user, in a multi-user system, may be able to gain access to the contents of the GPU memory. This contains data from previous program executions. In certain use-cases, where the GPU is used to offload intensive parallel processing such as pattern matching for an intrusion detection system, financial systems, or cryptographic algorithms, it may be possible for the GPU memory to contain privileged data, which would ordinarily be inaccessible to an unprivileged application running on the host computer. With GPUs potentially yielding access to confidential information, existing research in the field is built upon, to investigate the practicality of extracting data from global, shared and texture memory, and retrieving this data for further analysis. These techniques are also implemented on various GPUs using three different Nvidia CUDA versions. A novel methodology for digital forensic examination of GPU memory for remanent data is then proposed, along with some suggestions and considerations towards countermeasures and anti-forensic techniques.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140493","","Digital forensics;Graphics processing units;Memory management;Random access memory;Remanence","digital forensics;graphics processing units;memory architecture;parallel architectures;pattern matching","CUDA graphics processing units;GPU memory;Nvidia CUDA GPU;antiforensic techniques;confidential information access;cryptographic algorithms;data remanence;data retrieval;digital forensic;financial systems;global-shared texture memory;highly-parallelised data processing tasks;host computer;intrusion detection system;memory attacks;multiuser system;offload intensive parallel processing;pattern matching;privileged data;program executions;unprivileged application","","0","","24","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Protected servers are hidden inside a secure overlay network only accessible through a set of access-nodes (AN) with rate limiting and access control functionalities. Protected servers are required to provide at least one dummy public server as an initial connection step point. An experimental prototype is implemented and tested. Results show; system compatibility with e-commerce websites needs, also, the AN impact on the protected server performance is less than 10% reduction in file transfer throughput, in addition, the public server could survive attack rates more than 10 times higher than an ordinary server. Through discussion we demonstrate the system ability to protect the servers' resources from all attack types without sacrificing data integrity or confidentiality.
