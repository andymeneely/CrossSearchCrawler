MANETs are used in various fields like military, industry and emergency recovery. So it is important to have a firsthand knowledge about MANETs. But there is a certain drawback in MANETs, that it becomes prone to malicious attacks very fast. To avoid such attacks a good intrusion detection and prevention system is needed.

Security is an essential requirement for the protocol/standard to be public accepted. One major security issue of RPL is the non-tamper resistant nature of the wireless sensor device, which can make it easy to be compromised and leads to cryptography keys exposed. If this happens, the attackers can join the network as the internal legitimate users and can manipulate the network operation based on controlling the compromised nodes. These internal attackers can make severe consequences to the network performance. In this paper, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of different types of such attacks on RPL. We consider several new internal threats towards RPL, namely Rank attack, Local Repair attack, Neighbour attack and DIS attack. Specifically we study how the network performance can be affected by those attacks through metrics such as end-to-end delay, delivery ratio and control overhead generated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies the vulnerability and the performance of RPL under these internal security threats.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755045","","Accuracy;Communication system security;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;cryptography;personal area networks;routing protocols;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN standard;DIS attack;Internet;control overhead;cryptography keys;delivery ratio;end-to-end delay;internal security threats;local repair attack;lossy network performance;low power network;neighbour attack;rank attack;routing protocol;wireless sensor network","","0","","7","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Is this information necessary for the application to execute or is it gathered for malicious intent?

To overcome this bottleneck, today's network processors can utilize a wide-range of mechanisms - such as multi-level memory hierarchy, wide-word accesses, special-purpose result-caches, asynchronous memory, and hardware multi-threading. However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.","","978-1-59593-082-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260","data-caches;multithreading;network processors","Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput","internetworking;multi-threading","asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses","","6","3","42","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, virtualization also makes it a target for potent rootkits because of the loss of control problem over the hosted Virtual Machines (VMs). This makes traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operating system kernel trustworthiness, no longer an effective solution to secure the virtual infrastructure of the IaaS model. In this paper, we explore briefly the security problem of the IaaS cloud computing model, and present CloudSec, a new virtualization-aware monitoring appliance that provides active, transparent and real-time security monitoring for hosted VMs in the IaaS model. CloudSec utilizes virtual machine introspection techniques to provide fine-grained inspection of VM's physical memory without installing any monitoring code inside the VM. It actively reconstructs and monitors the dynamically changing kernel data structures instances, as a prior step to enable providing protection for kernel data structures. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype using VMsafe libraries on a VMware ESX platform.

But intrusions and misuses have always threatened the secured data communication over networks. Consequently, network security has come into issue. Now-a-days intrusion detection systems play an important role in security infrastructures. Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. The host based systems as well as the network based systems have their own limitations. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present NIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces some significant problems contained by the previous systems such as trust issues and message spreading problems. In the proposed IDS we donpsilat need to install the system for every host. That reduces the system overhead to a reasonable extent. This system generates steady responses against intrusions and stops the intruder to proceed for further attacks.","","978-0-7695-3653-8","","10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5169326","Discard Packet;Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion Prevention;Packet Behavior;Trust Issue","Centralized control;Communication system security;Computer science;Control systems;Data communication;Data security;Global communication;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Springs","computer networks;data communication;security of data;telecommunication security","IDS;NIDS;computer network;global communication;host based system;intrusion prevention;malicious attack;message spreading problem;network based intrusion detection system;network based system;network security;secured data communication;security infrastructure;system overhead;trust issue","","0","","10","","","17-20 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to unique characteristics, such as dynamic network topology, limited bandwidth, and limited battery power, routing in a MANET is a particularly challenging task compared to a conventional network. Early work in MANET research has mainly focused on developing an efficient routing mechanism in such a highly dynamic and resource-constrained network. At present, several efficient routing protocols have been proposed for MANET. Most of these protocols assume a trusted and cooperative environment. However, in the presence of malicious nodes, the networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. In MANET, routing attacks are particularly serious. In this article, we investigate the state-of-the-art of security issues in MANET. In particular, we examine routing attacks, such as link spoofing and colluding misrelay attacks, as well as countermeasures against such attacks in existing MANET protocols.","1536-1284","","","10.1109/MWC.2007.4396947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4396947","","Bandwidth;Batteries;Costs;Intelligent networks;Military communication;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Vehicles;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET protocols;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;routing attacks;routing protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","","97","","23","","","October 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule. Through the careful co-design and optimization of our architecture with a new string matching algorithm we show that it is possible to build a system that is 10 times more efficient than the currently best known approaches.","1063-6897","0-7695-2270-X","","10.1109/ISCA.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431550","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Databases;Heart;Intrusion detection;Network-on-a-chip;Protection;Throughput","computer architecture;optimisation;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","network chips;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;network security;network speed;string matching architecture;wireless device","","16","30","31","","","4-8 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless image sensor networks, some monitoring quality loss may be tolerated since visual information retrieved from source nodes may have different relevance for the application, according to the desired monitoring tasks and the current sensors' poses and fields of view. Based on such sensing relevancies, we propose an energy-efficient visual monitoring mechanism where the frequency of image snapshots transmitted by each source node will be a function of the monitoring relevance of the node for the application. Doing so, we achieve energy saving over the active paths as lower relevant source nodes will transmit fewer images in a period of time, but with low impact to the monitoring functions of the application since sufficient information is still received from the most relevant source nodes.

Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.","","978-1-4244-4422-9","978-1-4244-4421-2","10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307","","Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics)","Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game","","21","2","28","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504","Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security","Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip","firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests","","0","","28","","2015-06-23","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731","Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine","Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput","deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching","ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching","","1","","30","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead. On a 1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine with gigabit Ethernet interfaces, the throughput of the CTCP router is 420.3 Mbits/sec, whereas the throughput of a generic Linux router on the same hardware is only 409.1 Mbits/sec.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377240","","Computer crime;Fingerprint recognition;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;RAKE receivers;Sockets;TCPIP;Throughput","Internet;Linux;open systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine;CTCP router prototype;Internet;Linux kernel;OS fingerprinting;gigabit Ethernet interface;network security;transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture","","2","","39","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a mobile backbone network of trusted nodes is proposed to enhance AODV security with minimum overhead. The proposed backbone network does not violate the MANET mobility characteristic. It is constructed from randomly moving regular MANET nodes based on their trust value, location, and power. The backbone network monitors regular nodes as well as each other to periodically estimate monitoring trust values which represent the reliability of each node in the network.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011","0-7695-2574-1","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","21","2","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system.

In the last few years a number of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed as network security tools. While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching, header processing and detecting DoS attacks at network level. In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks. The proposed DIDS has host IDS component at each host that combines the above-mentioned functionalities. DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost. The nature of future attacks to the Internet's infrastructure is difficult to predict, and partial reconfigurability feature of FPGA will allow the system to be adapted to a constant change allowing the system to adapt to new threats.","","1-4244-0910-1","1-4244-0910-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228344","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Software systems","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","DoS attacks detection;FPGA;Internet;computer networks;distributed intrusion detection systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware accelerators;header processing;reconfigurable hardware;string matching","","2","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to perform this detailed analysis we need to collect the traffic from the suspicious candidate. We decide to use a hardware based system which is going to collect the traffic directly from the suspicious candidate. The traffic collected will be useful as a proof of the infection of the system.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011","0-7695-2339-0","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","7","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One promising strategy is to organize cooperative intrusion detection activities as a multiple-level intrusion detection (ID) hierarchy in which each node reports intrusion detection observations to its parent. This enables detection decisions to be based on aggregated data that has been gathered and consolidated from neighborhoods and larger network regions efficiently. A key challenge is the selection and maintenance of a scalable and robust hierarchy that optimizes detection performance (e.g., low latency, continuous coverage) while incurring minimal cost (e.g., bandwidth consumption). Existing approaches to constructing hierarchies in MANETs based on simple heuristics lack flexibility and cannot simultaneously address diverse performance and cost requirements. Moreover, mobility can produce constant large scale changes in the hierarchy that can degrade performance and increase cost. The main contributions of this paper are to: (a) identify ID structure design requirements and formulate them as objective functions and constraints, (b) adapt a multi-objective optimization framework to the formation of ID structures and, (c) provide indicative results concerning the quality of these structures with respect to the ID design requirements.","","978-1-4244-2676-8","978-1-4244-2677-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753175","","Bandwidth;Cost function;Degradation;Delay;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing protocols;Stochastic processes","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","ID structure design requirements;MANET;intrusion detection data fusion structures;multi-objective optimization framework","","5","","14","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","","978-1-4244-5175-3","978-1-4244-5176-0","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","0","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These vital signs are periodically reported back to a monitor using agents we designed for effective reporting (ER). These ER agents are installed in hosts and routers throughout the network.

As a result, a 1.07 MB update was reduced to only 3,756 B. These updates are received by the ER monitor(s) and analyzed using existing intrusion detection and prevention systems providing a means to diagnose and isolate potential health hazards within the network that are not perceptible to individual devices","","1-4244-0617-X","1-4244-0618-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086884","","Communication system security;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Erbium;Information security;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Protection","intranets;mobile agents;mobile radio;monitoring;telecommunication security","ER agents;corporate network;effective reporting;health hazards;mobile device monitoring","","0","","10","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SQL injection attacks (SQLIAs) are one of the most significant of such threats. Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","","978-1-4244-4678-0","978-0-7695-3760-3","10.1109/LADC.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325","Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks","Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes","security of data","Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach","","3","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Now the research is going on On-Line Updates for local agents and global agents individually in high data rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), when the network has maximum mobility and maximum data rate.","","978-1-4673-0270-8","","10.1109/ICCCA.2012.6179178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179178","Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes;Intrusion Detection;Key management;Wireless Sensor Networks","Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Noise measurement;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","error statistics;protocols;self-adjusting systems;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DYDOG;WSN;data flow;dynamic intrusion detection node;dynamic intrusion detection protocol model;global agent;high error rate wireless sensor network;intrusion monitoring node;local agent;maximum data rate;maximum mobility;network attack;one-hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;physical environment;secure session key management;self-organizing sensor node;two hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;wireless environment","","3","","11","","","22-24 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control. The paper describes the status of relevant specifications and implementations for a number of standardized automation protocols.

Many intrusion detection systems have been proposed and most of them are tightly related to routing protocols, such as Watchdog/Pathrater and Routeguard. These solutions include two parts: intrusion detection (Watchdog) and response (Pathrater and Routeguard). Watchdog resides in each node and is based on overhearing. Through overhearing, each node can detect the malicious action of its neighbors and report other nodes. However, if the node that is overhearing and reporting itself is malicious, then it can cause serious impact on network performance. In this paper, we overcome the weakness of Watchdog and introduce our intrusion detection system called ExWatchdog. The main feature of the proposed system is its ability to discover malicious nodes which can partition the network by falsely reporting other nodes as misbehaving and then proceeds to protect the network. Simulation results show that our system decrease the overhead greatly, though it does not increase the throughput obviously.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288867","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communications Society;Computer networks;Information science;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","Pathrater;Routeguard;Watchdog;intrusion detection system;mobile wireless ad hoc networks;routing protocols","","14","","11","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack. The latter needs more computations; however, it has a higher performance and a very low network overhead.

This programmability is typically achieved through software-programmable packet processing systems. One key concern with the proliferation of these programmable devices throughout the Internet is the potential impact of software vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely. We present a design and proof-of-concept implementation of a packet processing system that uses two security techniques to defend against potential attacks: a processing monitor is used to track operations on each processor core to detect attacks at the processing instruction level; an I/O monitor is used to track operations of the router to detect attacks at the protocol level. Our prototype implementation on the NetFPGA system shows that these monitors can be implemented to operate at high data rates and with little additional hardware resources.","","978-1-4244-9127-8","978-1-4503-0379-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5623847","Design;Performance;Security","Computer crime;Hardware;Monitoring;Prototypes;Routing protocols","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","I-O monitor;Internet;NetFPGA system;instruction level processing;processing monitor;programmable devices;protocol level;secure packet processor design;software vulnerabilities;software-programmable packet processing systems","","4","","30","","","25-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secure multiparty computation approaches provides a possible solution for computation time data protection, but are too costly (in communication) to be practical. In this paper, we design an adaptive multi-level secure computation algorithm with the goals of reducing the average communication overheads. The adaptive algorithm runs a less secure protocol to reduce the communication overhead when there is no threat. The system adapts to a more secure but less efficient protocol when security threat is detected. Thus, the system yields better performance at normal execution time while still assures security protection at the presence of security threats.","1521-9097","0-7695-2281-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2005.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531105","","Communication system security;Computer science;Data security;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols;Scattering","information systems;protocols;security of data","adaptive multilevel secure computation;adaptive multiparty protocol;information systems;secure data protection;secure protocol","","2","","19","","","20-22 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The major operation in a signature-matching IDS is matching values seen operation to known black-listed values, as such, our solution implements the string-matching on the GPU.

For example, an intrusion detection system would reduce the number of false positives if, in addition to the alarm, the system would also transmitted a picture or video of the intruder. The problem is how to overcome the known limitations of current wireless sensor networks to support multimedia applications in terms of throughput, delay and jitter while being energy efficient. This paper presents LEMR-multichannel, an extension of LEMR for real-time applications over wireless sensor networks to address these issues. LEMR-multichannel takes advantage of the delay, jitter and energy-efficiency of LEMR, and includes an energyefficient new dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism that uses the different channels available in the single transceiver device to enhance the throughput capability of the network. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of LEMR-multichannel in terms of these performance metrics when compared with well-known protocols, such as LEMR, S-MAC, TMAC and SCP-MAC.","1548-0992","","","10.1109/TLA.2010.5595126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5595126","Cross-layer design;Energy;Jitter;Latency;MAC;Multimedia;Routing;Throughput;Wireless Sensor Network","Irrigation;Jitter;Multimedia communication;Silicon compounds;Streaming media;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","multimedia communication;real-time systems;wireless sensor networks","LEMR-multichannel;adaptive multi-channel approach;dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism;real-time multimedia wireless sensor networks","","1","","14","","","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

OLSR uses two kinds of the control messages: Hello and Topology Control (TC). As these messages are un-authenticated, OLSR is prone to several attacks namely, black hole, wormhole, Gray hole etc. This paper is focused at Sleep Deprivation Torture Attack on OLSR. Sleep deprivation attack is one of the most interesting attack in layer 2 where the attacker tries to use a low energy node until all its energy is exhausted and the node goes into permanent sleep. This attack is also possible in routing level. In OLSR low energy node declare their status through willingness property of HELLO message. Using this information an attacker node can choose that low energy node deliberately and forward all traffic through that node. This leads to low energy node in a permanent sleep mode. In this paper we propose a specification based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for that type of attack. The performance of the propose algorithm is studied by Network Simulator (NS2) and effectiveness of the propose scheme, along with a comparison with existing techniques is demonstrated.","2375-5822","978-1-4799-7548-8","","10.1109/CINE.2015.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7053818","Energy efficiency;Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Optimized Link State routing (OLSR);Sleep Deprivation Torture Attack;Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)","Batteries;Energy efficiency;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","control messages;intrusion detection system;low energy node;network simulator;optimized link state routing;permanent sleep mode;power-aware OLSR;proactive routing protocol;sleep deprivation torture attack;topology control;wireless sensor network","","0","","17","","","12-13 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among those attacks routing attack is the most severe one. To systematically cope up with this routing attack, Risk Aware Response Mechanism is used. In these mechanism IDS is used which detects malicious activities caused by malicious nodes, Based on the risk of attack, temporary decision is made whether isolation is needed or not. IDS used in risk aware response mechanism is static based approach. Hence rule set in IDS has to be updated often by the network administrator if there are any new emerging attacks. In this paper, we propose a Authorization Enforcement Facility which uses risk as an input to determine how much a source node can be trusted. AEF considers both static approach as well as dynamic conditions in order to achieve better security and allow only secure communication to takes place between source and destination.","","978-1-4673-5786-9","","10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6508360","Authorization Enforcement Facility;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Adhoc Networks;Risk Aware;security","Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Routing protocols","authorisation;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing","IDS;MANET;authorization enforcement facility;dynamic conditions;dynamic infrastructure;malicious nodes;network administrator;risk aware response mechanism;routing attack;secure access;static based approach;temporary decision","","0","","13","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Reduction of False Alarm Rate in Detecting Network Anomaly using Mahalanobis Distance and Similarity Measure","Srinivasan, N.; Vaidehi, V.","Dept. of Inf.

International Conference on","20071105","2007","","","366","371","This paper discusses about a network anomaly detection system which is aimed at reduction of the number of false positives and negatives generated by conventional IDSs. A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack. This system is designed to be integrated into other detectors in order to mitigate false positive rates so that this enriches the chances of detecting zero-day worms and new attack exploits","","1-4244-0997-7","1-4244-0997-7","10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156646","","Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Phase detection;Phase measurement;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis","IDS;Mahalanobis distance;clustering phase;false alarm rate;incremental learning algorithm;network anomaly detection system;network traffic;statistical model;value-byte frequency","","0","","15","","","22-24 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
