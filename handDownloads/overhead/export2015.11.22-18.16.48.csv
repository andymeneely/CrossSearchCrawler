A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","","978-1-4673-2433-5","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We exploit the huge many-core computational power by adopting a hybrid parallel architecture combining data and pipeline parallelism. We also design a hybrid load balancing scheme, using both ruleset and flow space partitioning. Furthermore, the proposed design leverages particular features of the processor to break the bottlenecks.

Third International Conference on","20080122","2007","","","72","72","As one of the key methods as well as a bottleneck for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSes) to detect and eliminate malicious traffic, pattern matching is increasingly gaining popularity while also faces threats from hackers' overloading attempts. The support of mixed case-sensitive and case-insensitive patterns, which is essential for NIDSes to detect possible attacks targeting different applications and operating systems, is currently a potential vulnerability since the widely used <i>Convert-Search-Verify</i> (CSV) approach encounters severe performance degradation in the worst-case scenarios. This paper firstly gives a thorough analysis on the reasons causing jams in the worst case, and then boosts up the performance by leveraging a novel mechanism named Convert-Search-incrementally-Verify (CSiV). CSiV differs from CSV in that it first merges possible case-sensitive matches to suspicious segments in the ""Search"" phase, and then leverages an Aho-Corasick like algorithm to verify them. The infeasibility of the simple <i>Double Search</i> (DS) approach is also explained by analyzing its low average-case throughput. Extensive experiments based on real pattern sets along with both collected and artificial traffic traces show that, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms the DS approach by a factor of 2 in the ordinary cases, and is better than the CSV approach up to 5 times under the worst-case scenario, indicating both its feasibility and robustness for a worst-case safe NIDS.","","978-0-7695-2858-9","","10.1109/ICNS.2007.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438321","","Computer hacking;Degradation;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","Internet;pattern matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;case-insensitive pattern matching;convert-search-incrementally-verify approach;double search approach;mixed case-sensitive pattern matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;network traffic;operating system","","0","","15","","","19-25 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance.

IEEE","20080502","2008","","","","","Achieving secure time-synchronization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a challenging, but very important problem that has not yet been addressed effectively. This paper proposes an attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol (ATSP) in which sensor nodes cooperate to safeguard the time- synchronization service against malicious attacks. ATSP exploits the high temporal correlation existing among adjacent nodes in a WSN to achieve (1) adaptive management of the profile of each sensor's normal behavior, (2) distributed, cooperative detection of falsified clock values advertised by attackers or compromised nodes, and (3) significant improvement of synchronization accuracy and stability by effectively compensating the clock drifts with the calibrated clock. To reduce the risk of losing time-synchronization due to attacks on the reference node, ATSP utilizes distributed, mutual synchronization and confines the impact of attacks to a local area (where attacks took place). Furthermore, by maintaining an accurate profile of sensors' normal synchronization behaviors, ATSP detects various critical attacks while incurring only reasonable communication and computation overheads, making ATSP attack-tolerant and ideal for resource-constrained WSNs.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509612","","Broadcasting;Clocks;Communications Society;Computer networks;Military computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Security;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-tolerant time-synchronization protocol;temporal correlation;wireless sensor network","","9","","26","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its unique infrastructure, it creates a number of consequential challenges to the security design. There is a need to make a decent tradeoff between security and performance. In mobile ad hoc networks where the network topology animatedly changes traditional security methods cannot be applied efficiently. Different security schemes against attack improves the performance of network even in the presence of attacker and tries to disable misbehavior activity. In this paper we have proposed an enhanced security scheme against jamming attack with AOMDV routing protocol. The jamming attacker delivers huge amount of unauthorized packets in the network and as a result network gets congested. The proposed scheme identifies the jamming attacker and blocks its activities by identifying the infected or unauthorized packets in network. Multipath routing protocol AOMDV is used to improve the network performance but there is a condition that jamming phase occurs naturally and is not achieved by attacker intentionally. In presence of attacker security scheme always provides the secure path and through multipath routing the possibility of secure routing is enhanced. Simulation results and PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) values of each node clearly shows better network performance in case of security scheme in presence of Jamming attack.","2347-9337","","","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012891","AOMDV;Attack;MANET;Routing;Security","Bandwidth;Jamming;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","jamming;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;PDR;enhanced security scheme;jamming attack;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing protocol AOMDV;network topology;packet delivery ratio;security design;unauthorized packets","","0","","8","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed. Experiments based on simulation show that the proposed cross-layer approach aided by a combination of SVM and FDA performs significantly better than other existing approaches.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374416","Cross-layer design;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;routing attacks;sinking.","","ad hoc networks;radio networks;support vector machines;telecommunication security","Fisher discriminant analysis;MAC layer;autonomous host-based intrusion detection;cross-layer detection;malicious node behavior;malicious sinking behavior;packet drop ratio;security vulnerabilities;support vector machines;traffic density;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","28","","2010-01-08","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to make attacks more difficult to discover, sophisticated attackers could hide their original IP address by using spoofing techniques, or they can cover themselves by launching attacks behind the proxy. This paper provides a detection and IP traceback mechanism that be able to identify a source of DoS attacks in three different scenarios. By setting up the experiment, the experimental results demonstrate that our approach is able to detect a computer that generates denial-of-service attacks, even these attacks are located behind a proxy.","","978-1-4799-3196-5","","10.1109/InfoSEEE.2014.6946246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6946246","Denial-of-Service Attacks;IP Traceback System","Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","IP networks;computer network security","DoS attacks tracing;IP traceback mechanism;IP traceback system;denial-of-service attacks tracing;network administrators;original IP address;sophisticated attackers","","0","","9","","","26-28 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed. The major findings from the game models used for these different access schemes are highlighted.

This distributed mechanism enables our system to effectively operate within large scale and high traffic rate networks. We developed a grouping mechanism which divides computers in the network into subsets of computers with a leader and a few members. Subsequently, using a data sharing mechanism we were able to detect distributed attacks. Our data sharing mechanism added an overhead on the network traffic which is negligible compared to the overall network traffic. We simulated our method in NS2 simulation environment. Then we compared our proposed system with a centralized IDS in terms of detection rate, memory usage and packet loss rate. Results showed that our system's performance was better despite of some extra load imposed by distribution of data processing.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2013.6767356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767356","Centralized IDS;DARPA 1999;Distributed IDS;Intrusion detection system;NS2 simulator;Nmap;Scan attack","Computer architecture;Computers;Data processing;Distributed databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;local area networks;telecommunication traffic","NS2 simulation environment;centralized IDS;computer networks;data capturie;data sharing mechanism;distributed attacks;distributed intrusion detection system;grouping mechanism;high traffic rate networks;large scale networks;network attacks;network traffic;packet loss rate","","0","","15","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two means of enforcing this atomicity: one is the use of lock-based synchronization and the other is the use of software transactional memory (STM). However, it is difficult to predict which one is more suitable for an application than the other without trying both mechanisms because their performance heavily depends on the application. We have developed a system named SAW that decouples the synchronization mechanism from the application logic of a Java program and enables the programmer to statically select a suitable synchronization mechanism from a lock or an STM. We introduce annotations to specify critical sections and shared objects. In accordance with the annotated source program and the programmer's choice of a synchronization mechanism, SAW generates aspects representing the synchronization processing. By comparing the rewriting cost using SAW and that using individual synchronization mechanism directly, we show that SAW relieves the programmer's burden. Through several benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAW is an effective way of switching synchronization mechanisms according to the characteristics of each application.","1521-9097","978-1-4577-1875-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121266","Java;aspect;lock;software transactional memory;synchronization","Cloning;Java;Libraries;Software;Surface acoustic waves;Synchronization;Weaving","Java;shared memory systems;synchronisation;transaction processing","Java synchronization selection;atomic execution;lock-based synchronization;sequential program rewriting;shared memory;software transactional memory;synchronization aspect weaving;unexpected inconsistency avoidance","","0","","21","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, security modules in conventional kernel-level reference monitors are usually not portable to other kernels and require detailed knowledge about kernel internals. Furthermore, different security modules are often not composable and conflict with each other. This paper describes a reference monitor called SysGuard that addresses these problems. SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability. The guard scoping on a per-process basis improves composability of individual guards, and it is implemented efficiently by using a per-process jump table of system calls. This paper describes the implementation of restricted execution environments for networks by composing simple and portable guards, and shows the advantages of the SysGuard security framework.","","0-7695-1852-4","","10.1109/PRDC.2002.1185635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185635","","Access control;Computer bugs;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Guidelines;Kernel;Monitoring;Operating systems;Portable computers;Security","authorisation;operating system kernels;software portability;system monitoring","SysGuard;access control;guards;networks;operating system kernels;per-process jump table;portable composable kernel module;reference monitors;restricted execution environments;security modules;system calls","","2","","19","","","16-18 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to resolve these problems, we propose a novel flexible architecture VNIDA which is based on virtual machine monitor (VMM) and has no-intrusive behavior to target system after studying popular IDS architectures. In this architecture, a separate intrusion detection domain (IDD) is added to provide intrusion detection services for all virtual machines. Specially, an IDD helper is introduced to take response to the intrusions according to the security policies. Moreover, event sensors and IDS stub, as the core components of IDS, are separately isolated from target systems, so strong reliability is also achieved in this architecture. To show the feasibility of the VNIDA, we implement a prototype based on the proposed architecture. Based on the prototype, we employed some rootkits to evaluate our VNIDA, and the results shows that VNIDA has the ability to detect them efficiently, even some potential intrusions. In addition, system performance evaluation also shows that VNIDA only introduce less than 1.25% extra overhead.","","978-0-7695-3090-1","","10.1109/WKDD.2008.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470467","","Buildings;Computer architecture;Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Open source software;Prototypes;Software engineering","authorisation;software architecture;virtual machines","detection evasion;intrusion containment;intrusion detection domain;intrusion detection system;security policies;system resource;unauthorized access prevention;virtual machine monitor","","2","","22","","","23-24 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, but failed to address other important security attributes such as availability and integrity (e.g. denial of service, session hijacking and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper we describe an anomaly-based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks, based on tempo-spatial data analysis technique to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocol is based on n-gram pattern analysis. We apply statistical techniques to quantify the n-transition patterns in the protocol and determine the probabilities of these transitions being normal.","","978-1-4673-5287-1","978-1-4673-5286-4","10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504111","","Communication system security;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Protocols;Security;Training;Wireless networks","computer network security;protocols;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 anomaly-based behavior analysis;IEEE 802.11 wireless networks;MAC address spoofing attack;anomaly behavior analysis;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;banking accounts;confidentiality issue;credit cards;denial of service attack;e-mails;n-gram pattern analysis;n-transition patterns;privacy issue;security issue;security protocols;session hijacking attack;social network credentials;tempo-spatial data analysis technique;transfer critical information;wireless network attacks;wireless networks","","1","","6","","","28-31 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distributed wireless sensor networks have problems on detecting and preventing malicious nodes which always bring destructive threats and compromise multiple sensor nodes. Therefore, sensor networks need to support an authentication service for sensor identity and message transmission. Furthermore, intrusion detection and prevention schemes are always integrated in sensor security appliances so that they can enhance network security by discovering malicious or compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware protocol for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Detection system is implemented based on learning automata concept.

In power transmission segments of smart grid, wired communications are usually adopted to ensure robustness of the backbone power network. In contrast, for a power distribution grid, wireless communications provide many benefits such as low cost high speed links, easy setup of connections among different devices/appliances, and so on. Connecting power equipment, devices, and appliances through wireless networks is indispensable for a smart distribution grid (SDG). However, wireless communications are usually more vulnerable to security attacks than wired ones. Developing appropriate wireless communication architecture and its security measures is extremely important for an SDG. Thus, these two problems are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a wireless communication architecture is proposed for an SDG based on wireless mesh networks (WMNs). The security framework under this communication architecture is then analyzed. More specifically, potential security attacks and possible counter-attack measures are studied. Within the security framework, a new intrusion detection and response scheme, called smart tracking firewall, is developed to meet the special requirements of SDG wireless communications. Performance results show that the smart tracking firewall can quickly detect and respond to security attacks and is thus suitable for real-time operation of an SDG.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2011.2167354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6060942","Security;smart distirbution grid;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Communication system security;Network security;Physical layer;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","power distribution;power system security;safety systems;smart power grids;wireless mesh networks","SDG;WMN;backbone power network;intrusion detection;low cost high speed links;power transmission;response scheme;security framework;smart power distribution grid;smart tracking firewall;wireless communication network;wireless mesh networks;wireless networks","","30","","24","","2011-10-25","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We investigate mechanisms to exploit temporal locality in a networking application and choose Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) as a case study. An IDS like the popular Snort [4] operates by scanning packet payload for known attack strings. It first builds a Finite State Machine (FSM) from a database of attack strings, and traverses this FSM using bytes from the packet payload. So we propose a redundancy-aware FSM traversal that skips the processing of redundant bytes.

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption. Finally, we show that our approach is easy to install and configure across all Android platforms including mobile phones, tablets, and small notebooks without any user perceivable delay for most of the regular Android applications.","","978-1-4673-1796-2","978-0-7695-4713-8","10.1109/MDM.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341374","Encrypted filesystem;Full disk encryption;I/O performance;Smart handheld devices","Databases;Encryption;Kernel;Libraries;Smart phones","cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;input-output programs;smart phones;telecommunication security","Android;FUSE;I/O-intensive program;NIST certified cryptographic algorithm;PII data;SMS;data-at-rest;database transaction performance;email;encrypted operation;encryption filesystem;end user privacy;file system in user space;heterogeneous smart gadget device;location-based service;mobile device;personal identifiable information;read operation;security;smart handheld device;smart phone;social media;tablet;write operation","","5","","33","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system ensures high service availability for the network members through a number of schemes. A novel behavior grading mechanism provides security criteria for the network nodes and aids the management functions of the KMS to revoke or reissue certificates for nodes.

In grid computing, heterogeneous resources distributed geographically are virtualized as a unified whole. Grid computing, as a result, provides enormous opportunities in terms of resource sharing, maximization of resource utilization and virtualization of resources. Because of its immense potential, not only the scientific community, but also the IT enterprise communities are excited about its prospect.

This paper focuses on compressed HTTP traffic. HTTP uses GZIP compression and requires some kind of decompression phase before performing a string matching. We present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP (ACCH), that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern-matching algorithm.

Surprisingly, we show that it is faster to perform pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than on regular traffic.

"A Memory Efficient Multiple Pattern Matching Architecture for Network Security","Tian Song; Wei Zhang; Dongsheng Wang; Yibo Xue","Tsinghua Univ., Beijing","INFOCOM 2008. The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE","20080502","2008","","","","","Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters. A single architecture is memory efficient for large pattern set, and it is possible to support more than 10 M patterns with at most half amount of the memory utilization compared to the state-of-the-art architectures.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509637","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Communications Society;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching","cache storage;computer networks;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;telecommunication security","ACC algorithm;cached deterministic finite automate;computer network security;content inspection based application;memory efficient multiple pattern matching architecture;next-state addressing scheme","","21","3","23","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The typical means by which an attacker breaks into a network is through a series of exploits, where each exploit in the series satisfies the pre-condition for subsequent exploits and makes a causal relationship among them. Such a series of exploits constitutes an attack path and the set of all possible attack paths form an attack graph. Present day vulnerability scanners are able to identify the vulnerabilities in isolation but there is a need for correlation among these vulnerabilities to identify overall risk of the network. In this paper we propose a novel approach by finding out an attack path consisting of logically connected exploits and extends it to an attack graph. The solution also finds out the set of root cause vulnerabilities for overall security threat while taking care the inherent time and scalability problem of attack graph generation.","","0-7695-3072-9","978-0-7695-3072-7","10.1109/CIS.2007.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4415455","","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial intelligence;Binary decision diagrams;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Equations;Information security;Information technology;Risk management;Scalability","","","","0","","12","","","15-19 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed.

The pre-determined IDS architecture may lead to overloading of a part of the cloud due to the extra detection overhead. This paper proposes a neural network based IDS which is a distributed system with an adaptive architecture so as to make full use of the available resources without overloading any single machine in the cloud. Moreover, with the machine learning ability from the neural network, the proposed IDS can detect new types of attacks with fairly accurate results.

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors. A set of simulations is conducted for validating the feasibility and evaluating the performance of our proposed framework.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199233","","Autonomous agents;Communications Society;Cost function;Event detection;Humans;Impedance;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Optimization methods","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","ADRS sensor;MANET;accidental system errors;anomalous events;autonomous agent;cost-sensitive anomaly detection;decision-theoretical framework;detection accuracy;detection cost;detection performance;false positive rate;intentional attacks;key evaluation metrics;mobile ad hoc networks;operational cost;policy gradient algorithms;response cost;response system","","0","","14","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization approach based on the behavioral study of animals/birds that outperforms GA in some applications. Therefore, the PSO based method is proposed in feature subset selection in this research work.","","978-1-4799-4420-0","","10.1109/ITAIC.2014.7065007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065007","Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm (GA);Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO);Subset","Computers;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature selection;genetic algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data","GA;PCA;PSO;computer systems;discriminative subset;eigenspace;eigenvalues;false alarms;feature subset selection;genetic algorithm;network systems;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;principal component analysis;robust intrusion detection system","","0","","20","","","20-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our architecture exploits multisensor data and supplementary information to identify defectors based on deviations from predicted values and correlated measurements and behavior. Furthermore multi-hop communication complexity is minimized to ensure robustness in environments with limited connectivity and frequent network partitioning.

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).","","978-1-4244-2777-2","978-1-4244-2778-9","10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093","","Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system","","19","1","28","","","14-16 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques. Finally, some significant research problems are identified for enlightening the subsequent studies.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2257594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942184","Cyber-physical system (CPS);intrusion detection;security;security.","Actuators;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Real-time systems;Reliability;Security;Sensors","control engineering computing;embedded systems;industrial control;production engineering computing;security of data","CPS;critical infrastructures;cyber attacks;cyber-physical systems;detection techniques;embedded computers;industrial control systems;instruction detection mechanism;physical processes","","0","","51","","2014-10-31","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At the link adaptation layer, the virtual interface provides link transparency to the upper layers and session management is handled at the interface manager. At the network layer, most IP-based ad hoc routing protocols can be accommodated. At the transport layer, the transport manager is instructed by the interface manager to adapt the transmission rate according to the new wireless link. Finally, at the application layer, the security manager handles various aspects of security concerns. Simulation results show that our approach can deliver low packet loss, low latency, and smooth handoff solutions with minimum packet overhead. Further, our research on IEEE 802.21 reveals that current media independent handover (MIH) may serve as a component in our integrated architecture. In conclusion, our work represents the first complete solution that provides seamless soft handoff in ad hoc networks with minimum service disruption","","1-4244-0617-X","1-4244-0618-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086867","","Ad hoc networks;Automation;Bandwidth;Computer science;Delay;Ground penetrating radar;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Packet switching;Switches","IP networks;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","IEEE 802.21;IP-based ad hoc routing protocol;MIH;integrated architecture;link transparency;media independent handover;mobile ad hoc networks;seamless soft handoff;security manager;session management;virtual interface;wireless link","","3","","11","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, Linux 2.6 includes the Linux security modules (LSM) framework that enables the enforcement of MAC policies (e.g., type enforcement or multi-level security) for individual systems. While this is a start, we envision that MAC enforcement should span multiple machines. The goal is to be able to control interaction between applications on different machines based on MAC policy. In this paper, we describe a recent extension of the LSM framework that enables labeled network communication via IPsec that is now available in mainline Linux as of version 2.6.16. This functionality enables machines to control communication with processes on other machines based on the security label assigned to an IPsec security association. We outline a security architecture based on labeled IPsec to enable distributed MAC authorization. In particular, we examine the construction of a xinetd service that uses labeled IPsec to limit client access on Linux 2.6.16 systems.

This suggests that it could be useful for a computer system to pretend it is a honeypot, to scare away smarter attackers. We examine here from a number of perspectives how this could be accomplished as a kind of ""vaccination"" of systems to reduce numbers of attacks and their severity. We develop a mathematical model of what would make an attacker go away. We report experiments with deliberate distortions on text to see at what point people could detect deception, and discover they can respond to subtle clues. We also report experiments with real attackers against a honeypot of increasing obviousness.

ANC computing can also result in a much less delay and more flexibility than if such information processing is done centrally in a data center in the core. In this paper, we formulate two representative optimization problems related to Flow Inspection Router Assignment (FIRA) in ANCs. Their objectives are to minimize the (weighted) number of flows that still need to be inspected inside the enterprise network when only some flows can be assigned to the ANC due to the additional flow inspection delay in the ANC, and when all the flows can be assigned to the ANC, to minimize the additional flow inspection delay, respectively. We prove the NP-hardness of these two new problems, study their performance bounds and propose efficient heuristics. We further extend the formulation and solution to support multicast flows. Simulation shows that our heuristic algorithms can perform close to their performance bounds, implying their near optimality and the tightness of the bounds. In addition, simulation also demonstrates how inspection computing resources can be reduced for multicast flows.","1545-0678","978-1-4673-1423-7","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2012.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258190","","Delay;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Inspection;Logic gates;Optimization;Upper bound","","","","0","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to split the traffic to the sensors is the key problem of a parallel intrusion detection system. To resolve the problems, load balance has to be concerned. There is an emerging need for parallel intrusion detection techniques that can keep up with the increasing network throughput. A novel algorithm of load balance in the parallel IDS (intrusion detection system) was proposed to improve detection ability of parallel IDS. The algorithm was adopted to hash the network packet header information in data packet, to map the corresponding packet to the scope of the sensors' number, and to adjust the scope according to the performance and load of each sensor. Theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can dispatch data packets reasonably and utilize all the sensors' sources effectively.","","978-1-4244-3746-7","","10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731402","hash function;high availability;load balancing;parallel IDS","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Educational technology;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Round robin;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer networks;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data packet;dynamic adaptive load balance algorithm;network packet header information;network throughput;network-based intrusion detection system;parallel intrusion detection system","","0","","9","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key management for SAN entities and allow scalable data sharing. We use strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities, thereby removing bottlenecks at disks and causing minimal inconvenience to hosts.

Experimental results show that even for a simple 3-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by a Markov model. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator.

However, due to operational mistakes, malicious intent of insiders or vulnerabilities exploited by outsiders, data stored in a database can still be compromised. When the database is under an attack, rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are the most used mechanisms during system recovery. This kind of mechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service during repair, which causes unacceptable availability loss or denial-of- service for mission critical applications, or may cause serious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean data items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new transactions. To resolve this dilemma, we devise a novel mechanism, called database firewall in this paper. This firewall is designed to protect good data from being corrupted due to damage spreading. Pattern mining and Bayesian network techniques are adopted in the framework to mine frequent damage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity in the face of attack. Our approach provides a probability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the fly. With this feature, the database firewall is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to dynamically filter out the potential spreading transactions.","1063-9527","0-7695-2716-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2006.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041189","","Access control;Availability;Bayesian methods;Database systems;Filtering;Mission critical systems;Protection;Spatial databases;System recovery;Transaction databases","","","","4","","24","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.","1542-1201","978-1-4673-0267-8","978-1-4673-0268-5","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices","","0","","19","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

What are necessary and prudent efforts when a customer calls with a major security problem that needs to be fixed with a proven, off-the-approval-list, multi-layered integrated system with high visibility and limited funding and expires at the end of the Fiscal Year? Whether driven by budget cycles, safety, or by management decree, many such projects begin with generic scopes and funding allocated based on a rapid management ""guestimate."" Then a Project Manager (PM) is assigned a project with a predefined and potentially limited scope, compressed schedule, and potentially insufficient funding. The PM is tasked to rapidly and cost effectively coordinate a requirements-based design, implementation, test, and turnover of a fully operational system to the customer, all while the customer is operating and maintaining an existing security system. Many project management manuals call this an impossible project that should not be attempted. However, security is serious business and the reality is that rapid deployment of proven systems via an ""Extreme Project"" is sometimes necessary. Extreme Projects can be wildly successful but require a dedicated team of security professionals lead by an experienced project manager using a highly-tailored and agile project management process with management support at all levels, all combined with significant interface with the customer. This paper does not advocate such projects or condone eliminating the valuable analysis and project management techniques. Indeed, having worked on a well-planned project provides the basis for experienced team members to complete Extreme Projects. This paper does, however, provide insight into what it takes for projects t- - o be successfully implemented and accepted when completed under extreme conditions.","1071-6572","978-1-4244-7403-5","","10.1109/CCST.2010.5678718","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678718","Extreme Project;Project Management;agile project;resources;security system implementation","Documentation;Lead;Personnel;Procurement;Project management;Schedules;Security","decision trees;project management;security of data;software management;software prototyping","decision trees;multilayered integrated system;project management;risk management;security system;software code","","0","","6","","","5-8 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have addressed the malicious nodes detection problem in ad-hoc networks using special type of learning automata in an irregular network. We have used the irregular cellular learning automata to detect anomalies in two levels.

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","36","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With the increase of IP traffic, such traffic analysis applications need to cope with a constantly increasing number of flow records. Typically, centralized approaches to IP traffic analysis have scalability problems, which are addressed by replacing existing hardware with more powerful CPUs and faster memory. In contrast, this paper developed and implemented SCRIPT (Scalable Real-time IP Flow Record Analysis), which defines a scalable analysis framework that can be used to distribute flow records to multiple nodes performing traffic analysis in order to balance the overall workload among those nodes.

The STAKCERT framework consists of 2 phases where in phase 1, a novel standard operating procedure in worm detection and analysis have been introduced.

Second is that the worm's selection of infection targets does not consider which hosts its infected host communicates too frequently.

In this paper we propose a state base signature detection model which leverages on our state aware signatures with sufficiently complete information to match these signatures. The proposed model keeps track of the state of the connection and matches the signatures within appropriate packets. We further classify our signatures that span across multiple packet and across multiple sessions. We also provide the notion of virtual signatures which represents patterns within packets in a distributed form.
