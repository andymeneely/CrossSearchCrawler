The mobility and scalability brought by wireless network made it possible in many applications. Among all the contemporary wireless networks, Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is one of the most important and unique applications. On the contrary to traditional network architecture, MANET does not require a fixed network infrastructure; every single node works as both a transmitter and a receiver. Nodes communicate directly with each other when they are both within the same communication range. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to relay messages. The self-configuring ability of nodes in MANET made it popular among critical mission applications like military use or emergency recovery. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make MANET vulnerable to malicious attackers. In this case, it is crucial to develop efficient intrusion-detection mechanisms to protect MANET from attacks. With the improvements of the technology and cut in hardware costs, we are witnessing a current trend of expanding MANETs into industrial applications. To adjust to such trend, we strongly believe that it is vital to address its potential security issues. In this paper, we propose and implement a new intrusion-detection system named Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) specially designed for MANETs. Compared to contemporary approaches, EAACK demonstrates higher malicious-behavior-detection rates in certain circumstances while does not greatly affect the network performances.","0278-0046","","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2196010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189073","Digital signature;Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK) (EAACK);Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET);digital signature algorithm (DSA)","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Receivers;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;radio transmitters;telecommunication security","EAACK;MANET;communication range;emergency recovery;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment;hardware cost;industrial application;malicious attacker;malicious-behavior-detection rate;message relay;military use;mobile ad hoc network;mobility;network architecture;network infrastructure;network performance;receiver;secure intrusion-detection system;security issue;transmitter;wireless network","","25","","35","","2012-04-26","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology. Based on the observations, we make valuable conclusions about which attacks induce more false alarm and impact on Mobile Ad Hoc Network.","","978-1-4244-9004-2","","10.1109/INTERACT.2010.5706198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706198","Attacks;MANET;Wireless Networks","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Watches;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","MANET;base station;centralized access point;constant nodes;constrained capability;distributed cooperation;dynamic topology;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;network traffics;node legitimate information;open medium;packet delivery ratio;pervasive trust management model enhancement;routing protocol;throughput;varying pause time;wireless mobile hosts","","0","","29","","","3-5 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our schemes use different independent memory noise filling techniques called pre-deployment and post-deployment noise filling, and also different communication protocols for attestation purpose. The protocols are well-suited for wireless sensor networks, where external factors , such as channel collision, result in network delay.

Multi-gigabit line-speeds combined with growing databases of rules lead to dropped packets as the load exceeds the capacity of the device. Several areas of research have attempted to mitigate this problem through improving packet inspection efficiency, increasing resources, or reducing the examined population. A popular method for reducing the population examined is to employ run-time filters that can provide a quick check to determine that a given network packet cannot match a particular rule set. While this technique is an excellent method for reducing the population under examination, rogue elements can trivially bypass such filters with specially crafted packets and render the run-time filters effectively useless. Since the filtering comes at the cost of extra processing a filtering solution could actually perform worse than a non-filtered solution under such pandemic circumstances. To defend against such attacks, it is necessary to consider run-time filters as an independent anomaly detector capable of detecting attacks against itself. Such anomaly detection, together with judicious rate-limiting of traffic forwarded to full packet inspection, allows the detection, logging, and mitigation of attacks targeted at the filters while maintaining the overall improvements in NIDS performance garnered from using run-time filters.","1550-445X","978-1-4799-3629-8","","10.1109/AINA.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838655","Deep Packet Inspection;Filters;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Run-time Filters;Security","Automata;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Limiting;Matched filters;Sociology","filters;security of data;telecommunication traffic","NIDS performance;anomaly detector;crafted packets;filtering solution;malicious traffic;multigigabit line-speeds;network intrusion detection systems;network packets;packet inspection;run-time filters;run-time filters protection","","0","","19","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The severe resource constraints in each sensor make it very challenging to secure sensor networks. Moreover, sensors are usually deployed in hostile and unattended environments, and hence, are susceptible to various attacks, including node capture, physical tampering, and manipulation of the sensor program. The authors of T. Park and K.G. Shin, (2005) proposed a soft tamper-proofing scheme that verifies the integrity of the program in each sensor device, called the program integrity verification (PIV). This paper addresses how to authenticate PIV servers (PIVSes) in a fully-distributed manner. Our distributed authentication protocol of PIVSes (DAPP) uses the Blundo scheme (C. Blundo et al., 1992) and allows sensors to authenticate PIVSes without requiring commonly-used trusted third parties, such as authentication servers (ASes), in the network. We implement and evaluate both the DAPP and the PIV on Mica2 Motes and laptops. We also analyze the security of DAPP under different attack models, demonstrating its capability to deal with various types of attacks","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198821","","Authentication;Capacitive sensors;Communication system security;Computer security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Network servers;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Blundo scheme;Mica2 Motes;distributed authentication;distributed authentication protocol;node capture;physical tampering;program integrity verification;sensor program manipulation;severe resource constraints;soft tamper-proofing scheme;wireless sensor networks security","","1","4","22","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Undoubtedly, security and end-users privacy issues rise and become more severe in the IoT, due to the asymmetric nature of the communications between sensor nodes and the ordinary Internet hosts. Many solutions propose to use the classical IP-based security protocols for IoT, after adapting them to WSN's constraints by either messages compression or computational-load distribution techniques. In this paper we propose a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) compression model for HIP (Host Identity Protocol) header, as well as, an adapted distribution scheme of the computational load in HIP's key agreement process. For an extreme lightweight end-to-end security, we propose to combine both compression and distribution models for HIP in WSNs side, in the IoT.

The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory.

"DDoS-Shield: DDoS-Resilient Scheduling to Counter Application Layer Attacks","Ranjan, S.; Swaminathan, R.; Uysal, M.; Nucci, A.; Knightly, E.","","Networking, IEEE/ACM Transactions on","20090218","2009","17","1","26","39","Countering distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is becoming ever more challenging with the vast resources and techniques increasingly available to attackers. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests.

For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds.

West Lafayette, West Lafayette, IN","Performance Analysis of Systems and software, 2008. ISPASS 2008. IEEE International Symposium on","20080507","2008","","","32","43","This paper presents and experimentally analyzes the performance of three parallelization strategies for the popular open-source Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The parallelizations include 2 conservative variants and 1 optimistic scheme. The conservative strategy parallelizes inspection at the level of TCP/IP flows, as any potential inter-packet dependences are confined to a single flow. The flows are partitioned among threads, and each flow is processed in-order at one thread. A second variation reassigns flows between threads to improve load balance but still requires that only one thread process a given flow at a time. The flow-concurrent scheme provides good performance for 3 of the 5 network packet traces studied, reaching as high as 4.1 speedup and 3.1 Gbps inspection rate on a commodity 8-core server. Dynamic reassignment does not improve performance scalability because it introduces locking overheads that offset any potential benefits of load balancing. Neither conservative version can achieve good performance, however, without enough concurrent networkflows. For this case, this paper presents an optimistic parallelization that exploits the observation that not all packets from a flow are actually connected by dependences. This system allows a single flow to be simultaneously processed by multiple threads, stalling if an actual dependence is found. The optimistic version has additional overheads that reduce speedup by 25% for traces with flow concurrency, but its benefits allow one additional trace to see substantial speedup (2.4 on five cores).","","978-1-4244-2232-6","978-1-4244-2233-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2008.4510736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510736","","Concurrent computing;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Load management;Network servers;Open source software;Performance analysis;Scalability;TCPIP;Yarn","computer networks;concurrency control;public domain software;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP-IP flow;conservative parallelization;flow concurrency;flow concurrent scheme;flow partitioning;flow reassignment;inspection parallelization;interpacket dependence;load balancing;network packet;open-source Snort network intrusion detection system;optimistic parallelization;stateful network intrusion","","4","","22","","","20-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANET is vulnerable to attacks such as Black hole attack, Gray hole attack, wormhole attack, Sybil attack, and Route table modification attack. Black hole attack has serious impact on routing and delivery ratio of packets. To overcome Black hole attack, a mechanisms such as trust based routing, intrusion detection system, sequence number comparison and Data Routing Information table (DRI) has been proposed.

Our system tracks information flows between applications of multiple hosts gathered in groups (i.e. sets of hosts sharing the same distributed information flow policy) by attaching taint labels to system objects such as files, sockets, Inter Process Communication (IPC) abstractions, and memory mappings. Labels are carried over the network by tainting network packets. A distributed information flow policy is defined for each group at the host level by labeling information and defining how users and applications can legally access, alter or transfer information towards other trusted or untrusted hosts. As opposed to existing approaches, where information is most often represented by two security levels (low/high, public/private etc.), our model identifies each piece of information within a distributed system, and defines their legal interaction in a fine-grained manner. Hosts store and exchange security labels in a peer to peer fashion, and there is no central monitor. Our IDS is implemented in the Linux kernel as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and runs standard software on commodity hardware with no required modification. The only trusted code is our modified operating system kernel. We finally present a scenario of intrusion in a web service running on multiple hosts, and show how our distributed IDS is able to report security violations at each host level.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654811","","Containers;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Protocols;Security","operating system kernels;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Linux kernel;Linux security module;distributed information flow policy;distributed intrusion detection;distributed systems;inter rocess communication abstractions;memory mappings;network packets;peer to peer fashion;security labels;taint marking","","0","","18","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The features of MANETs are like open media, dynamic changes in topology, cooperative and collaborative algorithm and no centralized monitoring system. These features make the network more prone to malicious attack. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we present a new cluster based intrusion detection algorithm that takes care of black hole attacks in a MANET. This proposed algorithm is based on trustworthiness of the nodes in a network. The network is considered to be a layered structured. The nodes are member of a cluster. Each cluster has cluster head that takes care of all the members of its own cluster and communicates with cluster head at layer 2 whenever required. The cluster head at layer 2 communicate with all cluster head at layer 1. The selection of cluster head depends on three parameters battery power, mobility and trust value of a node in a cluster. Periodically the cluster head updation is done according to three parameters. We have implemented our algorithm using the NS simulator. The performance of the proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has also been evaluated in the process.

MAID is a hierarchical, multitier, multiobservation-window, anomaly based network intrusion detection system, prototyped in our laboratory for the US Army's tactical Internet. MAID monitors several MIB II supplied network traffic parameters simultaneously, constructs a probability density function (PDF) for each, statistically compares it to a reference PDF of normal behavior using a similarity metric, then combines the results into an anomaly status vector that is classified by a neural network classifier. The data used here derive from many experiments that have been carried out in our network testbed facility that monitor 27 MIB traffic parameters simultaneously, focusing on the Denial of Service (DOS) class of attacks, including UDP, ICMP and TCP type flooding attacks. We further focused on the anomaly detector and specifically two issues: (a) the effectiveness of some alternative similarity metrics and (b) early detection, i.e., detection at low values of the ratio of attack to background traffic. Thus, we studied the effectiveness of five prominent and/or promising similarity metrics: a χ<sup>2</sup> test (CST), a Kolmogorov-Smyrnov (KS) test (KST), Kupier's KS type statistic (KKS), a combined area-KS type test (AKS), and a simpler fractional deviation from the mean statistic (FDM). We present the performance of these metrics using 9 traffic intensity scenarios, as the attack traffic decreased from 10% to 0.5% of the background. It was found that the KST metric performed slightly better overall while the FDM performed surprisingly well at low traffic intensities. It was also found that an attack/background ratio as small as 1% can be detected by MAID with corresponding misclassification rates in the range of 0.5-1.0 %. These results show promise for the use of MAID in early DOS detection using MIB traffic parameters.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232401","","Computer crime;Computer displays;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Prototypes;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;neural nets;probability;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","χ<sup>2</sup> test;AKS;CST;DOS computer network attacks;DOS intrusion detection;Denial of Service;FDM;KKS;KS type statistic;KST;Kolmogorov-Smyrnov test;MAID;MIB traffic parameters;PDF;SNMP;anomaly status vector;combined area-KS type test;early detection;fractional deviation from mean statistic;misclassification rates;multiobservation-window;network testbed facility;neural network classifier;probability density function;similarity metrics;statistical anomaly intrusion detection;traffic intensity scenarios","","13","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This latter targets some reactive routing protocols in the aim of disrupting the forwarding process in the network. Grayhole attack occurs during the route discovery phase when a malicious node drops some of received packets. The watchdog is a well-known intrusion detection mechanism and usually used to detect this kind of attack. However, watchdogs are characterized by a relatively high rate of false alerts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of watchdog based on two Bayesian filters: Bernoulli and Multinomial. We use these two models in a complementary manner to successfully detect the packet dropping attacks in mobile ad hoc networks. Based on simulation results, our filters prove that these attacks can be detected with a high rate of accuracy.","","","","10.1109/SCVT.2014.7046699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7046699","","Ad hoc networks;Bayes methods;Computer crime;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Vectors","Bayes methods;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian filter;Bernoulli filter;DoS attack detection;MANET;blackhole attack;denial of service attack detection;grayhole attack;intrusion detection mechanism;malicious node;mobile ad hoc network;mobile wireless entity;multinomial filter;packet dropping attack detection;reactive routing protocol;received packet drop;route discovery phase;self-organized network;watchdog;wormhole attack","","0","","13","","","10-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Snort, OpenDPI, Bro, L7-filter, ClamAV are a number of open-source tools based on custom DPI engines and custom rule-sets. The surging demand for higher bandwidth DPI systems capable of supporting larger rule-sets requires the use of hardware acceleration and hardware-based systems. In comparison to software based systems, the design and development of custom purpose hardware for DPI is expensive. The need for DPI solutions for a range of applications at high speed requires a unified processing platform. This paper presents the research in converting known DPI rule-sets into a meta format based on regular expressions, that can be executed by software and hardware-based processing platforms.

Our key revocation scheme offers a theoretically sound basis for a node in MANETs to predict the behavior of other nodes based on its own observations and reports from peers. In our scheme, each node keeps track of three categories of behavior defined and classified by an external trusted authority, and updates its knowledge about other nodespsila behavior with 3-dimension Dirichlet distribution. Differentiating between suspicious behavior and malicious behavior enables nodes to make multilevel response by either revoking keys of malicious nodes or ceasing the communication with suspicious nodes for some time to gather more information for making further decision. Furthermore, we also analyze the attack-resistant properties of our key revocation scheme through extensive simulations in the presence of adversaries.","","978-1-4244-2412-2","978-1-4244-2413-9","10.1109/LCN.2008.4664309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664309","","Analytical models;Bayesian methods;Identity-based encryption;Information analysis;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Packaging;Peer to peer computing;Public key;Public key cryptography","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio","Dirichlet multinomial model;attack-resistant properties;identity-based cryptography;key revocation;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;multilevel response;self-organized key revocation scheme","","0","2","22","","","14-17 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of the major techniques for network security protection, such as virtual private networks (VPN), firewalls, and network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), are all dependent on the speed and ability of packet classification. The complexity of multi-dimensional packet classification will result in large scale rule-sets, which makes it prohibitive for software implementation. Algorithms based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) can solve this problem but cause entries expansion during the range matching. Our paper introduces a new region encoding mechanism of range mapping which can eliminate the expansion. By adding a new regional code, which is used to encode the ranges spanning two regions or more, the improved mechanism is able to express all the ranges by only one entry.

In this paper, we design a model-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for sensor networks used for PCS.

A lot of conventional IDSs are signature based, although they do not identify variations of these attacks nor new attacks. This paper presents an intrusion detection system model based on the behavior of network traffic through the analysis and classification of messages. Two artificial intelligence techniques named Kohonen neural network (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to detect anomalies.

In this paper, to develop a security framework has been proposed. This security framework involves: detection of malicious nodes by the destination node, isolation of malicious nodes by discarding the path and prevention data packets by using dispersion techniques. We propose to develop a multipath reliable routing (MRR) algorithm, which determines a set of node-disjoint reliable paths. The paths are arranged in the descending order of their reliability index. Data packets are dispersed and transmitted simultaneously through the reliable disjoint paths. The primary reliable path sends the information packet containing the transmission information. At the destination, if there is mismatch between the transmission information and the data packets received, a negative feedback is sent back to the source that includes the particulars of the affected paths. The affected paths are then removed from the list of node-disjoint paths by the source. The destination can recover the data effectively by attaining reliability, since the data packets are dispersed along multiple paths using an efficient dispersion algorithm. Our simulation result shows that, when compared with existing scheme, our framework reduces overhead and delay, at the same time increasing the packet delivery ratio.","","978-1-4244-3594-4","978-1-4244-3595-1","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787688","Detection;Dispersion;Malicious;Multipath;Reliable","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Dispersion;Intrusion detection;Isolation technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Routing;Spread spectrum communication;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;data forwarding operations;dispersion techniques;efficient dispersion algorithm;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath reliable routing algorithm;negative feedback;network layer security solution;node-disjoint reliable paths;packet delivery ratio;reliability index;security attacks","","3","","17","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, the analyst needs to know in real-time that an intrusion has occurred so that an active response and recovery thread can be created rapidly. Existing intrusion detection solutions are basically after-the-fact, thereby offering very little in terms of damage confinement and restoration of service. Quick recovery is only possible if the assessment scheme has low latency and it occurs in real-time. The objective of the paper is to develop a reasoning framework to aid in the real-time detection and assessment task that is based on a novel idea of encapsulation of owner's intent. The theoretical framework developed here will help resolve dubious circumstances that may arise while inferring the premises of operations (encapsulated from owner's intent) by way of examining the observed conclusions resulting from the actual operations of the owner. This reasoning is significant in view of the fact that intrusion signaling is not a binary decision unlike error detection in traditional fault tolerance.

Therefore the Software Defined Networking (SDN) instantiation OpenFlow has been designed according to these properties. The efforts are expected to result in lower expenditure and operational costs. To reach these objectives, mechanisms of classical networks that provide established functionalities have to be revalued and either transformed or redesigned from scratch to take advantage from SDNs. In this paper we describe our vision on flow sampling suitable for traffic monitoring in those networks. Without the loss of generality our approach was specifically created to monitor the quality of service for flows. We describe monitoring as one of possibly many applications that communicate with the SDN controller via the SDN Northbound API.

In this paper, we propose a DoS mitigation technique that uses digital signatures to verify legitimate packets, and drop packets that do not pass the verification. Since nodes are selfish, they may not perform the verification in order to avoid paying the overhead. A bad packet that escapes verification along the whole network path will bring a penalty to all its forwarders. A network game can be formulated in which nodes along a network path, in optimizing their own benefits, are encouraged to act collectively to filter out bad packets. Analytical results show that Nash equilibrium can be attained for players in the proposed game, and significant benefits can be provided to forwarders such that many of the bad packets will be eliminated by verification.","","978-1-4244-0974-7","978-1-4244-0975-4","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550349","","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Computer crime;Filtering;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","21","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem with intrusion detection systems (IDSes) is that they often produce thousands of alerts daily that must be dealt with by administrators manually. To provide situational awareness, detection systems usually employ (alert, priority) mappings that are either built in the IDS without consideration of the high-level mission objectives of the infrastructure, or manually defined by administrators through a time-consuming task that requires deep system-level expertise. In this paper, we present Seclius, an online security evaluation framework that translates low-level IDS alerts into a high-level system security measure and provides a ranking of past malicious events and affected system assets based on how crucial they are for the organization. Seclius significantly reduces human involvement by automatically learning system characteristics, providing a simple formalism that administrators can use to define security requirements. Experiments on a process control network with real vulnerabilities and a multistep attack show that Seclius can accurately report system security with low performance overhead and support the time-constrained security decision-making process that is necessary for critical infrastructure.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547151","Intrusion detection systems;information flow-based analysis;system security metric","Databases;Measurement;Organizations;Probabilistic logic;Security;Web servers","security of data","IDS;IT systems;Seclius framework;critical infrastructure;high-level system security measure;information flow-based consequence-centric security metric;information systems;intrusion detection system;online security evaluation framework;time-constrained security decision-making process","","1","","","","2013-06-25","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

International","20080815","2008","","","606","613","While a variety of AIDS (anomaly-based intrusion detection system) are claimed to be fully distributed, lightweight, and ready for application, their detection cost are not always neglectable, especially when considering the fact that MANET nodes have scarce resources which usually impels them to avoid any unnecessary action. It is therefore a significant issue to optimally deploy AIDS sensors to achieve a better tradeoff between performance and detection cost. However, this optimization problem is challenging in essence because of the special characteristics of MANETs. In particular, the deployment strategy must be adaptive to capture nodes' mobility and robust to detection failures resulted from either accidental system error or intentional subversion. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, robust, and sub-optimal strategy, called ARSoS, to tackle this issue. ARSoS treats each AIDS sensor as an independent agent, and then formulates the sensors' cooperative behavior as a decentralized decision problem. Since each AIDS sensor is only aware of partial information about the other sensors and the neighboring nodes, a reward signal integrating both local observations and global detection measures is introduced to guide the overall cooperation of sensors. An online policy gradient algorithm is then applied to solve the formulated problem. To validate the ARSoS system in terms of adaptability, robustness and optimality, we conducted extensive simulations of an implemented prototype and the obtained results highlight a good performance of the system.","","978-1-4244-2201-2","978-1-4244-2202-9","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4600004","","Acoustic sensors;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computational modeling;Cost function;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Virtual prototyping;Web and internet services","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","AIDS sensor;ARSoS;MANET;adaptive strategy;anomaly detection system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;decentralized decision problem;global detection measures;local observations;mobile ad-hoc networks;online policy gradient algorithm;optimization problem;robust strategy;sub-optimal strategy","","1","","18","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to do so is through a SIP firewall, which is loosely defined as a device that blocks attacks mounted via SIP. Using this definition, a firewall is indistinguishable from a session border controller (SBC), also used by SIP service providers to secure their networks. SIP firewalls and SBCs are often deployed by SIP service providers at the periphery of the network to impose some manner of order on the SIP traffic before allowing it to enter the network. In this vein, a SIP firewall needs to effectively block many SIP attacks and distinguish a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack from a classic overload traffic arrival rate. But what exactly is a firewall and what features should it provide in its role of inspecting SIP traffic bound for the service provider's network? What are the economic and technical tradeoffs necessary for ubiquitous deployment? In this paper, we define the role of a firewall in protecting the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) or SIP-based core network, distinguish it from an SBC, and characterize the specific threats to SIP messages at the L2 (data link layer), L3 (network layer), L4 (transport layer), and L5 (session layer). We show how a SIP firewall can thwart these attacks and we propose an implementation based on a simplified, but fully hardware accelerated SIP proxy as a front end SIP firewall. Such a system naturally blocks most attacks and implements many defense mechanisms.","1089-7089","","","10.1002/bltj.20479","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6772564","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2011","","Alcatel-Lucent","Alcatel-Lucent Journal"

As such, parsers often operate at the border between untrusted data sources (e.g., the Internet) and the soft, chewy center of computer systems, where performance and security are paramount. A firewall, for instance, is precisely a trust-creating parser for Internet protocols, permitting valid packets to pass through and dropping or actively rejecting malformed packets. Despite the prevalence of finite state machines (FSMs) in both protocol specifications and protocol implementations, they have gained little traction in parser code for such protocols. Typical reasons for avoiding the FSM computation model claim poor performance, poor scalability, poor expressibility, and difficult or time-consuming programming. In this research report, we present our motivations for and designs of finite state machines to parse a variety of existing Internet protocols, both binary and ASCII. Our hand-written parsers explicitly optimize around L1 cache hit latency, branch misprediction penalty, and program-wide memory overhead to achieve aggressive performance and scalability targets. Our work demonstrates that such parsers are, contrary to popular belief, sufficiently expressive for meaningful protocols, sufficiently performant for high-throughput applications, and sufficiently simple to construct and maintain. We hope that, in light of other research demonstrating the security benefits of such parsers over more complex, Turing-complete codes, our work serves as evidence that certain ``practical'' reasons for avoiding FSM-based parsers are invalid.","","","","10.1109/SPW.2014.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6957302","","Automata;Internet;Pipelines;Program processors;Protocols;Servers;Switches","Internet;finite state machines;protocols","FSM;Internet protocols;L1 cache hit latency;branch misprediction penalty;finite state machine parsing;program-wide memory overhead;protocol implementations;protocol specifications","","0","","9","","","17-18 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a scheme to increase IDS firewall performance by merging several similar rules into more general ones and ignoring lesser relevant rules to limit the number of firewall rules. We formalise a mathematical model to compute new firewall rules and show exemplary with traffic from SIP VoIP communication networks how the calculation can be performed.

Although most hosts rely on automated and dynamic management of ARP cache entries, current implementation is well-known to be vulnerable to spoofing or denial of service (DoS) attacks. There are many tools that exploit vulnerabilities of ARP protocols, and past proposals to address the weaknesses of the `original` ARP design have been unsatisfactory. Suggestions that ARP protocol definition be modified would cause serious and unacceptable compatibility problems. Other proposals require customised hardware be installed to monitor malicious ARP traffic, and many organisations cannot afford such cost. This study demonstrates that one can effectively eliminate most threats caused by the ARP vulnerabilities by installing anti-ARP spoofing agent (ASA), which intercepts unauthenticated exchange of ARP packets and blocks potentially insecure communications. The proposed approach requires neither modification of kernel ARP software nor installation of traffic monitors. Agent uses user datagram protocol (UDP) packets to enable networking among hosts in a transparent and secure manner. The authors implemented agent software on Windows XP and conducted an experiment. The results showed that ARP hacking tools could not penetrate hosts protected by ASA.","1751-8628","","","10.1049/iet-com.2011.0566","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6219366","","","IP networks;access protocols;cache storage;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ARP cache management;ARP protocols;UDP packets;Windows XP;address resolution protocol;agent software;antiARP spoofing agent;data link layer address;denial of service attacks;kernel ARP software;network layer address;user datagram protocol packets","","1","","","","","May 1 2012","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

For such tasks, researchers typically rely on active measurements or large numbers of volunteer users. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach, which we refer to as passive crowd-based monitoring. More specifically, we use passively collected proxy logs from a global enterprise to observe differences in the quality of service (QoS) experienced by users on different continents. We also show how this technique can measure properties of the underlying infrastructures of different Web content providers. While some of these properties have been observed using active measurements, we are the first to show that many of these properties (such as location of servers) can be obtained using passive measurements of actual user activity. Passive crowd-based monitoring has the advantages that it does not add any overhead on Web infrastructure, it does not require any specific software on the clients, but still captures the performance and infrastructure observed by actual Web usage.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363979","","Gold;Google;Monitoring;Quality of service;Servers;Throughput;YouTube","Internet;quality of service","QoS;Web content providers;World Wide Web infrastructure;active measurements;passive crowd-based monitoring;passive measurements;proxy logs;quality of service","","0","","24","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, Hybrid routing approach is needed to carry out the routing using both proactive and reactive approaches. The paper proposes a Hybrid Routing algorithm which utilizes the benefits of both reactive and proactive routing in MANETs.

We argue that the features opted to detect an attack scenario is not same for all kinds of attacks. Hence here in this paper a hierarchical feature optimization for Anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (HAB-IDS) is proposed. Two classes of learning machines for IDSs are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We consider the SVM in three critical respects of IDSs: SVMs train and run an order of magnitude faster; SVMs scale much better; and SVMs give higher classification accuracy.

WSNs pose new security challenges because of their unattended nature and limited resources. Although prevention measures such as encryption and firewalls have been successfully applied, the attacker can physically access the node and modify it. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a second line of defence that can be used to mitigate this problem. Building IDSs for WSNs is a new challenge because of the limited resources of the WSN nodes. IDS solutions for sensor networks should try to minimise the use of battery of the sensor nodes in order to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper we analyse different solutions that have been proposed for intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks. More specifically we analyse the impact of popular intrusion detection systems on the life time of the WSNs. Our study is quite general since we consider IDSs that are distributed on the sensor nodes and continuously monitor the networks for evidence of attacks. We also consider IDSs that are event triggered, which means that they require agreement between nodes when a suspicious activity is detected. The agreement is used to detect the attack and isolate the attacker. We analyse the effects of IDSs on battery life. The results show that, popular oral message algorithm of Byzantine generals problem should be considered for small scale WSNs because of the overhead introduced in terms of messages exchanged for decision. We conclude our paper with properties and recommendations for IDSs working for WSNs and some future works.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296068","Energy consumption;Intrusion Detection Systems;Wireless Sensor Networks","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Byzantine generals problem;IDS;WSN lifetime;attack detection;encryption;environmental data monitoring;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;network lifetime;oral message algorithm;prevention measures;security challenges;spatial distributed autonomous sensors;wireless sensor network","","0","","42","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them, ""ICMP traceback (iTrace)"" is currently being considered as an industry standard by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). While the idea of iTrace is very clever, efficient, reasonably secure and practical, it suffers a serious statistic problem such that the chance for ""useful"" and ""valuable"" iTrace messages can be extremely small against various types of DDoS attacks. This implies that most of the network resources spent on generating and utilizing iTrace messages will be wasted. Therefore, we propose a simple enhancement called ""intention-driven"" iTrace, which conceptually introduces an extra bit in the routing and forwarding process.

An example is to estimate traffic with common strings in the payload and detect potential virus signatures for early alarm generation. We develop a fast, memory efficient algorithm for solving this problem as a variant of the longest common subsequence problem.

Stealthy packet dropping disrupts the packet from reaching the destination through malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performs the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. A popular method for detecting attacks in wireless networks is behavior-based detection performed by normal network nodes through overhearing the communication in their neighborhood. This leverages the open broadcast nature of wireless communication. An instantiation of this technology is local monitoring. We show that local monitoring, and the wider class of overhearing-based detection, cannot detect stealthy packet dropping attacks. Additionally, it mistakenly detects and isolates a legitimate node. We present a protocol called Sadec that can detect and isolate stealthy packet dropping attack efficiently. Sadec presents two techniques that can be overlaid on baseline local monitoring: having the neighbors maintain additional information about the routing path, and adding some checking responsibility to each neighbor. Additionally, Sadec provides an innovative mechanism to better utilize local monitoring by considerably increasing the number of nodes in a neighborhood that can do monitoring. We show through analysis and simulation experiments that baseline local monitoring fails to efficiently mitigate most of the presented attacks while SADEC successfully mitigates them.","1536-1233","","","10.1109/TMC.2010.249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677538","Keywords—Local monitoring;misrouting;multihop wireless networks;packet dropping;transmission power control.","Base stations;Monitoring;Power control;Relays;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Sadec;attacks detection;malicious behavior;multihop wireless networks;overhearing based detection;packet dropping;protocol;transmission power control;wireless ad hoc network;wireless communication","","6","","39","","2010-12-30","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many diverse, mission-critical applications are deployed, including military, rescue, healthcare, factory floor, and smart homes. Security is a fundamental requirement in such sensitive applications in order to ensure their reliable and stable operation. However, security is a fairly difficult task to achieve. The open nature of the wireless communication, the unrestricted deployment and limitations of WSNs and the existence of a variety of attacks threaten the security of a sensor network. Currently, research efforts have mainly focused on developing prevention and intrusion detection mechanisms in WSNs. Intrusion recovery is also an important aspect of security provisioning that is not given the same attention. Researchers have proposed intrusion recovery protocols to restore the network's operation when an attack is detected. Their designs are mostly based on simplified threat models, making the intrusion recovery countermeasures vulnerable to advanced threat models. Although the network may recover its operation after an attack is detected, it does not mean that the threat is eliminated. For example, a persistent adversary can adapt his intrusion strategy to compromise the deployed recovery countermeasure. This research work evaluates the robustness and reliability of well-known recovery countermeasures in WSNs against persistent adversaries. Evaluation results have shown that existing intrusion recovery solutions are vulnerable and can be exploited under different attack strategies in order to compromise the applied recovery countermeasures, and thus the network. The vulnerability assessment is carried out using ns-2 simulations in an IEEE 802.15.4 network and within the AODV context. Observations derived from the assessment contribute towards future directions that can drive new designs of intrusion recov- - ery protocols in WSNs.","1530-1346","978-1-4577-0680-6","978-1-4577-0678-3","10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983922","WSN security;advanced threat model;intrusion recovery;vulnerability assessment","Computer crime;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Switches;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;protocols;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","AODV context;IEEE 802.15.4 network;WSN;factory floor;healthcare;intrusion recovery countermeasure;ns-2 simulations;pervasive computing;protocols;smart homes;vulnerability assessment;wireless communication;wireless sensor networks","","1","","28","","","June 28 2011-July 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Research has shown that the use of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) can enable distributed application and devices to device communication, even on very resource constrained devices, and thus play an important role for IoT and CPS. In order to realize the vision of Internet of Things, communication between devices must be secured. Security mechanisms for resource constrained devices has attracted much interest from the academic community, where research groups have shown solutions like IPsec, VPN-tunnels, (D)TLS, etc. are feasible to use on this type of networks. However, even though the use of well-known security mechanisms are vital for SOA-based IoT/CPS networks and systems to be protected, they do not provide any fine-grain access control. In this paper, a CoAP-based framework for service-level access control on low-power devices is presented. The framework allows fine grain access control on a per service and method basis. For example, by using this approach a device can allow read/write access to its services to one group of users while only allowing read access to another group. Users without the right credentials are not even allowed to discover available services. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach, several implementations are presented together with test results. The aim is to provide a holistic framework for secure SOA-based low power networks comprise by resource constrain devices.","","","","10.1109/IECON.2014.7049308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7049308","","Access control;Authentication;IP networks;Protocols;Servers;Service-oriented architecture","Internet of Things;authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;service-oriented architecture;telecommunication power management","CoAP based Internet of Things;access control framework;authentication framework;available service discovery;constrained application protocol;cyber-physical systems;device communication;fine grain access control;low power device;resource constrain device;right credentials;security mechanisms;service level access control;service oriented architecture","","0","","20","","","Oct. 29 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing,","20081021","2008","","","608","612","One popular solution for reducing the resource consumption of intrusion detection system (IDS) in MANET is to elect a head-cluster (leader) to provide intrusion detection service to other nodes in the same cluster. However, such a moderate mode is only suitable when the probability of attack is low. Once the probability of attack is high, victim nodes should launch their own IDSs to detect and thwart intrusions. Such a robust mode is, however, costly with respect to energy and leads nodes to die faster. Clearly, to reduce the resource consumption of IDSs and yet keep its effectiveness, a critical issue is: when should we shift from moderate to robust mode? In this paper, we formalize this issue as a nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model that takes into consideration the tradeoff between security and IDS resource consumption. The game solution will guide the leader-IDS to find the right moment for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the security risk is high enough. To achieve this goal, the Bayesian game theory is used to analyze the interaction between the leader-IDS and intruder with incomplete information about the intruder. By solving such a game, we are able to find the threshold value for notifying the victim node to launch its IDS once the probability of attack exceeds that value. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively reduce the IDS resource consumption without sacrificing security.","","978-0-7695-3393-3","978-0-7695-3393-3","10.1109/WiMob.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654307","Game theory;Intrusion detection systems;MANET security;leader election","Communication system security;Game theory;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Protection;Robustness;Sampling methods;Switches","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile radio;probability;telecommunication security","Bayesian game theory;MANET;intrusion detection;leader election;nonzero-sum noncooperative game theoretical model;probability;resource consumption","","2","","12","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
