The test chip was designed and fabricated in IBM 90 nm CMOS technology and mushroom phase-change memory (PCM) technology. The primary challenge for enabling reliable array operation with such aggressive cell is presented, namely, severely degraded sensing margin due to significantly lower ON/OFF ratio of resistive memories (~10<sup>2</sup> for PCM) than that of traditional MOSFETs (>10<sup>5</sup> ). To address this challenge, two enabling techniques were developed and implemented in hardware: 1) two-bit encoding and 2) a clocked self-referenced sensing scheme (CSRSS). In addition, the two-bit encoding can also improve algorithmic mapping by effectively compressing TCAM entries.

Thus, it is of paramount importance to protect the networks from attackers. Consequently, the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are quickly becoming a popular requirement in building a network security infrastructure. Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT. Carried out experiments showed that our proposed system presents better performance as well as a good scalability compared to the pioneer known centralized IDS SNORT system over real traffic and a set of simulated attacks.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732386","Intrusion detection system;Misuse detection;Mobiles agents;SNORT rules","Computers;Databases;Focusing;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Monitoring","","","","0","","17","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There have been many significant advances on security threats and countermeasures in CRNs in the past few years. Our main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for CRN security to protect both unlicensed secondary users and licensed primary users. Specifically, we present the recent advances on security threats/attacks and countermeasures in CRNs focusing more on the physical layer by categorizing them in terms of their types, their existence in the CR cycle, network protocol layers (exploited during their activities and defense strategies), and game theoretic approaches. The recent important attacks and countermeasures in CRNs are also summarized in the form of tables. We also present recommendations that can be followed while implementing countermeasures to enhance CRN security.

Unlike traditional network, MANET does not have a fixed infrastructure, every single node in the network works as both a receiver and a transmitter. Nodes directly communicate with each other when they are both within their communication ranges. Otherwise, they rely on their neighbors to store and forward packets. As MANET does not require any fixed infrastructure and it is capable of self configuring, these unique characteristics made MANET ideal to be deployed in a remote or mission critical area like military use or remote exploration. However, the open medium and wide distribution of nodes in MANET leave it vulnerable to various means of attacks. It is crucial to develop suitable intrusion detection scheme to protect MANET from malicious attackers. In our previous research, we have proposed a mechanism called Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement (EAACK) scheme. Nevertheless, it suffers from the threat that it fails to detect misbehaving node when the attackers are smart enough to forge the acknowledgement packets. In this paper, we introduce Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) into the EAACK scheme, and investigate the performance of DSA in MANET. The purpose of this paper is to present an improved version of EAACK called EAACK2 that performs better in the presence of false misbehavior and partial dropping.","1550-445X","978-1-61284-313-1","978-0-7695-4337-6","10.1109/AINA.2011.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763422","DSA;Digital Signature;EAACK;MANET","Ad hoc networks;Digital signatures;Encryption;Mobile computing;Public key;Receivers","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","DSA;EAACK scheme;MANET;digital signature algorithm;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;forged acknowledgement detection;mobile ad hoc network;wireless communication mechanisms","","5","1","24","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures. Then, we insert probes in select locations in the application to enable online signature matching. To evaluate our technique, we implemented it for Java programs and applied it on Tomcat 3.0 in order to detect well-known attacks.

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server. Our emulated Minos systems running Linux and Windows have stopped several actual attacks.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and difference distance map are used for selection of significant features. This approach is able to transform high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional domain. The similarity between new incoming packets and a normal profile is determined using Euclidean distance on the simple, low-dimensional feature domain.

In this paper we present LHAP a scalable and light-weight authentication protocol for ad hoc networks. LHAP is based on two techniques: (i) hop-by-hop authentication for verifying the authenticity of all the packets transmitted in the network and (ii) one-way key chain and TESLA for packet authentication and for reducing the overhead for establishing trust among nodes.

In response, researchers have created data loss prevention systems that check outgoing traffic for known confidential information. These systems stop naive adversaries from leaking data, but are fundamentally unable to identify encrypted or obfuscated information leaks. What remains is a high-capacity pipe for tunneling data to the Internet. We present an approach for quantifying information leak capacity in network traffic. Instead of trying to detect the presence of sensitive data-an impossible task in the general case--our goal is to measure and constrain its maximum volume. We take advantage of the insight that most network traffic is repeated or determined by external information, such as protocol specifications or messages sent by a server. By filtering this data, we can isolate and quantify true information flowing from a computer. In this paper, we present measurement algorithms for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the main protocol for Web browsing. When applied to real Web browsing traffic, the algorithms were able to discount 98.5% of measured bytes and effectively isolate information leaks.","1081-6011","978-0-7695-3633-0","","10.1109/SP.2009.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207641","Forensics;HTTP;Information Leaks;Intrusion Detection;Web Traffic","Bandwidth;Cryptography;IP networks;Inspection;Internet;Network servers;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Volume measurement","Internet;hypermedia;protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;data loss prevention systems;hypertext transfer protocol;information leaks;network bandwidth;network traffic;outbound Web browsing traffic;protocol specifications","","12","1","27","","","17-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes can change position quite frequently, which mean the mobility of the network. For quick data transmission, we need a routing protocol that adapts to topology changes. For our convenience, we have proposed a fast and secure protocol which is proactive and reactive in nature. In proactive protocol, routing table updates takes place when the topology changes. In routers that use dynamic routing protocols, it is important to have fast convergence because routers could make incorrect forwarding decisions until the network has fully converged. In proactive protocol, when a new node is added in the network it takes some time to converge during that time if we want to send data to destination through that new node immediately, it takes some time to converge and then it will transmit the data. To avoid this problem we are going to use reactive protocol instead of proactive in that time that is until network converge. In proactive protocol structure, we reduced the packet size and contains only limited field. By this, the total bit size gets reduced. We propose this mechanism to avoid waiting time and to transmit data as early as possible. Also we propose a security mechanism for detecting malicious node by using central agent and process algorithm.

E-STAR combines payment and trust systems with a trust-based and energy-aware routing protocol. The payment system rewards the nodes that relay others' packets and charges those that send packets. The trust system evaluates the nodes' competence and reliability in relaying packets in terms of multi-dimensional trust values. The trust values are attached to the nodes' public-key certificates to be used in making routing decisions. We develop two routing protocols to direct traffic through those highly-trusted nodes having sufficient energy to minimize the probability of breaking the route. By this way, E-STAR can stimulate the nodes not only to relay packets, but also to maintain route stability and report correct battery energy capability. This is because any loss of trust will result in loss of future earnings. Moreover, for the efficient implementation of the trust system, the trust values are computed by processing the payment receipts. Analytical results demonstrate that E-STAR can secure the payment and trust calculation without false accusations. Simulation results demonstrate that our routing protocols can improve the packet delivery ratio and route stability.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519238","Securing heterogeneous multihop wireless networks;and secure routing protocols;packet dropping and selfishness attacks;trust systems","Heterogeneous networks;Network security;Routing protocols;Spread spectrum communication;Trust management;Wireless sensor networks","radio networks;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","E-STAR;energy capability;energy-aware routing protocol;heterogeneous multihop wireless networks;multidimensional trust values;node public-key certificates;payment system;reliable routing protocols;route stability;routing decisions;secure routing protocols;trust systems;trust-based routing protocol","","0","","25","","2013-05-23","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node. The algorithm will have the advantage of detecting packets dropped by each intermediate node, this helps solve the difficulties of finding malicious nodes by the destination node only.","","978-1-4799-3078-4","","10.1109/ICACCI.2014.6968318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6968318","Defense;Denial of Service;Malicious Node;OppNets;Opportunistic Networks;Packet Dropping Attack;security","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Routing;Security","computer network security","OppNets;opportunistic networks;packet dropping attacks","","0","","17","","","24-27 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the traditional network processor approaches of multicore and multithreading map poorly to the problem because the list is a shared data structure. While match processing can be implemented directly in hardware, hardware implementations can be extremely inflexible and lead to extremely high risk. This paper presents a novel, programmable architecture for a processor to handle the matching function. The matching engine approaches the performance of a direct hardware implementation while maintaining a high degree of flexibility and programmability. More importantly, it requires a dramatically smaller area than a conventional processor.","1552-5244","978-1-4244-1387-4","978-1-4244-1388-1","10.1109/CLUSTR.2007.4629234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4629234","","Aggregates;Control systems;Data structures;Engines;Hardware;Microprocessors;Multicore processing;Multithreading;Network interfaces;Supercomputers","application program interfaces;data structures;message passing;network interfaces;parallel machines","MPI matching function;NIC;linked list;message passing interface;network interface controller;programmable processor architecture;shared data structure;supercomputer network","","0","","29","","","17-20 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing security for these sensor networks is important, but the problem is complicated by the fact that managing cryptographic key material is hard: low-cost nodes are neither tamper-proof nor capable of performing public key cryptography efficiently. We show how the key distribution problem can be dealt with in environments with a partially present, passive adversary: a node wishing to communicate securely with other nodes simply generates a symmetric key and sends it in the clear to its neighbours. Despite the apparent insecurity of this primitive, we can use mechanisms for key updating, multipath secrecy amplification and multihop key propagation to build up extremely resilient trust networks where at most a fixed proportion of communications links can be eavesdropped. We discuss applications in which this assumption is sensible. Many systems must perforce cope with principals who are authenticated weakly, if at all; the resulting issues have often been left in the 'too hard' tray. One particular interest of sensor networks is that they present a sufficiently compact and tractable version of this problem. We can perform quantitative analyses and simulations of alternative strategies, some of which we present here. We also hope that This work may start to challenge the common belief that authentication is substantially about bootstrapping trust. We argue that, in distributed systems where the opponent can subvert any small proportion of nodes, it is more economic to invest in resilience than in bootstrapping.","1092-1648","0-7695-2161-4","","10.1109/ICNP.2004.1348111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348111","","Analytical models;Authentication;Environmental economics;Intelligent sensors;Performance analysis;Public key cryptography;Resilience;Self-organizing networks;Sensor systems;Spread spectrum communication","message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication links;wireless sensor networks","communications link;key distribution problem;key infection;key updating;low-cost node;multihop key propagation;multipath secrecy amplification;public key cryptography;self-organizing network;sensor network;smart trust","","42","2","19","","","5-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection.

OpenFlow has emerged as the de facto standard for communication between the controller and switches. Apart from providing flow control and communication interfaces, OpenFlow provides a flow level statistics collection mechanism from the data plane. It exposes a high level interface for per flow and aggregate statistics collection. Network applications can use this high level interface to monitor network status without being concerned about the low level details. In order to keep the switch design simple, this statistics collection mechanism is implemented as a pull-based service, i.e. network applications and in turn the controller has to periodically query the switches about flow statistics. The frequency of polling the switches determines monitoring accuracy and network overhead. In this paper, we focus on this trade-off between monitoring accuracy, timeliness and network overhead. We propose PayLess - a monitoring framework for SDN. PayLess provides a flexible RESTful API for flow statistics collection at different aggregation levels. It uses an adaptive statistics collection algorithm that delivers highly accurate information in real-time without incurring significant network overhead. We utilize the Floodlight controller's API to implement the proposed monitoring framework.

A host of security issues need to be addressed for such interactive grids to gain acceptance, particularly in industry. The purpose of this paper is to study these security issues. The grid security infrastructure (GSI), a component of the Globus Toolkit (I. Foster et al., 1997), creates grid credentials for every user and resource.

We propose controlled shell and controlled desktop mechanisms that restrict the user to execute only authorized commands and applications, and controlled user and super-user accounts that customize the shell and desktop using policy files.

In recent years research issues for securing MANET is burgeoning as it finds use in variety of applications. Security of communication in this type of network is paramount for secure transmission. Routing attacks has drawn sizable consideration since it could cause the most devastating damage to MANET. Even though there prevail many intrusion response techniques to alleviate such critical attacks, existing system usually tries to isolate malicious nodes based on binary or naïve fuzzy response decisions. Binary responses outcomes in the unexpected network partition, causing additional damages to the network infrastructure and naïve fuzzy responses could lead to uncertainty in countering routing attacks in MANET. This paper targets on the replica attack in MANET. A serious repercussion of the device capture attack is the node replication attacks in which adversaries deploy a large number of replicas of the compromised/ captured nodes throughout the network. Replicated nodes have all legitimate security credentials and therefore can launch various insider attacks or even take over the network effortlessly. They are undeniably “Attack multipliers” and therefore are immensely catastrophic to the network. An efficient detection scheme named Sentinel Protocol is proposed for detecting replica attack in MANET. Detailed simulation studies have confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","","","","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938709","Intrusion response;MANET;Mobile nodes;Replica attack;Sentinel Protocol","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication network routing","MANET;attack multipliers;enhanced intrusion detection system;intrusion response techniques;mobile ad hoc network;naïve fuzzy responses;network infrastructure;replica attack;routing attacks;sentinel protocol","","0","","13","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical worm attack, a worm infected host tries to spread the worm by scanning a number of other hosts thus resulting in significant number of network connections at an intermediate router. Detecting such attacks amounts to finding all hosts that are associated with unusually high number of other hosts, which is equivalent to solving the classic heavy distinct hitter problem over data streams. While several heavy distinct hitter solutions have been proposed and evaluated in a standard CPU setting, most of the above applications typically execute on special networking architectures called network processing units (NPUs). These NPUs interface with special associative memories known as the ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) to provide gigabit rate forwarding at network routers. In this paper, we describe how the integrated architecture of NPU and TCAMs can be exploited to develop high-speed solutions for heavy distinct hitters.","1063-6927","0-7695-2837-3","0-7695-2837-3","10.1109/ICDCS.2007.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268163","","Associative memory;Central Processing Unit;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Data security;Hardware;Sampling methods;Stock markets","content-addressable storage;invasive software;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","associative memory;attack detection;data streams;distributed denial of service attack;heavy distinct hitter;network packet;network processing unit;network router;security attack;ternary content addressable memory;worm attack","","2","","18","","","25-27 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed special-purpose TCAM can detect packet payloads as ""virus free"" by inspecting only a few bytes. Hence, it adaptively cancels unnecessary searches, leading to greatly reduction in the search delay time and energy dissipation. For timing robustness with low area overhead, a word circuit that stores a virus pattern is designed based on both a quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) and a bundled-data techniques. The QDI word circuit is realized by combining complementary word circuits for only a small portion of the TCAM that is sensitive to delay variations. For performance evaluation, a probability of the virus detection is calculated using a set of real packet traces from MIT DARPA. A 2048 × 128-byte asynchronous TCAM is designed using TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The energy dissipation is 93.1% lower and the cycle time is 52.4% lower than those of a deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM with a comparable area. It is also demonstrated that the proposed TCAM tolerates up to 47% variations (3s) of threshold voltages.","1522-8681","978-1-4673-5956-6","","10.1109/ASYNC.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6546172","","","CMOS integrated circuits;content-addressable storage;delays;security of data","NIDS;QDI word circuit;TSMC CMOS technology;bundled-data techniques;deep-pipelined synchronous TCAM;delay variations;energy dissipation;low-energy variation-tolerant asynchronous TCAM;network intrusion detection systems;packet payload detection;packet traces;search delay time;size 65 nm;ternary content-addressable memory;virus detection probability","","3","","28","","","19-22 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are responsible for the management and monitoring of substations and field devices. In this paper, we investigate the use of SDN as an approach to assist in the modernization of SCADA systems. We discuss its possible benefits, such as simplified management of power system resources. Moreover, SDN can facilitate the creation of new network applications that previously, with traditional networks, were more complex to be implemented. To illustrate the benefits of the use of SDN in SCADA, we designed a mechanism that aims to prevent a possible eavesdropper from fully capturing communication flows between SCADA components. The mechanism was implemented as an SDN-based application for SCADA systems that uses multipath routing, which relies on SDN features to frequently modify communication routes between SCADA devices. Further, we performed an experimental evaluation to verify the impact and performance of the mechanism in the SCADA network.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140289","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140289","","Monitoring;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Routing;SCADA systems;Substations","SCADA systems;power system management;smart power grids;software defined networking;substations;telecommunication network routing","ICT;SCADA components;SCADA devices;SCADA network performance;SDN-based SCADA systems;communication flows;communication routes;electric system;electricity distribution;electricity transmission;field devices;information and communication technology;multipath routing;network applications;power grids;power system resources management;smart grids;software-defined networking;substations management;substations monitoring;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","31","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A self-adaptive approach that integrates monitoring, analyzing, and actuation functionalities has the potential to accommodate to a dynamically changing environment. The main objective of this paper is to develop an architecture-based self-adaptive framework to improve performance and resource efficiency of a server while maintaining reliable services. The target problem is distributed and concurrent systems. This paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Framework for Concurrency Architecture (SAFCA) that includes multiple concurrency architectural patterns or alternatives. The framework has monitoring and managing capabilities that can invoke another architectural alternative at run-time to cope with increasing demands or for reliability purpose. Two control mechanisms have been developed: SAFCA-Q and SAFCA-R. With SAFCA-Q, the system does not need to be statically configured for the highest workloads; hence, resource usage becomes more efficient in normal conditions and the system still is able to handle busty demands. SAFCA-R is used to improve reliability in the case of a failure by conducting a switchover to another software architecture. Experiment results demonstrate that the performance of SAFCA-Q is better than systems using only standalone concurrency architecture and resources are also better utilized. SAFCA-R also shows fast recovery in the face of a failure.","0730-3157","978-1-4244-7512-4","978-0-7695-4085-6","10.1109/COMPSAC.2010.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676339","autonomic computing;distributed and concurrent architecture;performance;reliability;software architecture","Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Lead;Monitoring;Reliability;Servers","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;software architecture;software maintenance;software performance evaluation;software reliability","SAFCA-Q;SAFCA-R;architecture based selfadaptive framework;computer system;concurrency architectural pattern;distributed service computing;distributed system;dynamically changing environment;reliable service maintainance;resource efficiency;resource usage;software architecture;software performance;software reliability","","0","","18","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS","","0-7695-2549-0","","10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271","IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network","","3","","16","","","29-29 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the surface, this should greatly reduce the chances of successfully executing the type of coordinated and distributed cyber attacks necessary to cause large-scale failures. However, existing communications security schemes in power control systems only consider explicit communications. In this paper, we show that there is a rich set of covert communication channels available to attackers for use in coordinating large scale attacks against power grids. Specifically, we present PhyCo, a novel covert channel that leverages physical substrates, e.g., line loads, within a power system, to transmit information between compromised device controllers. Using PhyCo, two compromised controllers that are miles apart can coordinate their efforts by manipulating relays to modify the power network's topology. This can be done without requiring the use of any explicit communication channels, e.g., power line communications, and can evade intrusion detection sensors aimed at overt traffic. We have evaluated PhyCo using real-world programmable logic controllers on a realistic simulated power grid. Our results show that PhyCo can bypass existing intrusion detection sensors as well as physical inspections by carefully crafting covert communications to have minimal exterior consequences within normal operating thresholds.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007771","","Equations;Mathematical model;Power grids;Power measurement;Receivers;Sensors","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;programmable controllers","PhyCo;coordinated cyber attacks;covert channel communication;cyberphysical infrastructures;device controller;distributed cyber attacks;electric power systems;physical interdependencies;power grid;power network topology;programmable logic controller","","0","","24","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we describe a new approach to feature-based anomaly detection that constructs histograms of different traffic features, models histogram patterns, and identifies deviations from the created models. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations. Compared to previous feature-based anomaly detection approaches, our work differs by constructing detailed histogram models, rather than using coarse entropy-based distribution approximations. We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces.

In this paper, we show how a vulnerable program can be used to create a covert channel that allows an entity (e.g., an attacker) to stealthily send information to another remote entity (e.g., a backdoor). The proposed covert channel, for which we coin the term OverCovert, is based on the common return-to-libc stack-overflow attack and the address space layout randomization defense.

There needs to be an automated tool that can help diagnosing both malicious security faults and benign performance faults. It is often difficult, however, to identify the root causes since the manifesting anomalies from network measurements are highly interrelated. In this paper we present a novel approach, called <i>MOdel-based self-Diagnosis</i> (MODI), for fault detection and localization. Our solution consists of Structural and Behavioral Model (SBM) that is constructed using both <i>structural</i> causality from wireless protocol specifications and <i>behavioral</i> statistics from network measurements. We use logic-based backward reasoning to automate fault detection and localization based on SBM, by comparing observed network measurements with expected network behaviors and by tracing back causality structures. The reasoning algorithm and the model description are decoupled so a SBM model can be easily updated for varying WLAN configurations and changing network conditions. Compared to previous work, the contribution of this paper is the architecture and the algorithm of the diagnosis core, rather than the WLAN measurement techniques. We built and deployed MODI-embedded wireless APs that can detect both security attacks and troubleshoot performance problems. These MODI-enabled APs can also cooperate to diagnose cross-AP problems, such as those caused by device mobility. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based diagnosis is fast and effective with little overhead.","","978-963-9799-59-2","","10.4108/ICST.MOBIQUITOUS2009.6833","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5326395","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;MODIS;Measurement techniques;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol","fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;WLAN measurement techniques;device mobility;fault detection;fault localization;logic-based backward reasoning;malicious security faults;model-based fault diagnosis;model-based self-diagnosis;network management systems;security attacks;troubleshoot performance problems;wireless LAN;wireless protocol specifications","","3","","34","","","13-16 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposal of this work presented a Data Security Architecture (DSA) in improving the data transmission confidentiality in ad hoc networks based on multi-path routing. It utilizes the multiple paths between nodes in an ad hoc network to increase the confidentiality robustness of transmitted data. The original message to be secured is split into parts that are transmitted in multiple paths. The parted messages are encrypted on its course of transmission which improves the security to next level.

Conventional schemes place security devices (middleboxes) at a few choke points (e.g., core routers) and rely on routing policy to guarantee middlebox traversal. Coupling routing and security services together complicates operation and troubleshooting since routing and security are operated by different teams. When a data center scales, the security system needs upgrade accordingly. However, the current approaches are not flexible and incur high cost. Observing that rich computing resources are already available in data centers, we are interested in using a large number of software middleboxes to achieve scalability and cost efficiency. We present Hybrid Security Architecture (HSA), a design to decouple security services from routing and to allow the integration of hardware and software middleboxes in a complementary way. HSA is more cost-effective and flexible compared to the conventional schemes that solely use hardware middleboxes. It allows topology and routing changes with minimal impact to security services, and vice versa. In particular, HSA does not require modification to switches and routers. This paper explains the framework of HSA, describes the key techniques, presents a testbed to validate the design, and discusses future research directions.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364521","","Hardware;Middleboxes;Routing;Scalability;Security;Servers;Software","computer centres;computer network security;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","HSA;choke points;core routers;coupling routing;data center networks;guarantee middle box traversal;hybrid security architecture;multitenant data centers;place security devices;routing policy;security services;security system;software middleboxes;switches","","1","","18","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based reconfigurable architecture for feature extraction of large high-speed networks.

While this flexibility is a boon for embedded system developers, who can now rapidly prototype and deploy solutions with performance approaching custom designs, this results in a system development methodology where functionality is stitched together from a variety of ""soft IP cores,"" often provided by multiple vendors with different levels of trust. Unlike traditional software where resources are managed by an operating system, soft IP cores necessarily have very fine grain control over the underlying hardware. To address this problem, the embedded systems community requires novel security primitives which address the realities of modern reconfigurable hardware. We propose an isolation primitive, moats and drawbridges, that are built around four design properties: logical isolation, interconnect traceability, secure reconfigurable broadcast, and configuration scrubbing. Each of these is a fundamental operation with easily understood formal properties, yet maps cleanly and efficiently to a wide variety of reconfigurable devices.

RPL outperforms other wireless sensor and ad hoc routing protocols in quality of service (QoS), device management, and energy saving performance. The Rank concept in RPL serves multiple purposes, including route optimization, prevention of loops, and managing control overhead. In this paper, we analyze several different types of internal threats that are aimed at the Rank property and study their impact on the performance of the wireless sensor network. Our analysis raises the question of an RPL weakness, which is the lack of a monitoring parent in every node. In RPL, the child node only receives the parent information through control messages, but it cannot check the services that its parent provide hence it will follow a bad quality route if it has a malicious parent. Our results show that different types of the Rank attacks can be used to intentionally downgrade specific QoS parameters. This paper also reveals that attack in a high forwarding load area will have more impact on network performance than attack in other areas. The defenders can use the knowledge of such correlation between attack location and its impact to set higher security levels at particular positions by monitoring sensitive network parameters and detecting the anomalies.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2266399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525333","RPL;Rank attack;internal threat;performance;security","","Internet of Things;computer network security;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","6LoWPAN routing protocol;Internet of Things;QoS parameters;RPL;ad hoc routing protocols;communication standard;control messages;control overhead;device management;energy saving performance;high forwarding load area;lossy networks;low-power networks;quality of service;rank concept;routing protocol network topology;security levels;wireless sensor network","","2","","7","","2013-06-06","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite security issues delaying its adoption, cloud computing has already become an unstoppable force; thus, security mechanisms to ensure its secure adoption are an immediate need. Here, we focus on intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) to defend against the intruders. In this paper, we propose a Distributed, Collaborative, and Data-driven Intrusion Detection and Prevention system (DCDIDP). Its goal is to make use of the resources in the cloud and provide a holistic IDPS for all cloud service providers which collaborate with other peers in a distributed manner at different architectural levels to respond to attacks. We present the DCDIDP framework, whose infrastructure level is composed of three logical layers: network, host, and global as well as platform and software levels. Then, we review its components and discuss some existing approaches to be used for the modules in our proposed framework. Furthermore, we discuss developing a comprehensive trust management framework to support the establishment and evolution of trust among different cloud service providers.","","978-1-4673-0683-6","978-1-936968-32-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144819","Cloud computing;collaborative IDPS;distributed IDPS;intrusion detection","Computational modeling;Indium tin oxide;Load modeling;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;security of data","architectural levels;cloud computing environments;cloud service providers;distributed collaborative and data-driven intrusion detection;global layer;host layer;infrastructure level;intrusion detection and prevention systems;logical layers;network layer;platform levels;security mechanisms;software levels","","2","","28","","","15-18 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Denial of service can be of any form either ping of death or clone attack. In existing system these can be overcome using filtering technique namely blackhole and sinkhole. Filtering malicious traffic can be integrated with firewall hardware or software. Firecol act as an intrusion prevention system which prevent the network attack using IPS rules. This form a virtual mitigation shield around the network by clusters of IPS system. The above mentioned attack can be detected using honeypot, an IDS(intrusion detection system).

Using our architecture we conduct a series of tests. We indicate that our UDAs can elevate millisecond-scale running time of current proposals to nanosecond-scale (including proposals from northbound applications of SDN community and virtual appliances of Network Function Virtualization or NFV community). Also, regarding ease of programmability, we show that our proposal decrease the lines of code of by 72.9% and 79.3% compared to implementing the same functionality as a northbound application and as a standalone middlebox, respectively.

It is desirable to have a development and testing environment that can automate this process. In this paper, we propose a software framework for such an environment and describe a system implementation in the secure MANET routing domain. This environment includes the following three major features. First, the environment is built upon a wireless network emulation tool to support repeatable experimentation. Second, it adds an attack emulation layer with necessary API for easy development and execution of attack test cases. Third, the extensible attack library includes a full set of basic attacks at its core and a way to compose complex attacks from the atomic elements. To demonstrate the usefulness of this tool, we show the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a case study. Our successful experience confirms that the platform can greatly facilitate the development of security solutions on MANET.","","0-7695-2369-2","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607590","","Atomic layer deposition;Automatic testing;Emulation;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;System testing;Wireless networks","","","","2","","16","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, its success ratio for authentication may be not high, especially in large-scale Mobile Ad- Hoc Networks (MANETs). In order to address this issue, we propose a hybrid authentication scheme which integrates the chained authentication with the distributed authentication. When a node can't find enough authentication nodes in its one-hop neighborhood to authenticate itself it requests its neighboring nodes to find a certificate chain to do so through the chained authentication. Hence, our scheme overcomes the drawbacks in terms of success ratio for authentication. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies show that, compared with the chained authentication schemes, our scheme is more scalable and it can increase the success ratio for authentication, without sacrificing the security requirement.","","978-0-7695-2983-7","","10.1109/CIT.2007.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4385175","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer networks;Computer science;Cryptography;Information technology;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network servers;Public key;Scalability","ad hoc networks;message authentication;mobile radio;telecommunication security","chained authentication scheme;distributed authentication scheme;mobile ad-hoc network;trust establishment scheme","","3","","11","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We construct Cloaker, a proof-of-concept rootkit for the ARM platform that is non- persistent and only relies on hardware state modifications for concealment and operation. A primary goal in the design of Cloaker is to not alter any part of the host operating system (OS) code or data, thereby achieving immunity to all existing rootkit detection techniques which perform integrity, behavior and signature checks of the host OS. Cloaker also demonstrates that a self-contained execution environment for malicious code can be provided without relying on the host OS for any services. Integrity checks of hardware state in each of the machine's devices are required in order to detect rootkits such as Cloaker. We present a framework for the Linux kernel that incorporates integrity checks of hardware state performed by device drivers in order to counter the threat posed by rootkits such as Cloaker.","1081-6011","978-0-7695-3168-7","","10.1109/SP.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531160","ARM;operating system;rootkit;security","Computer science;Computer security;Counting circuits;Hardware;Immune system;Kernel;Mobile handsets;Operating systems;Privacy;Virtual machining","Linux;security of data","Cloaker;Linux kernel;device drivers;hardware state modifications;hardware supported rootkit concealment;malicious attackers;rootkit detection techniques;system defenders","","5","","57","","","18-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a compiler-based solution to the notorious buffer overflow attack problem. Using this solution, users can prevent attackers from compromising their systems by changing the return address to execute injected code, which is the most common method used in buffer overflow attacks. Return address defender (RAD) is a simple compiler patch that automatically creates a safe area to store a copy of return addresses and automatically adds protection code into applications that it compiles to defend programs against buffer overflow attacks. Using it to protect a program does not need to modify the source code of the protected programs. Moreover, RAD does not change the layout of stack frames, so binary code it generated is compatible with existing libraries and other object files. Empirical performance measurements on a fully operational RAD prototype show that programs protected by RAD only experience a factor of between 1.01 to 1.31 slow-down. In this paper we present the principle of buffer overflow attacks, a taxonomy of defense methods, the implementation details of RAD, and the performance analysis of the RAD prototype","","0-7695-1077-9","","10.1109/ICDSC.2001.918971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918971","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Computer networks;Computer security;Libraries;Measurement;Program processors;Protection;Prototypes;Taxonomy","program compilers;security of data","RAD;arbitrary programs;binary code;buffer overflow attacks;compile-time solution;compiler patch;network-attached computer system;return address defender;security;stack frames","","37","6","26","","","Apr 2001","16 Apr 2001-19 Apr 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there is no central controller such as router to determine the communication paths in MANET, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. However, it is hard to encourage cooperativeness among nodes for each node owns limited resources that need to be preserved. These particular nodes which are also known as selfish nodes refuse to help other nodes in forwarding packets due to the anxiety of having resource degradation such as exhausted battery power and limited processor capability. This problem has aroused several issues in MANET: routing, security, quality of service (QoS), resource management and auto-configuration. Hence, there is a need to provide a mechanism that can encourage cooperation among nodes without jeopardizing their resources. In this paper, we provide evidence through simulation experiments on how a friendship concept could be used to minimize the number of false alarms raised in MANET intrusion detection system (IDS).
