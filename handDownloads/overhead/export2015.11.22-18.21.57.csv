In this paper we explore the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for such a purpose. Although GP has already been studied for this task, the inner features of network intrusion detection have been systematically ignored. To avoid the blind use of GP shown in previous research, we guide the search by means of a fitness function based on recent advances on IDS evaluation. For the experimental work we use a well-known dataset (i.e. KDD-99) that has become a standard to compare research although its drawbacks. Results clearly show that an intelligent use of GP achieves systems that are comparable (and even better in realistic conditions) to top state-of-the-art proposals in terms of effectiveness, improving them in efficiency and simplicity.","","978-1-4244-5879-0","","10.1109/ARES.2010.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438073","effectiveness;efficiency;genetic programming;intrusion detection","Availability;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Telecommunication traffic","genetic algorithms;security of data","domain-aware genetic programming;fitness function;intrusive traffic;network intrusion detection;normal traffic","","2","","22","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942","Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort","Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data","MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component","","0","","19","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, we analyze some existing cloud based intrusion detection systems with respect to their various types, positioning, detection time, detection techniques, data source and attacks. The analysis also provides limitations of each technique to determine whether they fulfill the security needs of cloud computing environment or not.

In an effort to solve this problem, researchers have explored different methods of visualizing network security threats. There is little debate that humans can perceive more information visually than textually. The problem is that the majority of visualization tools in practice or proposed do not take efficient visualization techniques into consideration. As a result, it is difficult to get a high-level view of the network that facilitates rapid isolation of network attacks. We propose the Converged Security Visualization Tool (Cover-VT) to solve the efficient visualization problem. Cover-VT was designed to provide analysts with a high-level view of network threats using geographic information systems. The tool allows for rapid identification of threats by minimizing the cognitive obstacles to efficient threat location. Cover-VT includes the capability to drill-down on a node of interest for additional details and even filter out unwanted data. Cover-VT was designed with usability in mind, making it easy to comprehend while assisting the analyst in rapid threat identification. Many different security tools make up a security analyst's tool kit. Cover-VT was developed as an effective security visualization system that integrates existing security tools and network security systems.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990663","Converged Security;Security Management;Visualization","Fires;Monitoring;Visualization","data visualisation;geographic information systems;information networks;security of data","Cover-VT;converged security visualization tool;geographic information systems;network attacks;network security systems;network security threats;rapid threat identification;security analysts;threat location","","0","","16","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Prevention techniques lead to different models, each suitable for a single type of misbehavior, but do not guarantee the protection of a system from a more general DoS attack. We analyze the fundamental requirements to be satisfied in order to protect hosts and routers from any form of distributed DoS (DDoS). Then we propose a network signaling protocol, named active security protocol(ASP), which satisfies most of the defined requirements.

Although the session hijacking is not in the forefront of everyone mind, it still remains a commonly used attack in MANET. Session hijack attacks are defined as taking over an active TCP/IP communication session without their permission or knowledge. When implemented successfully, attackers assume the identity of the compromised user, enjoying the same access to resources as the compromised user. Network protocols like FTP, Telnet, and rlogin are especially attractive to the attacker, because of the session oriented nature of their connections, and lack of implementation of any security during login, authentication, or data transmission. We introduce a novel method for defending session hijacking attack in MANET: Pseudo Random Alteration of Sequence Numbers (PRAS). Based on the comprehensive evaluation based on simulations, it is shown that PRAS can successfully defend session hijacking under diverse mobile multi-hop network environment with low communication, computation, and memory overhead.","","","","10.1109/ICCT.2013.6820344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820344","Mobile Ad hoc Networks;Sequence number;Session hijacking;TCP attacks","Ad hoc networks;Computer crime;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Receivers;Servers","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;random sequences;telecommunication security;transport protocols","FTP;MANET;PRAS;TCP-IP communication session;Telnet;authentication;data transmission;diverse mobile multihop network environment;mobile ad hoc network;network protocol;pseudorandom alteration of sequence number;rlogin;security;session hijacking attack","","1","","14","","","17-19 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately layerl-aware NIDS/NIPSs pose crucial implementation issues because they require full TCP/IP reassembly without losing (1) complete prevention, (2) performance, (3) application transparency, or (4) transport transparency. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches meet all of these requirements. Our store-through does this by forwarding each out-of-order or IP-fragmented packet immediately after copying it even if it has not been checked yet. Although the forwarded packet might turn out to be a part of an attack, the store-through can successfully defend against the attack by blocking one of the subsequent packets. Testing of a prototype in linux kernel 2.4.30 demonstrated that the overhead of our mechanism is negligible compared with that of a simple IP forwarder even with the presence of out-of-order packets.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-1520-5","978-1-4244-1521-2","10.1109/ISCC.2007.4381605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381605","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Out of order;Protocols;Prototypes;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","IP networks;security of data;transport protocols","IP-fragmented packet;Linux kernel;TCP reassembler mechanism;application transparency;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;transport transparency","","2","","25","","","1-4 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enhance security in <i>ad hoc</i> networks, it is important to evaluate the trustworthiness of other nodes without central authorities. An information-theoretic framework is presented, to quantitatively measure trust and build a novel trust model (FAPtrust) with multiple trust decision factors. These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems.

However, less success has been encountered in mapping data intensive irregular applications such as graph analytics, relational databases, and machine learning. Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks. Experiments with a set of irregular data intensive CUDA applications executing on a cycle-level simulator show that DTBL achieves average 1.21x speedup over the original flat implementation and average 1.40x over the implementation with device-side kernel launches using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism.","","","","10.1145/2749469.2750393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284092","","Cognition;Context;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Organizations;Registers","graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming","1D-3D grid;BSP programming languages;CUDA dynamic parallelism;DTBL;GPU execution model;bulk synchronous parallel programming languages;cycle-level simulator;data intensive irregular applications;dynamic thread block launch;irregular data intensive CUDA applications;lightweight execution mechanism;lightweight thread block dynamic spawning;nested device-side kernel launching functionality","","","","","","","13-17 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host. In this paper, we propose VMCoupler for enabling co-migration of offloaded IDSes and their target VM. Our approach is running offloaded IDSes in a special VM called a guard VM, which can monitor the internals of the target VM using VM introspection. VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination. The migration processes of these two VMs are synchronized so that the target VM does not run without being monitored. We have confirmed that the overheads of kernel monitoring and co-migration were small.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2013.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753786","IaaS clouds;intrusion detection systems;migration;virtual machines","Bridges;Linux;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Ports (Computers);Switches;Synchronization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS offloading;IDSes;IaaS clouds;VM introspection;VMCoupler;guard VM;infrastructure-as-a-service;intrusion detection system;kernel monitoring;synchronized comigration;virtual machine","","2","","19","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the extraction of flow features is difficult due to the increasing line rates, a broad range of network protocols, and a variety of complex flow features. In this paper, we leverage the multi-core processors to speed up the feature extraction process. We design an open source parallel software tool, aiming for processing network packet flows in real-time. We implement the software in four different designs including serial, parallel, pipelined and hybrid architectures. We evaluate the performance of the parallel software tool through measurement experiments.

Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D<sup>2</sup>FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the content addressed delayed input DFA (CD<sup>2</sup>FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD<sup>2</sup>FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a ""content-less"" identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput. Specifically, we show that for an application using thousands of patterns defined by regular expressions, CD<sup>2</sup>FAs use as little as 10% of the space required by a conventional compressed DFA, and match the throughput of an uncompressed DFA.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579526","DFA;deep packet inspection;regular expressions","Added delay;Automata;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Information security;Inspection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Permission;Throughput","computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;grammars;storage management","content addressed delayed input;content addressing;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;expression representation;memory access;network applications;network data streams;regular expression parsing;state traversal process;table compression","","15","2","34","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, a large-scale simultaneous attack on smart meters to destabilize the grid could be feasible via cyber means, which is not viable via physical attacks alone. The interactions between the providers and attackers of the smart grid and their optimal strategies can be modeled as a Markov game. However, the computational complexity of such a game grows exponentially with the size of the infrastructure, making it impractical for smart grids of reasonable sizes. In this paper, we show that when the players' current interest is a subset of the states only and they are willing to accept small inaccuracies in the game solutions, many Markov game states can be pruned. We present a pruning algorithm in which a threshold parameter is used to control qualitatively the tradeoff between computation time and solution accuracy. The algorithm is iterative with decoupled state values in each iteration, and we parallelize the state estimations to reduce the overall computation time. We illustrate with examples that the pruning algorithm reduces the computation time greatly without losing much precision in the game solutions, and that parallelization further reduces the computation time.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2223243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6457437","Markov games;power system security;smart grid communication networks","Communication networks;Computer crime;Game theory;Games;Markov processes;Smart grids","Markov processes;computational complexity;game theory;iterative methods;power engineering computing;power system protection;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart meters;smart power grids","Markov games;computational complexity;cyber attacks;cyber component proliferation;decoupled state values;information collection;iterative algorithm;large-scale simultaneous attack;operation control;optimal strategy;pruning algorithm;smart grid attackers;smart grid infrastructure protection;smart grid providers;smart meters;state estimations;threshold parameter","","2","","32","","2013-02-07","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The sheer volume of the data prohibits efficient detection from a pure algorithmic approach. However timely detection of such sophisticated scanning attacks is critical since the attacker employing these approaches is usually well-resourced and potentially can bring high impact to the network than a naive attacker can. To detect such sophisticated scans we propose the integration of algorithmic detection and visualization for human detection to simultaneously optimize computational complexity and human analyst time. The proposed approach provides real world detection capabilities without excessive computation overhead. We characterize the features of scanning attacks in a graph theory context, propose efficient graph algorithms to extract these features in real time, employ visualization techniques to show the relevant multidimensional characteristics, and provide test scenarios to show that the proposed work is more efficient and effective than previous approaches.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654827","","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Feature extraction;IP networks;Ports (Computers);Probes;Visualization","computer network security;graph theory","graph theory;sophisticated scanning attack;sophisticated stealthy network;visualization technique","","0","","9","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.","","","","10.1109/SRDS.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400","Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication","Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery","ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services","","0","","40","","","6-9 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This knowledge is provided by network mapping tools. These tools rely on models to represent the entities of interest, and they leverage off network discovery techniques to populate the model structure with the data that is pertinent to a specific target network. Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit. The modeled information is managed by using a suite of composable network tools that can determine various aspects of network configurations through scanning techniques and heuristics.

In this paper we propose a lightweight protocol called DICAS that mitigates these attacks by detecting, diagnosing, and isolating the malicious nodes. DICAS uses as a fundamental building block the ability of a node to oversee its neighboring nodes communication. On top of DICAS, we build a secure routing protocol, LSR, which in addition supports multiple node-disjoint paths. We analyze the security guarantees of DICAS and use ns-2 simulations to show its effectiveness against three representative attacks.

In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the ""detection manager"" to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks that contain malicious nodes indicate that unobtrusive monitoring has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate.","","0-7803-8104-1","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292276","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Fault detection;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","detection manager;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;security attacks;unobtrusive monitoring technique","","3","1","18","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes. Evaluation results show that a benign majority of nodes prevail over malicious attacking nodes as they are able to accurately classify network nodes based on reputation estimations.","","978-1-4244-4155-6","978-0-7695-3649-1","10.1109/CNSR.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4939153","Computer Network Security;Cooperative Systems;Mobile Communication","Communication networks;Communication system security;Computer graphics;Cryptography;Data security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Uncertainty","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","cooperative intrusion detection;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;network nodes;network reliability;network security;reputation exchange;trust evaluation","","5","","17","","","11-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a novel exploration in addressing these problems from a survivable, inescapable and deployable point of view.","","978-1-4244-8335-8","978-0-7695-4214-0","10.1109/HPCC.2010.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587281","Alert fusion;Cache-based mechanism;Target oriented policy","","security of data;sensor fusion","Australian Honey-Pot;CAFS scheme;alert fusion mechanism;cache-based alert fusion scheme;intrusion alert fusion system;intrusion detection system","","4","","28","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.

In this paper we propose two schemes for key management in clustered sensor networks with changing cluster head. In Simple Secure Logical Ring (SSLR) scheme communication and computation cost incurred for key establishment is constant. Whereas in Burmester Desmedt Logical Ring (BDLR) scheme key establishment is achieved by performing (n + 1) multiplications and (n+ 5) communications, where n is the number of nodes in the cluster.

Data plane forwarding in network routers has traditionally been implemented with custom-logic hardware, but recent router designs increasingly use software-programmable network processors for packet forwarding. These general-purpose processing devices exhibit software vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. We demonstrate-to our knowledge the first-practical attack that exploits a vulnerability in packet processing software to launch a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network infrastructure. This attack uses only a single attack packet to consume the full link bandwidth of the router's outgoing link. We also present a hardware-based defense mechanism that can detect situations where malicious packets try to change the operation of the network processor. Using a hardware monitor, our NetFPGA-based prototype system checks every instruction executed by the network processor and can detect deviations from correct processing within four clock cycles. A recovery system can restore the network processor to a safe state within six cycles. This high-speed detection and recovery system can ensure that network processors can be protected effectively and efficiently from this new class of attacks.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231636","Network security;embedded system security;network attack;network processor;processing monitor;programmable router","Computer crime;Embedded systems;Internet;Network security;Program processors;Routing protocols","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;logic devices","NetFPGA;computer networks;control plane;custom-logic hardware;data plane;denial-of-service attack;hardware-based defense mechanism;network routers;packet forwarding;packet processing software;security issues;software vulnerabilities;software-programmable network processors","","4","","40","","2012-07-03","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SCAMPI is designed with a memory-centric model of complexity in mind, to minimize memory traffic and enhance data reuse with a careful compile-time data layout. The experimental evaluation executed on two families of multicore processors, Cell B.E and Intel Xeon E5472, shows that it is possible to obtain a processing rate of more than 2 Gbits/sec per core with very large dictionaries and heavy hitting rates. In the largest tested configuration, SCAMPI reaches 16 Gbits/sec on 8 Xeon cores, reaching, and in some cases exceeding, the performance of special-purpose processors and FPGA. Using SCAMPI we have been able to scan an input stream using a dictionary of 3.5 millions keywords, more than an order of magnitude larger than any published result in the literature and in commercial prototypes, at a rate of more than 1.2 Gbits/sec per processing core.","","","","10.1145/1654059.1654106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375524","","","multiprocessing systems;program compilers;security of data;string matching","Cell BE;Intel Xeon E5472;SCAMPI;Xeon core;algorithmic design;compile-time data layout;data reuse;dictionary;ground-breaking string searching algorithm;hitting rate;memory traffic;memory-centric model;multicore processor;network intrusion detection system;network rate;pattern inspection;processing rate;scalable CAM-based algorithm;string matching","","1","","23","","","14-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently model-based qualitative evaluation has been used for the evaluation of security protocols to quantify security properties in terms of intrusion tolerance using quantitative modeling techniques. However, most of the prior work focused only on measuring security properties, largely ignoring the performance impact of the security mechanisms introduced into the system. In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting. In particular, we analyze how often the IDS should perform intrusion detection to effectively trade security off for performance, or vice versa, for the system to satisfy the application security and performance requirements. Given the mean time to security failure (MTTSF) for the system to reach a failure state, and the response time per rekey operation for the wireless group communicating system as metrics, we identify the optimal intrusion detection rate under which the MTTSF metric can be best traded off for the response time metric.","","0-7803-9427-5","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532047","","Area measurement;Availability;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","radio networks;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;model-based qualitative evaluation;security mechanisms;wireless group communicating systems;wireless networks","","1","","16","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a method to search for arbitrary regular expressions by scanning multiple bytes in parallel using speculation. We break the packet in several chunks, opportunistically scan them in parallel, and if the speculation is wrong, correct it later.

However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","","978-1-4244-5113-5","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing. The system uses sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms. The developed system is applied to different probing attacks.

In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.","","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971","Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing","Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority","","1","","18","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems.

To handle a large number of flows, the architecture should support a mechanism to perform rapid context switch without adversely affecting the throughput. As the number of flows increases, large-capacity memory is needed to store per flow states of the matching. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated context switch mechanism for managing a large number of states on memory efficiently. With sufficiently large off-chip memory, a state-of-the-art FPGA device can be multiplexed by millions of packet flows with negligible throughput degradation for large-size packets.

The IDSaaS can be roughly classified into two types: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison.

The particular experiment described here explored one aspect of the IA program's grand hypothesis of dynamic defense: “Dynamic modification of defensive structure improves system assurance.” This experiment concentrated on the assertion that autonomic response mechanisms can improve overall system assurance by thwarting an attack while it is underway. In most cases, each attack in this experiment was run first with only “prevent and detect” mechanisms enabled, then repeated with “prevent, detect, and respond mechanisms” enabled. The key result of this experiment is that the hypothesis was supported","1083-4427","","","10.1109/3468.935052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935052","","Air transportation;Computer networks;Computer security;Control systems;Information security;Information systems;Intelligent structures;Power system protection;Research and development;Testing","command and control systems;computer crime;computer networks;telecommunication security","DARPA Information Assurance Program;autonomic response mechanisms;defensive structure;detect mechanism;dynamic defense experiment;foreign national intelligence agency;prevent mechanism;respond mechanism;strategic cyberdefense;system assurance","","12","7","32","","","Jul 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. Our starting point in this paper is an overall strategy for network resilience, which draws on existing or under development mechanisms, that can be used to maintain acceptable levels of operation in the event of challenges. A crucial part of this strategy is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a new approach to challenge identification that goes beyond current techniques for attack, anomaly or fault detection. We describe our proposed approach in the context of known network challenge scenarios and identify the gaps in the state of the art that our work is filling. We indicate its validity by showing how it can address the challenge of interference in wireless mesh networks.","","978-1-4244-8167-5","978-1-4244-8166-8","10.1109/NGI.2010.5534459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5534459","","Computer networks;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Filling;IP networks;Information technology;Interference;Resilience;Web and internet services;Wireless mesh networks","Internet;computer network security;interference;wireless mesh networks","Internet;accidental faults;challenge identification;fault detection;malicious attacks;network resilience;operational overloads;wireless mesh network interference","","8","","34","","","2-4 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea of the SBAC is based on the observation that if the routers have information about the services that are running on the end host and can identify the upper layer traffic from the IP packet payload, then it becomes easy to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic for that particular victim server. To minimise the overhead on the routers, the SBAC model is invoked during the attack times only and the victimpsilas traffic is processed separately. The boundary routers in SBAC model validate each incoming packet to the victim on a per server basis. Only the packets that are considered to be accessing the legitimate services are passed and the remaining packets are dropped. Hence, at this stage the victimpsilas network is immune to any dynamic changes in attack pattern if the attack packets are not accessing the legitimate services at the victim end. The packets that are considered to be accessing legitimate services of the victim machine/network are marked with a unique ID and destined to the victim. If any of the received packets are found to be malicious, the unique ID enables the victim to identify service specific attack signature for each ingress SBAC router and prevent the attack traffic at that particular router. We will also discuss how the SBAC model deals with attacks on the infrastructure of the autonomous system.","","978-0-7695-3702-3","","10.1109/ICECCS.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5090528","Access control;Autonomous System;Denial of Service;Traceback","Access control;Computer crime;Computer network management;Filtering;Information security;Intrusion detection;Reflection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;authorisation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","DDoS attack;IP packet payload;Internet;SBAC router model;autonomous system;distributed denial of service attack;legitimate service;malicious attack traffic;service-based access control model","","4","","30","","","2-4 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing popularity and rising demand for more public Wi-Fi hotspots, network service providers are facing a daunting task. Wi-Fi hotspots typically require extensive wired infrastructure to access the backhaul network, which is often expensive and time consuming to provide in such situations. wireless mesh networks (WMNs) offer an easy and economical alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity and could be called the web-in-the-sky. In place of an underlying wired backbone, a WMN forms a wireless backhaul network, thus obviating the need for extensive cabling. They are based on multihop communication paradigms that dynamically form a connected network. However, multihop wireless communication is severely plagued by many limitations such as low throughput and limited capacity. In this article we point out key challenges that are impeding the rapid progress of this upcoming technology. We systematically examine each layer of the network and discuss the feasibility of some state-of-the-art technologies/protocols for adequately addressing these challenges.

The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the problem of dropping Routing Traffic attack by applying multiple selfish nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) technique to identify the selfish nodes in the ad hoc network. An AODV-based REHIDAN technique is presented to take the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the dropping traffic attack and after applying the developed HIDS is measured. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN technique reduces the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","1110-6980","978-1-4244-4214-0","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233983","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized administration;dynamic network topology;mobile ad hoc network;multiple selfish nodes;network infrastructure;network performance;optimized network engineering tools;real-time host intrusion detection;routing protocol;routing traffic attack;secure protocol;simulated environment;wireless ad hoc AODV;wireless nodes","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe peer intermediaries for key establishment (PIKE), a class of key-establishment protocols that involves using one or more sensor nodes as a trusted intermediary to facilitate key establishment.

We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic.

Their main drawback is that they are more exposed to cyber-attack as data packets have to be relayed on a hop-by-hop basis. This paper presents a dynamically updating key distribution strategy, together with a message protection scheme in support of 4-way handshaking. For the 4-way handshaking, we propose a hash based encryption scheme to secure the unprotected message exchanges during the handshaking process. This is aimed at improving the resiliency of the network in the situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack.

The proposed protocol is efficient in terms of communication overhead as it reduces the number and the size of rekeying messages. It is efficient in terms of computation overhead as it guarantees the necessary level of confidentiality and authenticity of rekeying messages by only using symmetric ciphers and one-way hash functions.

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.","","978-0-7695-3347-6","","10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314","Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","Internet;information retrieval;security of data","Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet","","3","","33","","","21-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as “safe” or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic “in the dark”.","","978-1-4577-1481-8","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529","Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;IPv6;Network Flow Classification;Service Providers;VPN","Encryption;IP networks;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;cryptography;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","IP tunneling;data packet opaque;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;next generation service provider network;opaque traffic classification;quality of service system;traffic flow management","","0","","19","","","15-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proliferation of heterogeneous computer networks provides additional implications for the intrusion detection problem. The increased connectivity of computer systems gives greater access to outsiders, and makes it easier for intruders to escape from detection. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from a legitimate user. An intrusion detection system (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts the system or network administrator. It detects and identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems from both the system insiders and external penetrators. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are becoming essential components in a secure network environment, allowing for early detection of malicious activities and attacks. By employing information provided by IDS, it is possible to apply appropriate countermeasures techniques and mitigate attacks that would otherwise seriously undermine network security. In this paper we are proposing a techniques, which maintain the small distributed signature database and dynamically update it based on the change in network environment. Overall objective of the research work is to improve the efficiency and self configurability of the IDS in a dynamic and changing environment.","","978-1-4799-6928-9","","10.1109/CICN.2014.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065647","Intrusion Detection System;SNORT;Signature Database","Classification algorithms;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Intrusion detection;distributed signature database;heterogeneous computer network;network traffic;self tuning IDS","","0","","21","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Zombie detection is currently performed at the host and/or network levels, but these options have important drawbacks: antivirus, firewalls and anti-spyware are not effective against this threat because they are not able to detect hosts that are compromised via new or target specific malicious software and were not designed to protect the network from external attacks or vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new botnet detection approach based on the identification of traffic patterns: since each network application, whether it is licit or illicit, has a characteristic traffic pattern that can uniquely identify it, the detection framework will rely on an Artificial Neural Network to identify the licit and illicit patterns. After the identification phase, the system will generate alarms to the system administrator, that can trigger the most appropriate security actions, like blocking the corresponding IP addresses, putting them under a deeper surveillance or acting over some suspicious network segment. A general detection framework was developed in order to incorporate the detection methodology itself, as well as the data collection and storage modules and all the necessary management functions. Some performance tests were already carried out on the proposed system and the results obtained show that the system is stable and fast and the detection approach is efficient, since it provides high detection rates with low computational overhead.","","978-1-4244-7271-0","","10.1109/ICDT.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532380","Botnet;intrusion detection;neural network;traffic profile","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Data security;Local area networks;Neural networks;Protection;Software performance;Surveillance;System testing;Telecommunication traffic","","","","3","","20","","","13-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researchers and enterprises have already done a lot to optimize the identity management and strengthen the security in cloud computing. Most of these studies focus on the usability of identity management and various kinds of method to help improve security. But in this paper, we do some research from a new angle. While the federated solution of identity management helps relieve many problems, it's adopted by many platforms and enterprises. The general approach for deploying identity management is a centralized component processing authentication and authorization requests. But with the cloud growing in scale and the increasing number of users, this centralized solution will be the bottleneck of the cloud. In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach for implementing identity management in service oriented architecture in cloud computing and a grouping algorithm as the deploy strategy. Security is another problem involved in this paper.
