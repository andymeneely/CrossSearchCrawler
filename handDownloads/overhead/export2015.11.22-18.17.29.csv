The security of wireless sensor networks is a big concern. Hence for secure communication it is important to detect and prevent the attacks in network. Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network. Security algorithm for wireless sensor networks such as CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is used for secure communication. The CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is an advanced cryptography method which is used for encryption and decryption process to provide special security. This paper focuses on strong security by detecting and preventing attacks, also ensures data authentication, integrity of data and solves less power transmission of data and receiver collision problem, by deploying hybrid mechanism.","","","","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164714","AODV;CAWS;EAACK;MES-1;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor network","Communication system security;Encryption;Intrusion detection;Standards;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV scheme;CAWS;EAACK mechanism;MES-1;ad hoc on demand distance vector scheme;attack prevention;black-hole attack detection;cryptography method;data authentication;data integrity;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;gray-hole attack detection;intrusion detection system;modern encryption standard;receiver collision problem;wireless sensor network security","","0","","17","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These Networks are used in many applications in military, ecological, and health-related areas. These applications often include the monitoring of sensitive information therefore security is important in WSNs. Routing attacks can have devastating effect on wireless Sensor Network and present a major challenge when designing security mechanisms. Sinkhole attack is the most destructive routing attack for these networks, it enable many other attack. In this type of attack sinkhole node tries to attract data to itself by convincing neighbors through broadcasting fake routing information. This paper present an AODV based secure routing algorithm based on mobile agent for detecting the malicious node in sinkhole attack. The algorithm detects sinkhole node by finding the difference of nodes sequence numbers using threshold value. It also shows performance evaluation of AODV with the enhanced secure routing algorithm and existing secure routing algorithm through simulations, which confirmed the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm by considering performance metrics as Throughput, PDR and Packet loss. Simulation is carried out using simulator NS2.","","978-1-4799-6084-2","","10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7226170","AODV;Mobile Agent;Sinkhole Attack;Threshold Value;Wireless sensor Networks","Cryptography;Mobile agents;Routing;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV based secure routing algorithm;NS2 simulator;destructive routing attack;fake routing information;malicious node detection;mobile agent;packet loss;performance evaluation;performance metrics;security mechanisms;wireless sensor networks","","0","","13","","","5-7 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose a cross-layer based routing attack detection system for ad hoc networks. Previous work that uses mostly audit trails collected from the routing protocol suffers from inadequacy of features to construct a reliable model for detecting anomalous routing behavior. On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CRADS is far superior than conventional protocol-specific detection systems.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-1997-5","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489304","","Ad hoc networks;Communications Society;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cross layer design;Data security;Detectors;Multimedia systems;Routing protocols;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security","CRADS;MANET;ad hoc networks;anomalous routing behavior detection;cross layer routing attack detection systems;cross-layer based routing attack detection system;data reduction;integrated cross layer;linear detectors;multiple protocols;nonlinear detector;nonlinear nature;routing protocol;support vector machine","","5","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose Bloom-1, a new data structure that performs membership check in one memory access, which compares favorably with the k memory accesses of a classical Bloom filter. We also generalize Bloom-1 to Bloom-g, allowing performance tradeoff between membership query overhead and false positive ratio. We thoroughly examine the variants in this new family of filters, and show that they can be configured to outperform the Bloom filters with a smaller number of memory accesses, a smaller or equal number of hash bits, and a smaller and comparable false positive ratio in practical scenarios.

To address this issue, we introduce a specification-based intrusion detection sensor that can be deployed in the field to identify security threats in real time. This sensor monitors the traffic among meters and access points at the network, transport, and application layers to ensure that devices are running in a secure state and their operations respect a specified security policy. It does this by implementing a set of constraints on transmissions made using the C12.22 standard protocol that ensure that all violations of the specified security policy will be detected. The soundness of these constraints was verified using a formal framework, and a prototype implementation of the sensor was evaluated with realistic AMI network traffic.","","978-1-4577-2005-5","978-0-7695-4590-5","10.1109/PRDC.2011.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133080","AMI;formal method;intrusion detection;specification-based security","Authentication;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Reliability;Timing","automatic meter reading;computer network security;formal specification;power distribution reliability;power meters;power system measurement;power system security;sensors;smart power grids;transport protocols","AMI network traffic;C12.22 standard protocol;access points;advanced metering infrastructure;energy distribution infrastructure reliability;innovative situational awareness solutions;modernized power grid security;security policy;security threat identify;sensor;smart meters;specification based intrusion detection;traffic monitoring","","31","","34","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explores the negative impacts of packet dropping attacks and a method to detect such attacks. First, three dropping patterns are classified and investigated. We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a “uncompromised” router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment. Third, we present a statistical analysis module for the detection of TCP packet dropping attacks. Three measures, session delay, the position and the number of packet reorderings, have been implemented in the statistical module.

Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. And practically all of them require some kind of termination in network connections. So, the quest for betterment continues.

To mitigate extra load caused by renewing of certificates, we have identified critical factors affecting it and designed the computation formula for optimal amount of cross certificates issued by trusted authority. To further improve the service reachablity in highly mobile networks in earlier stages of PKI deployment, we have designed the Cluster Glue. The Cluster Glue helps to connect groups of nodes from different parts of network which owns the certificates issued by the same authority.

The objective of key management is to dynamically establish and maintain secure channels among communicating nodes. Desired features of key management in sensor networks include energy awareness, localized impact of attacks, and scaling to a large number of nodes. A primary challenge is managing the trade-off between providing acceptable levels of security and conserving scarce resources, in particular energy, needed for network operations. Many schemes, referred to as static schemes, have adopted the principle of key predistribution with the underlying assumption of a relatively static short-lived network (node replenishments are rare, and keys outlive the network). An emerging class of schemes, dynamic key management schemes, assumes long-lived networks with more frequent addition of new nodes, thus requiring network rekeying for sustained security and survivability. In this article we present a classification of key management schemes in sensor networks delineating their similarities and differences. We also describe a novel dynamic key management scheme, localized combinatorial keying (LOCK), and compare its security and performance with a representative static key management scheme.

This unique nature introduced new challenges in the security research field such that it became imperative to design new security mechanisms that suit these characteristics. The proposed work contributes to the problem of securing data forwarding in the network layer; this is accomplished through exploiting the redundancy of multi-path routing for forwarding data packets. To maximise the possibility of successful delivery to a destination, each node generates a table with a reliability index for each of its neighbour without performing neighbourspsila monitoring; based on that reliability value, sending/receiving traffic is prioritised. This work evaluates the effectiveness of REliable and Efficient Forwarding (REEF) using the Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA), REEF-IDA; the conducted simulation shows that REEF-IDA outperforms REEF in which it increases the throughput of the network while it decreases both end-to-end delays and packet loss ratio.","","978-9927-486-02-0","978-9927-486-03-7","10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669844","Ad hoc networks;cross layering;information dispersal;mobility;network layer;packet forwarding;priority queuing;security","Data security;Dispersion;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Redundancy;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data forwarding security;end-to-end delays;information dispersal algorithm;mobile ad hoc networks;multipath routing;neighbour monitoring;packet forwarding enhancement;packet loss ratio;reliability index;reliable-efficient forwarding;security research field;sending-receiving traffic","","0","","31","","","8-10 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE","20060320","2005","","","3263","3268 Vol. 5","The current Department of Defense (DoD) satellite communications architecture relies heavily on point-to-point, circuit-based communications technology, which is an inherently inefficient use of bandwidth resources. The current Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Operations Iraqi (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF) demand a more efficient and scalable infrastructure to support warfighter transformation. To meet these emerging requirements, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) DoD teleport program office (TPO) is building an initial transformational net-centric architecture by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 with significant upgrades starling in FY 2006. The DoD teleport system provides the deployed warfighter access to the global information grid (GIG) by linking the space and ground segments through a worldwide, pre-positioned military and commercial satellite communications infrastructure. Through multiple radio frequency (RF) media (military and commercial bands), teleport provides inter-theater reach-back into the defense information systems network (DISN) and service command, control, communications, computer, and intelligence (C4I) systems, as well as intra-theater communications support for tactical users. These interfaces enable the seamless, interoperable, and secure transport of command and control (C2), intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and mission critical information supporting warfighter global operations. The TPO net-centric teleport architecture converges all the voice, video, and data requirements into a single Internet protocol (IP)-based transport system, consisting of: satellite IP-based networking modems, a ""black"" convergence router suite, and a voice over IP (VoIP) gateway for unclassified voice. This architecture, combined with the global network operations (NetOps) construct, will enable significant bandwidth efficiencies for greater reach-hack and enhanced warfighting capabilities through dynamic bandwidth allocation req- ired for advanced capabilities such as unmanned aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. As part of the Department's transformation, the teleport net-centric and circuit-based architecture will exist in parallel for some time to enable a gradual transition by the deployed warfighter. This architecture will be implemented in two phases beginning with a limited-IP design at two sites in FYO5 followed by a worldwide implementation at all DoD teleport locations. This paper highlights the implementation and intended operations of the new, net-centric teleport.","","0-7803-9393-7","","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1606159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1606159","","Bandwidth;Buildings;Circuits;Command and control systems;Information systems;Intelligent networks;Military communication;Military computing;Radio frequency;Satellite communication","IP networks;Internet telephony;bandwidth allocation;command and control systems;internetworking;military communication;modems;open systems;resource allocation;routing protocols;satellite communication;surveillance;telecommunication security;transport protocols","DISA;DISN;Defense Information Systems Agency;Department of Defense;GIG;GWOT;Global War on Terror;IP-based networking modem;ISR mission;NetOp;OEF;OIF;Operations Enduring Freedom;Operations Iraqi Freedom;TPO;VoIP gateway;bandwidth resource allocation;circuit-based communication technology;command-control system;commercial satellite communication;convergence router;defense information systems network;global information grid;global network operation;intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance;interoperability;intratheater communication;military satellite communication;multiple radio frequency;net-centric DoD teleport;teleport program office;transport security;voice over Internet protocol;warfighter transformation","","0","","","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Modern networks expand and operate at high speeds, which is why handling all network traffic without overlooking security issues is difficult for IDS that run on a single processor. In this paper, we proposed a shared memory design called Hybrid Multi-Pattern Algorithm (HMA) as extension of our previous work, multi-core based HMA.

To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node. Simulation results show that our scheme can effectively prolong the overall lifetime of IDS in MANET and balance the resource consumptions among all the nodes.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-1997-5","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489524","","Communications Society;Computer security;Design engineering;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nominations and elections;Peer to peer computing;Systems engineering and theory","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;resource allocation;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection;VCG model;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves model;mechanism design-based multileader election scheme;mobile ad hoc networks;resource consumption balancing;selfish nodes","","9","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes. Weights and thresholds are used for separating suspicious behaviours from normal ones","","0-7803-9545-X","","10.1109/AERO.2006.1655944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655944","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Paper technology","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","adaptive sinkhole detection;denial-of-services;intrusion detection;security features;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","21","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider intrusions of file systems. Existing tools, like BackTracker, help the system administrator backtrack from the detection point, which is a file with suspicious contents, to possible entry points of the intrusion by providing a graph containing dependency information between the various files and processes that could be related to the detection point. We improve such backtracking techniques by logging certain additional parameters of the file system during normal operations (real-time) and examining the logged information during the analysis phase.

The pre-hashing technique uses a hashing function to verify quickly the text against the partial patterns in the automaton, and the root-indexing technique matches multiple bytes for the root state in one single matching. A popular automaton algorithm, Aho-Corasick (AC) is chosen to be implemented by adding the two techniques; we employ these two techniques in a memory efficient version of AC namely bitmap AC. For the average-case time, our approach improves bitmap AC by 494% and 224% speedup for URL and virus patterns, respectively. Since pre-hashing and root-indexing techniques can be concurrently executed with bitmap AC in the hardware, our proposed approach has the same worst-case time as bitmap AC.","2160-0511","0-7695-2407-9","","10.1109/ASAP.2005.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540374","","Automata;Coprocessors;Filtering algorithms;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Pattern analysis;Pattern matching","automata theory;computer architecture;coprocessors;cryptography;file organisation;parallel algorithms;string matching","Aho-Corasick automaton;bitmap AC;content filtering coprocessor;hardware architecture;hashing function;parallel automaton string matching;prehashing;root-indexing","","3","","21","","","23-25 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the same motif, organizations are establishing security and survivability frameworks as an integral part of their business strategy so as to provide an acceptable quality-of-service for their clients and employees. However, the current paradigm of outsourced managed security service providers (MSSPs) is often difficult to transition to, offers little control to the organization, does not allow ldquobest of breedrdquo composition, and risks vendor lock-in due to the complexity of migrating to a different MSSP. We present MOSES (Mediated Overlay Services), an architecture for composing network security services such as anti-spam, antivirus, automated vulnerability detection and mitigation, and filtering. MOSES is roughly modeled on the web services framework. In addition to ease-of-deployment, MOSES allows for economies of scale and a reduction to the total cost of ownership. In this paper, we discuss our motivation and high-level view of such an architecture. We highlight the advantages, illuminate potential drawbacks, and discuss a broad research agenda toward realizing this vision.","","978-1-4244-2483-2","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567338","","Application software;Availability;Costs;Data security;Economies of scale;Filtering;Management training;Outsourcing;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic","Web services;information networks;security of data","Web services framework;antispam;antivirus;automated vulnerability detection;managed security service providers;mediated overlay services;network security;quality-of-service;total cost of ownership","","0","","19","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper traces the development of an information assurance (IA) architecture for Army installations. Early in 1999, as a critical initiative within the Army's Installation Information Infrastructure Architecture (I3A) project, the Army's ODISC4 Architectures Directorate undertook the task of developing an IA architecture overlay that could be applied to Army installation communications and computer network backbones. Following DoD's Defense-In-Depth philosophy and taking into account current and emerging DoD and Army IA policies, a multiorganizational team continues to develop a flexible, capabilities-based IA architecture that blends Army IA concepts with accepted best practices from the commercial world. The emerging architecture is being applied to both ATM and TCP/IP networks and is enabling the Army to tailor installation IA implementations to meet unique mission requirements. The paper describes and discusses the various policies, capabilities, techniques, and types of produces that are currently included in the architecture including firewalls, security enabled routers, and proxy servers. Some of the challenges that are facing Army networks such as electronic commerce and issues associated with malicious code are presented along with potential solutions that are currently being investigated including the use of technologies like e-mail scanning servers and virtual private networks. Key efforts and initiatives undertaken by the 13A Configuration Control Board's Information Assurance Working Group to develop the concepts, policies, and management processes that the Army will need to maintain its IA enabled networks are also included","","0-7803-6521-6","","10.1109/MILCOM.2000.904992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904992","","Best practices;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Electronic commerce;IP networks;Information systems;Network servers;Protection;Spine;TCPIP","Internet;asynchronous transfer mode;computer network management;electronic commerce;information networks;military communication;military computing;network servers;packet switching;security of data;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ATM networks;DoD;Installation Information Infrastructure Architecture;Internet;ODISC4 Architectures Directorate;TCP/IP networks;US Army;army installations;computer networks protection;e-mail scanning servers;electronic commerce;firewalls;information assurance architecture;information systems protection;malicious code;network attacks;network disruption;network management;network security;proxy servers;security enabled routers;virtual private networks","","0","","","","","2000","22 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this, traffic from an identified attacker is redirected to an alternative server where damage can be mitigated. The advantage of this system is that it blocks intrusions in a manner transparent to the attacker and allows for observation and investigation of attacks in order to enable the administrator to take appropriate action.

Due to certain issues like open structure and limited energy supply, the nodes sometimes misbehave and act in a selfish manner. 2ACK scheme used as an add-on technique on few routing protocols (e.g. DSR) to detect such misbehaviour for mitigating their adverse effect. The major limitation of this 2ACK scheme is additional routing overhead due to authenticated 2ACK packets.

Therefore a low overhead auto-reconfigurable automaton is needed that optimizes pattern matching performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic system that entails the efficient and reliable evaluation of a very large number of pattern queries on a resource constrained system under changing stress-load. Our system prototype, Morpheus, pre-computes several query pattern representations, named templates, which are then morphed into a required form during run-time. Morpheus uses templates to speed up dynamic automaton reconfiguration. Results from empirical studies confirm the benefits of our approach, with three orders of magnitude improvement achieved in the overall pattern matching performance with the help of dynamic reconfiguration.

However to perform privacy protection causes huge overhead. Thus it is a critical issue to perform the most suitable protection to decline performance consumption while provide privacy protection. In this paper, the Effective Privacy Protection Scheme (EPPS) is proposed to provide the appropriate privacy protection which is satisfying the user-demand privacy requirement and maintaining system performance simultaneously. At first, we analyze the privacy level users require and quantify security degree and performance of encryption algorithms.

This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns. This paper analyses the role of computational intelligence techniques to design adaptive and cognitive intrusion detection systems that can efficiently detect malicious network activities and proposes novel three-tier archite- ture for designing intelligent intrusion detection systems for wireless networks.","","978-1-4799-1594-1","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724156","IP address;MAC address;Pervasive computing;adaptation;attacks;computational intelligence;intrusion detection;wireless integration","Communication system security;Computational intelligence;IP networks;Internet;Security;Wireless networks","artificial intelligence;computer network security;radiocommunication;ubiquitous computing","3G based Internet communication;Amazon;Internet of Things;banks;business transactions;computational intelligence based intrusion detection systems;computing paradigm;cyber-physical computing;cybercrime;data confidentiality;eBay;malicious intrusions;malware;pervasive computing networks;shopping firms;sophisticated attacks;stock exchanges;wireless communication capability;wireless communication networks","","1","","14","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MANETs face security risks and energy consumption. However, conducting cyber attack monitoring and detection in a MANET becomes a challenging issue because of limited resources and its infrastructureless network environment. To address this issue, we develop both lossless and lossy aggregation techniques to reduce the energy cost in information transition and bandwidth consumption while preserving the desired detection accuracy. In particular, we develop two lossless aggregation techniques: compression-based and event-based aggregation and develop a lossy aggregation technique: feature-based aggregation.

Nodes in MANETs use radio signals with a finite range to communicate making it possible for any intermediate node to intercept the communication. Also the frequently changing topology, with high susceptibility to physical compromise along with the node's limitations in terms of energy resource, storage device and CPU form a tremendous challenge in providing security to MANETs. Unlike wired networks, there is no central infrastructure, which paves way for new challenges as services provided by central entities is now to be ensured by the mobile nodes in the network itself. As a result, there is no definitive form of defense and a comprehensive security solution should encompass avoidance, detection and reaction along with sought-after network performances. This paper focuses on the prevention/proactive approach of securing MANETs using NTRU (N<sup>th</sup> degree truncated polynomial ring), to secure end-to-end communication through data encryption during data transmission. NTRU is Lattice-based cryptography, which is known to be resistant to quantum attacks. We assume a clustered MANET environment i.e. the mobile nodes have an efficient cluster-based routing algorithm deployed which gives us the list of clusters available in the environment along with its cluster heads and competent routing between them. The proposed technique provides data encryption using NTRU between cluster heads.","","978-1-4799-3974-9","","10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238393","Lattice-based cryptography;Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) security;NTRU cryptosystem;efficient cluster-based routing;secure data transmission;secure message transmission","Ad hoc networks;Data communication;Encryption;Mobile computing;Polynomials","cryptography;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET topology;NTRU;Nth degree truncated polynomial ring;cluster-based routing algorithm;data encryption;lattice based secure data transmission;lattice-based cryptography;mobile ad hoc network node;radio signals;wireless communication adapter","","0","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, to distribute cooperative intrusion detection functions that take into account, simultaneously, multiple objectives. We formulate the problem of identifying the type of intrusion detection each node runs as a multi-objective optimization problem and motivate/develop a genetic algorithm to solve it.

The behaviors of business applications on cloud are constantly evolving due to technical upgrading, cloud migration as well as social outbreaks. These changes bring the challenge of detecting anomalies during the change of applications on cloud. LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm has already been proven as the most promising outlier detection method for detecting network intrusions. To improve the performance of detection, LOF needs a complete set of normal behaviors of business applications, which is usually not available in cloud computing. We present an adaptive anomaly detection scheme for cloud computing based on LOF. Our scheme learns behaviors of applications both in training and detecting phase. It is adaptive to the change during detecting. The adaptability of our scheme reduces demand of efforts on collecting training data before detecting. It also enables the ability to detect contextual anomalies.

A grand challenge in this situation is that current management is inflexible and the security resource utilization is not efficient. The flexible deployment and utilization of proper security devices at reasonable places at needed time with low management cost is extremely difficult. In this paper, we present a new concept of network security virtualization, which virtualizes security resources/functions to network administrators/users, and thus maximally utilizing existing security devices/middle-boxes. In addition, it enables security protection to desirable networks with minimal management cost. To verify this concept, we further design and implement a prototype system, NETSECVISOR, which can utilize existing pre-installed (fixed-location) security devices and leverage software-defined networking technology to virtualize network security functions. At its core, NETSECVISOR contains: 1) a simple script language to register security services and policies; 2) a set of routing algorithms to determine optimal routing paths for different security policies based on different needs; and 3) a set of security response functions/strategies to handle security incidents. We deploy NETSECVISOR in both virtual test networks and a commercial switch environment to evaluate its performance and feasibility.

However, the effects of routing attacks on multi-path routing have not been addressed. In this paper, the performance of multi-path routing under wormhole attack is studied in detail. The results show that multi-path routing is vulnerable to wormhole attacks. A simple scheme based on statistical analysis (called SAM) is proposed to detect such attacks and to identify malicious nodes. Comparing to the previous approaches (for example, using packet leash), no special requirements (such as time synchronization or GPS) are needed in the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that SAM successfully detects wormhole attacks and locates the malicious nodes in networks with different topologies and with different node transmission range. Moreover, SAM may act as a module in local detection agents in an intrusion detection system (IDS) for wireless ad hoc networks.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420257","","Ad hoc networks;Counting circuits;Electric variables measurement;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;multipath channels;routing protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;malicious node location;multipath routing;routing protocol;statistical analysis;wireless ad hoc network;wormhole attack detection","","22","","26","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Smart grids provide bi-directional communications for the purpose of efficient energy and load management. In addition, energy generation is adjusted based on the load feedback. However, due to the dependency on the cyber infrastructure for load monitoring and reporting, generation control is inherently vulnerable to attacks. Recent studies have shown that the possibility of data integrity attacks on the generation control can significantly disrupt the energy system. In this work, we present simple yet effective data-driven two-tier intrusion detection system for automatic generation control (AGC). The first tier is a short-term adaptive predictor for system variables, such as load and area control error (ACE). The first tier provides a real-time measurement predictor that adapts to the underlying changing behavior of these system variables, and flags out the abnormal behavior in these variables independently. The second tier provides deep state inspection to investigate the presence of anomalies by incorporating the overall system variable correlation using Markov models. Moreover, we expand our second tier inspection to include multi-AGC environment where a behavior of one AGC is validated against the behavior of the interconnected AGC. The combination of tier-1 light-weight prediction and tier-2 offline deep state inspection offers a great advantage to balance accuracy and real-time requirements of intrusion detection for AGC environment. Our results show high detection accuracy (95%) under different multi-attack scenarios.

One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities.

For example, a botnet flooding a network with packets in a denial-of-service attack, or a greedy customer trying to avoid being billed for network utilization, each have a strong incentive to craft packet streams that evade selection by the packet sampler. In this paper, we focus on securing the passive packet sampling mechanisms recommended by PSAMP (the IETF Packet Sampling working group [1]) against adversarial hosts. We show that (1) some of the packet sampling techniques suggested in current drafts of the PSAMP charter have security vulnerabilities, (2) secure uncoordinated sampling can be achieved using random sampling with a cryptographic random number generator, and (3) secure coordinated sampling requires a cryptographic pseudorandom function, keyed with a secret key that should be changed each time the sampler leaks information to the hosts.","","978-1-4244-2483-2","","10.1109/SARNOF.2007.4567339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4567339","","Cryptography;Data engineering;Data security;Fluid flow measurement;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Robustness;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;cryptography;random processes;sampling methods;telecommunication traffic","Internet measurement application;cryptographic pseudorandom function;cryptographic random number generator;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end data-path quality;intrusion detection;packet sampling;security vulnerability;telecommunication traffic","","0","3","9","","","April 30 2007-May 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though DBMS vendors continue to offer greater automation and simplicity in managing databases, the need for specialized intrusion detection database compression technology has not yet been addressed. Our research focuses on developing such technology. The focus is not only on compression but also on database management through planning and best practice adoption to improve operational efficiency, and provide lower costs, privacy and security. The focus in this summary is on the compression part of the DMBS system for intrusion detection. We present a methodology employing grammar-based and large alphabet compression techniques which involves the generation of multiple dictionaries for compressing clustered subfiles of a very large data file. One of the dictionaries is a common dictionary which models features common to the subfiles. In addition, non-common features of each subfile are modeled via an auxiliary dictionary. Each clustered subfile is compressed using the augmented dictionary consisting of the common dictionary together with the auxiliary dictionary for that subfile.","","978-0-615-15314-8","","10.1109/ITA.2007.4357581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4357581","compression;data anonymization;database management;encryption;grammar-based compression;large alphabet;metadata;multiple compression dictionaries;privacy preserving;relational database","Automatic control;Automation;Best practices;Control systems;Costs;Database systems;Dictionaries;Intrusion detection;Spatial databases;Technology management","data compression;data integrity;data privacy;dictionaries;pattern clustering;security of data;very large databases","data consistency;data integrity;data privacy;data redundancy;database management system;grammar-based compression;intrusion detection compression technology;large alphabet compression;multiple dictionary generation;pattern clustering;very large data file","","0","","7","","","Jan. 29 2007-Feb. 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensor nodes placed in remote areas require less attention and supervision, but require significant battery power to survive long periods of time. Recharging or replacing batteries are difficult since units are often placed in areas which are difficult to access. Hence this technology requires sensor nodes to be as autonomic as possible where the nodes should be able to manage themselves without human intervention. We proposed a new mobile agent based energy efficient, self-healing framework for a sensor network. The proposed framework will be implemented in a real world prototype specifically providing detection of illegal entry to designated areas. Such an application might be useful in regulating cross-boundary passage of illegal immigrants to Malaysia.

IPDPS 2006. 20th International","20060626","2006","","","8 pp.","","Selective forwarding attacks may corrupt some mission-critical applications such as military surveillance and forest fire monitoring. In these attacks, malicious nodes behave like normal nodes in most time but selectively drop sensitive packets, such as a packet reporting the movement of the opposing forces. Such selective dropping is hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a lightweight security scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks. The detection scheme uses a multi-hop acknowledgement technique to launch alarms by obtaining responses from intermediate nodes. This scheme is efficient and reliable in the sense that an intermediate node reports any abnormal packet loss and suspect nodes to both the base station and the source node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a detailed scheme for detecting selective forwarding attacks in the environment of sensor networks. The simulation results show that even when the channel error rate is 15%, simulating very harsh radio conditions, the detection accuracy of the proposed scheme is over 95%.","","1-4244-0054-6","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639675","","Application software;Base stations;Computer science;Error analysis;Fires;Intelligent networks;Military computing;Routing protocols;Surveillance;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;wireless sensor networks","mission-critical application;multihop acknowledgement;security scheme;selective forwarding attacks detection;sensitive packet;wireless sensor network","","24","1","20","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The damages suffered from such a threat are personal information leakage, unreasonable charging, root permission acquisition and so on. In addition, it is said that Android, which is considered as the most vulnerable operating system among the smart devices' operating systems, has the greatest damage of malware codes. Accordingly, this paper proposes a technique to detect malicious codes based on Android devices by using the multivariate time-series analysis. A variety of resource information is integrated into a resource to organize data, and an autoregressive moving average model of the time-series models is used to carry out the modeling.

As a scalable and parameter-free unsupervised AD technique, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm has attracted a lot of attention for its applications in computer networks and WSNs. However, the nature of lazy-learning makes the kNN-based AD schemes difficult to be used in an online manner, especially when communication cost is constrained. In this paper, a new kNN-based AD scheme based on hypergrid intuition is proposed for WSN applications to overcome the lazy-learning problem. Through redefining anomaly from a hypersphere detection region (DR) to a hypercube DR, the computational complexity is reduced significantly. At the same time, an attached coefficient is used to convert a hypergrid structure into a positive coordinate space in order to retain the redundancy for online update and tailor for bit operation. In addition, distributed computing is taken into account, and position of the hypercube is encoded by a few bits only using the bit operation. As a result, the new scheme is able to work successfully in any environment without human interventions. Finally, the experiments with a real WSN data set demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and robust.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295612","Complexity theory;Detectors;Encoding;Monitoring;Real time systems;Training data;Wireless sensor network;Wireless sensor networks;anomaly detection;distributed computing;k-nearest neighbor;parameter selection","Complexity theory;Detectors;Encoding;Monitoring;Real time systems;Training data;Wireless sensor networks","computational complexity;hypercube networks;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","WSN;communication cost;computational complexity;computer network;cyberattack protection;distributed computing;hypercube DR;hypersphere detection region;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;lazy-learning problem;parameter-free unsupervised AD technique;positive coordinate space;random fault protection;scalable hypergrid k-NN-based online anomaly detection;wireless sensor network","","8","","30","","2012-09-05","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, we propose a scalable content parser, called COPY, to identify and parse application layer protocols. COPY creates a distinguishable counting context free grammar (DCCFG) to specify the protocol's semantics in application layer, and translates multiple DCCFGs into one distinguishable counting automaton (DCA). DCA is generated without semantic loss from the single DCCFG, and thus provides accurate and scalable parsing ability.

Banking institutions, the insurance and medical professions, goods and commodity exchanges, the airline industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies have all sought increased computer security and confidence in their computer communications. * Computer security techniques, defense methodologies, and security appliances are discussed and analyzed. These discussions will center on various computer and network security devices. With these devices, the foundations for a rigorous security policy can be created. Security policies are important in preventing compromises of network security and threats affecting secure computer communications. Vulnerabilities in computer networks are identified in terms of exploits. The deployment of scanning technologies can discover these exploits and their affects on the integrity of the information exchanged. These same technologies can assign risk factors and pose suggestions for corrective actions in the computer environment. A firewall system installation is deployed on the network of the enterprise to protect and secure a computer communications architecture.

IEEE International Conference on","20060619","2006","1","","8 pp.","","Sensor networks are being increasingly deployed for collecting critical data in various applications. Once deployed, a sensor network may experience faults at the individual node level or at an aggregate network level due to design errors in the protocol, implementation errors, or deployment conditions that are significantly different from the target environment. In many applications, the deployed system may fail to collect data in an accurate, complete, and timely manner due to such errors. If the network produces incorrect data, the resulting decisions on the data may be incorrect, and negatively impact the application. Hence, it is important to detect and diagnose these faults through run-time observation. Existing technologies face difficulty with wireless sensor networks due to the large scale of the networks, the resource constraints of bandwidth and energy on the sensing nodes, and the unreliability of the observation channels for recording the behavior. This paper presents a semi-automatic approach named H-SEND (hierarchical sensor network debugging) to observe the health of a sensor network and to remotely repair errors by reprogramming through the wireless network. In H-SEND, a programmer specifies correctness properties of the protocol (""invariants""). These invariants are associated with conditions (the ""observed variables"") of individual nodes or the network. The compiler automatically inserts checking code to ensure that the observed variables satisfy the invariants. The checking can be done locally or remotely, depending on the nature of the invariant. In the latter case, messages are generated automatically. If an error is detected at run-time, the logs of the observed variables are examined to analyze and correct the error. After errors are corrected, new programs or patches can be uploaded to the nodes through the wireless network. We construct a prototype to demonstrate the benefit of run-time detection and correction","","0-7695-2553-9","","10.1109/SUTC.2006.1636206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1636206","","Aggregates;Application software;Bandwidth;Error correction;Face detection;Fault detection;Large-scale systems;Protocols;Runtime;Wireless sensor networks","computer debugging;error correction;error detection;fault diagnosis;protocols;system recovery;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","H-SEND;fault diagnosis;hierarchical sensor network debugging;observation channel;protocol;semiautomatic approach;software error detection;wireless network","","3","","31","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some challenges are introduced by mobility, such as wireless communication, group navigation, and data collection. Security also represents a challenge during the operation of the MANET. We consider the effects of limited resources (e.g., real-time processing power, battery packs) available on the aircraft. By understanding both the application context and the resource availability, networked aircraft can reorganize to ensure resiliency for the mission if a resource failure occurs within the network.","","978-1-4673-5287-1","978-1-4673-5286-4","10.1109/ICCNC.2013.6504199","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504199","Energy efficiency;Fault tolerance;Mobile ad-hoc networks;Robust and secure wireless communication;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)","Aircraft;Aircraft navigation;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protocols;Routing;Security","aircraft communication;cost reduction;disasters;fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;radio receivers;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","MANET aerial communication;aerial assessment performance;aerial sensing performance;autonomous aircraft deployment;cost minimization;data collection;fault-tolerant;group navigation;mobile ad-hoc network;natural disaster;operational reliability;operator safety;radio receiver;real-time processing power;resource availability;resource failure network;search-rescue application;security;transportation infrastructure;wireless communication","","2","","23","","","28-31 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The overhead network packets can greatly reduce the effectiveness of such detection systems and heavily consume computer resources. To mitigate this issue, a more efficient signature matching algorithm is desirable. In this paper, we therefore develop an adaptive character frequency-based exclusive signature matching scheme that can be implemented in a signature-based NIDS to help improve the performance of signature matching.

In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection scheme, called RADAR, to detect anomalous mesh nodes in WMNs. Firstly, we introduce a general concept of reputation to characterize and quantify the mesh node's behavior/status in terms of fine-grained performance metrics. This enables us to construct a robust baseline for leveraging and measuring the derivation between normal and anomalous behavior of each mesh node. Secondly, based on reputation management, we develop a cooperative anomaly detection scheme by fully exploring the spatio-temporal properties of mesh nodes' behavior. Our current scheme is specified and implemented with a reactive routing protocol, aiming at detecting malicious mesh nodes which intentionally violate normal routing mechanisms. The simulation results show that our scheme performs well in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rate, computational overhead, and scalability.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-1997-5","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489491","","Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Radar detection;Robustness;Routing protocols;Wireless mesh networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","anomalous mesh node detection;intrusion detection system;reactive routing protocol;reputation-based scheme;wireless mesh network","","6","","19","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method works based on a multi-phase process which acts on the IDS generated alerts. In normalization phase, alerts are turned to the form that can be easily processed by the proposed system. In alert Winnowing phase, for each alert is determined that it belongs to which alert sequence or attack scenario. After determining alerts scenarios, for each scenario its sub scenarios and Meta alerts are extracted. Finally, from the produced Meta alerts, the multi-step attack graph is constructed for each attack scenario. We evaluate our approach using DARPA 2000 data sets.

A reduced features set improves system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing process considerably. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method - enhanced support vector decision function (ESVDF)-for features selection. This method selects features based on two important factors: the feature's rank (weight), which is calculated using support vector decision function (SVDF), and the correlation between the features, which is determined by either the forward selection ranking (FSR) or backward elimination ranking (BER) algorithm. Our method significantly decreases training and testing times without loss in detection accuracy. Moreover, it selects the features set independently of the classifier used. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms can deliver satisfactory results in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and testing time.","","978-1-4244-2308-8","978-1-4244-2309-5","10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784780","","Bit error rate;Computer crime;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines","ESVDF;backward elimination ranking;classification accuracy;enhanced support vector decision function;features ranking;features selection;forward selection ranking;intrusion detection systems;support vector machines;testing time;training time","","6","","40","","","10-13 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events. IDSs with active probing are now being proposed for such attacks which involve sending of probe packets that cause difference in sequence of events under attack condition and can be then detected using passive monitoring. In this paper we propose an IDS to detect ARP spoofing attacks using active state-transition framework called “active DES”.","1062-922X","978-1-4577-0652-3","","10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6084088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6084088","ARP spoofing;Active Discrete Event System;Failure Detection and Diagnosis","Adaptation models;Clocks;IP networks;Local area networks;Monitoring;Probes;Protocols","computer network security;computer viruses;discrete event systems;finite state machines;formal specification;formal verification","ARP spoofing attacks;ICMP error message based attacks;Internet Control Message Protocol;active DES;attack detection;discrete event systems;extended FSM;finite state machines;formal analysis;formal modeling;formal verification;malicious behavior detection;network IDS;network activity monitoring;network intrusion detection system;passive monitoring;state-transition based framework;timed FSM","","0","","12","","","9-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Historical evidence based trust management strategy against black hole attacks in MANET","Bo Yang; Yamamoto, R.; Tanaka, Y.","Global Inf. & Telecommun. Inst., Waseda Univ., Tokyo, Japan","Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT), 2012 14th International Conference on","20120403","2012","","","394","399","Distributed, self-organized and infrastructure-independent nature of MANET makes it vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. Among them, a threat caused by black hole attack is more prominent. A trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes while a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing to inner attacks. The previous work proposed two simple models along with trust computation methods to filter out black hole nodes using the benevolent ones and achieved better performance against pure black hole attacks. In this study, a method to prevent gray hole attack, one kind of black hole attack, which is more cunning and clandestine attack is proposed. The neighbour observing model based on watchdog concept is focused on the direct trust value (DTV) to detect single black hole attack. Historical evidence is also taken into consideration against gray hole attacks. Moreover, the neighbour recommendation model that companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to detect the cooperative black hole attacks. On the other hand, the proposed method tries to balance the trust values from different neighbour nodes to mitigate the damage by their deceiving. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attack.","1738-9445","978-1-4673-0150-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174693","Black hole attack;Direct trust value;Grey hole attack;Historical evidence;Indirect trust value;MANET;Trust management strategy","Bismuth;Cryptography;Digital TV;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Nickel;Relays","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;trusted computing","MANET;cooperative black hole attack;gray hole attack;historical evidence based trust management strategy;indirect trust value;inner attack;neighbour observing model;neighbour recommendation model;watchdog concept","","4","","13","","","19-22 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
