Detecting such attacks is especially challenging because most system owners and system administrators use networks to remotely manage the systems they are responsible for. In previous work, we introduced the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) that has a scalable architecture to deal with such threats. This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic. The paper discusses how various high level rules (HLR) can detect new unwanted behaviors without any user intervention. Experiments conducted on three types of applications -- FTP, database, and Web -- show that the enhanced AVPS can detect known and unknown insider attacks through high level rules and process automation.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","","10.1109/SERE.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258317","Insider threat;autonomic computing;network security;privileged user;self-protection","Automation;Databases;Humans;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers","","","","0","","43","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The military holds higher standards of security requirements and thus require special intrusion detection applications. Conventional Intrusion Detection System (IDS) require central control and monitoring entities and thus cannot be applied to MANETs.

Our MCA-based DoS attack detection system employs the principle of anomaly based detection in attack recognition. This makes our solution capable of detecting known and unknown DoS attacks effectively by learning the patterns of legitimate network traffic only. Furthermore, a triangle-area-based technique is proposed to enhance and to speed up the process of MCA. The effectiveness of our proposed detection system is evaluated using KDD Cup 99 data set, and the influences of both non-normalized data and normalized data on the performance of the proposed detection system are examined.

As it is a communications less and source limit network, it is very important to propose secure based energy efficient routing protocol. In order to provide a secure and energy efficient routing protocol, a Privacy Protecting Secure and Energy Efficient Routing Protocol (PPSEER) is proposed. In this protocol, first the classifications of network node take place based on their energy level. After that encryption is done based on group signature. It includes additional secure parameter such as secret key and maximum transmission power which is known only to the sender and recipient node. The advantage of the proposed routing protocol is that it increases privacy of the message as well as it maintains the energy efficiency of the node.","","978-1-4799-4191-9","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992982","AdHoc;Group Signature;Manet;PPSEER;PRISM","Ad hoc networks;Energy efficiency;Privacy;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;energy conservation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","ad hoc network;encryption;group signature;maximum transmission power;network node;privacy protecting secure;recipient node;secret key;secure parameter;security based energy efficient routing protocol;sender node;underlying routing protocol","","0","","11","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure.

In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic. We also extend the V-HashMem architecture to include a header-ID field and support header matching information, a feature missing both from our own earlier work and many related systems.","","1-4244-0312-X","","10.1109/FPL.2006.311244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101006","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Computer science;Costs;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Scalability;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;memory architecture;pattern matching;security of data","CRC functions;FPGA;Snort-like intrusion detection;comparators;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;single memory structure;variable-length Hashmem architecture","","2","","16","","","28-30 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Built on a set of five core service types - interfaces, registries, message brokers, information assurance and system management - SWIM accelerates NAS evolution by defining a secure common infrastructure for application integration and a framework for information modeling and exchange. Providing information security in this distributed network-centric environment is a significant challenge. System users must be confident that their critical data is protected. Competing requirements, the transportation of sensitive data and air-to-ground bandwidth constraints mean that a network layer-based approach to security is no longer sufficient. Trusted security at every layer of a network-centric architecture - combined with strong identity management and a data-oriented approach to information assurance - is the key to success.

We propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network. The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised, the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues. We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property, i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security. Finally, we present the simulation results to justify the feasibility and evaluate the effectiveness of SPREAD.","0743-166X","0-7803-8355-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1354662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1354662","","Application software;Computer network reliability;Computer security;Cryptography;Data security;Intelligent networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","MANET;SPREAD scheme;data confidentiality service;mobile ad hoc network;multipath routing technique;multiple independent path;path set optimization algorithm;secret message protection;secret sharing scheme;security protocol for reliable data delivery","","64","","26","","","7-11 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our measurement study of CDN infrastructure deployed by five major CDN providers shows that dp reduces webpage load time by 29% on average. If dp has already resolved the domain, the reduction in webpage load time is as much as 40%. Finally, dp reduces the load time of individual static Web objects by as much as 43%.

Nevertheless, IoT will likely present dynamic and mobile applications. In this paper, we introduce potential security threats on RPL, in particular Sybil attack when the Sybil nodes are mobile. In addition, we present an analytical analysis and a discussion on how network performances can be affected. Our analysis shows, under Sybil attack while nodes are mobile, that the performances of RPL are highly affected compared to the static case. In fact, we notice a decrease in the rate of packet delivery, and an increase in control messages overhead. As a result, energy consumption at constrained nodes increases. Our proposed attack demonstrate that a Sybil mobile node can easily disrupt RPL and overload the network with fake messages making it unavailable.","","","","10.1109/ISPS.2015.7244960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244960","","Maintenance engineering;Mobile nodes;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;mobile computing;routing protocols","6LoWPAN networks;Internet of Things;IoT;RPL;Sybil attacks;constrained environments;dynamic application;energy consumption;lossy network;low-power network;mobile application;network performance;routing protocol;security threats","","0","","","","","28-30 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within the realm of kernel rootkits, dynamic data rootkits are particularly elusive due to the fact that they attack only data targets. Dynamic data rootkits avoid code injection and instead use existing kernel code to manipulate kernel data. Because they do not execute any new code, they are able to complete their attacks without violating kernel code integrity. We propose a prevention solution that blocks dynamic data kernel rootkit attacks by monitoring kernel memory access using virtual machine monitor (VMM) policies. Although the VMM is an external monitor, our system preemptively detects changes to monitored kernel data states and enables fine-grained inspection of memory accesses on dynamically changing kernel data. In addition, readable and writable kernel data can be protected by exposing the illegal use of existing code by dynamic data kernel rootkits. We have implemented a prototype of our system using the QEMU VMM. Our experiments show that it successfully defeats synthesized dynamic data kernel rootkits in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066457","Virtual machine monitor;dynamic data kernel rootkits;intrusion prevention system","Availability;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Kernel;Manipulator dynamics;Monitoring;Operating systems;Protection;Virtual machine monitors","authorisation;operating system kernels;virtual machines","QEMU VMM;VMM-based guest-transparent monitoring;dynamic data kernel rootkit attack;operating system kernel;virtual machine monitor","","8","4","27","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231","Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks","Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks","","35","","52","","2010-06-10","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a ""neighborhood watch"" concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X","0-7803-7952-7","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","3","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We specially analyze the harm of a type RC intrusion in RPL using ETX metric, which further validates the effectiveness of our work. Second, we design IDSs for RPL to defense intrusions. Our design discusses detection methodologies, system architectures, detection data and intrusion respose with some promotions. To satisfy the energy efficiency requirements, we propose three type Monitor Nodes (MNs) devices for different RPL applications. To explicitly show the design of IDSs, we apply our IDS to defense the type of RC intrusion in RPL using ETX metric on Contiki OS, and the results verify the effectiveness of our IDSs.

Hence, the distributed NIDS architecture must be combined with adequate mechanisms for dynamic load redistribution. In this paper, we propose and compare different policies for the activation/deactivation of the dynamic load balancer. In particular, we consider and compare single vs. double threshold schemes, and load representations based on resource measures vs. load aggregation models.

Center, Hertzelia, Israel","INFOCOM, 2012 Proceedings IEEE","20120510","2012","","","1987","1995","Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most time and resource consuming procedure in contemporary security tools such as Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/IPS), Web Application Firewall (WAF), or Content Filtering Proxy. DPI consists of inspecting both the packet header and payload and alerting when signatures of malicious software appear in the traffic. These signatures are identified through pattern matching algorithms. The portion of compressed traffic of overall Internet traffic is constantly increasing. This paper focuses on traffic compressed using shared dictionary. Unlike traditional compression algorithms, this compression method takes advantage of the inter-response redundancy (e.g., almost the same data is sent over and over again) as in nowadays dynamic Data. Shared Dictionary Compression over HTTP (SDCH), introduced by Google in 2008, is the first algorithm of this type. SDCH works well with other compression algorithm (as Gzip), making it even more appealing. Performing DPI on any compressed traffic is considered hard, therefore today's security tools either do not inspect compressed data, alter HTTP headers to avoid compression, or decompress the traffic before inspecting it. We present a novel pattern matching algorithm that inspects SDCH-compressed traffic without decompressing it first. Our algorithm relies on offline inspection of the shared dictionary, which is common to all compressed traffic, and marking auxiliary information on it to speed up the online DPI inspection. We show that our algorithm works near the rate of the compressed traffic, implying a speed gain of SDCH's compression ratio (which is around 40%). We also discuss how to deal with SDCH compression over Gzip compression, and show how to perform regular expression matching with about the same speed gain.","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195576","","Automata;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Google;Pattern matching;Security;Servers","Internet;computer network security;data compression;pattern matching;transport protocols","Gzip compression;HTTP;Internet traffic;SDCH-compressed traffic inspection;Web application firewall;compression algorithm;content filtering proxy;decompression-free inspection;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;inter-response redundancy;malicious software;network intrusion detection system;network intrusion prevention system;packet header;pattern matching algorithm;payload;regular expression matching;security tool;shared dictionary compression","","2","","25","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4577-1704-8","978-1-4577-1702-4","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","11","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes the use of fine-grain customization and dynamic adaptation as key enabling technologies in a new approach designed to achieve this goal. Customization not only supports software diversity, but also allows customized tradeoffs to be made between different QoS attributes including performance, security, reliability and survivability. Dynamic adaptation allows survivable services to change their behavior at runtime as a reaction to anticipated or detected intrusions or failures.

The AIIDA-SQL agent incorporates a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) engine which is equipped with learning and adaptation capabilities for the classification of SQL queries and detection of malicious user requests. To carry out the tasks of attack classification and detection, the agent incorporates advanced algorithms in the reasoning cycle stages. Concretely, an innovative classification model based on a mixture of an Artificial Neuronal Network together with a Support Vector Machine is applied in the reuse stage of the CBR cycle. This strategy enables to classify the received SQL queries in a reliable way. Finally, a projection neural technique is incorporated, which notably eases the revision stage carried out by human experts in the case of suspicious queries. The experimental results obtained on a real-traffic case study show that AIIDA-SQL performs remarkably well in practice.","","978-1-4244-7363-2","","10.1109/HIS.2010.5600026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5600026","Agent;Artificial Neural Network;Case-Based Reasoning;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection;Support Vector Machine","Artificial neural networks;Book reviews;Classification algorithms;Cognition;Databases;Humans;Support vector machines","SQL;case-based reasoning;neural nets;security of data;support vector machines","AIIDA-SQL agent;CBR engine;SQL injection attack detecting;SQL queries classification;adaptive intelligent intrusion detector agent;artificial neuronal network;case-based reasoning engine;information security;malicious user requests detection;projection neural technique;support vector machine;web applications","","1","","18","","","23-25 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Single sign on (SSO) provides a convenient facility for managing user authentication such that a user only logs into a system once in order to gain access to many protected applications. For this reason it becomes vitally important to secure the SSO server. If an SSO server is compromised, it could potentially put many applications at risk at the same time. The current Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems have proven to be inadequate because the “bad guys” are always one step ahead. In this paper we present a new and innovative approach to SSO server security called “Self-Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance SSO” (SCIT). SCIT shifts the focus from detection and prevention to containing losses, by reducing the exposure time of the servers. Specifically, we present the results of an evaluation of the performance of a SCIT-ized SSO server. In this way we increase the dependability of the server and provide a new way to balance the trade-off between security and availability. We will show that SCIT provides increased security with little degradation in overall response time of the system.","","978-1-4244-7530-8","","10.1109/DEPEND.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562840","SCIT;central authentication service;exposure time;persistence;pro-active;response time;single sign on;virtualization;vmware","Authentication;Browsers;Degradation;Servers;Time factors;Virtual machining","message authentication","IT systems;SSO server;distributed systems;intrusion detection;prevention systems;self cleansing intrusion tolerance SSO;server dependability;single sign on server protection;user authentication","","1","","16","","","18-25 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are extremely vulnerable to a variety of misbehaviors because of their basic features like: lack of communication infrastructure, dynamic network topology and short transmission range. To detect and reduce those misbehaviors, numerous trust management schemes have been proposed for MANETs. To effectively set up MANET, security is one of the main challenges that must be undertaken. The weight based clustering approach is based on combined weight metric that takes into account of several system parameters like the mobility, degree difference, transmission range and battery power of the node. One way to support efficient communication between nodes is to partition ad hoc networks into clusters. Various clustering schemes have been proposed to form clusters. Proposed IWCA algorithm can enhance the trust of cluster formation followed by malicious node removal from cluster head or member selection.","2151-7681","978-1-4673-5997-9","","10.1109/WOCN.2013.6616243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6616243","malicious node;packet drop ratio;packet misroute rate;packet modified rate","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Wireless communication","fault tolerance;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);pattern clustering;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology","IWCA;MANET;dynamic network topology;fault tolerance;improved weighted clustering algorithm;malicious node removal;mobile ad-hoc network;network resource lifetime;numerous trust management scheme;radio transmitter","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing intrusion detection techniques for ad hoc networks are proposed on the network layer. In general, these techniques have difficulty to localize attack source, and can not respond to attacks promptly. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations. We validate our work through ns-2 simulations.

Due to resource constraints, the IDS can only choose K (K <; N) components to probe at each time. An abnormal component incurs a cost per unit time (depending on the criticality of the component) until it is probed and fixed.

We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized. We then apply the analysis results obtained to the design of a dynamic redundancy management algorithm to identify and apply the best design parameter settings at runtime in response to environment changes, to maximize the HWSN lifetime.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.043013.120282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514999","Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;intrusion detection;multipath routing;reliability;security","Energy conservation;Intrusion detection;Multipath channels;Network sensors;Routing protocls;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor management","energy consumption;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","HWSN;dynamic redundancy management algorithm;energy consumption;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intrusion tolerance;multipath routing;optimization problem;query response success probability;security;voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm","","4","","40","","2013-05-13","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Similarly, DBSCAN cannot produce correct result on varied densities. Some variations are proposed to DBSCAN, to show its working in some other domains. In this paper we surveyed some important techniques in which original DBSCAN is modified or enhanced with improvement in complexity or result improvement on varied densities. We define criteria and analyse these variations with complexity (time and space) and output to the original DBSCAN algorithm. We also compare these variations with one another to select the efficient algorithm. In most of the variations partitioning and hybrid methodologies are originated to deal DBSCAN problems.

Persistent attack flows can be relatively easy to trace by mechanisms such as probabilistic packet marking, traffic logging, data mining etc. Sporadic attacks are sometimes easily detected by the intrusion detection systems (IDSs) at the victims, but are hard to trace back to the attack origins. We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4","","10.1109/IPSN.2006.244130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when we monitor a large volume of traffic data for detailed statistics, a long-period or a large-scale network, it is not easy to handle Tera or Peta-byte traffic data with a single server. Common ways to reduce a large volume of continuously monitored traffic data are packet sampling or flow aggregation that results in coarse traffic statistics. As distributed parallel processing schemes have been recently developed due to the cloud computing platform and the cluster filesystem, they could be usefully applied to analyzing big traffic data. Thus, in this paper, we propose an Internet flow analysis method based on the MapReduce software framework of the cloud computing platform for a large-scale network. From the experiments with an open-source MapReduce system, Hadoop, we have verified that the MapReduce-based flow analysis method improves the flow statistics computation time by 72%, when compared with the popular flow data processing tool, flow-tools, on a single host.

Web services are strategic components used by wide variety of organizations for information exchange on the internet scale. The public deployments of mission critical APIs opens up possibility of software bugs to be maliciously exploited. Therefore, vulnerability identification in web services through static as well as dynamic analysis is a thriving and interesting area of research in academia, national security and industry. Using OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) web services guidelines, this paper discusses the challenges of existing standards, and reviews new techniques and tools to improve services security by detecting vulnerabilities. Recent vulnerabilities like Shellshock and Heartbleed has shifted the focus of risk assessment to the application layer, which for majority of organization means public facing web services and web/mobile applications. RESTFul services have now become the new service development paradigm normal; therefore SOAP centric standards such as XML Encryption, XML Signature, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation are nearly not as relevant. In this paper we provide an overview of the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities for web services, and discuss the potential static code analysis techniques to discover these vulnerabilities.

We term this sort of DSN as a heterogeneous distributed sensor network (HDSN). Considering this scenario, we propose a secure membership verification mechanism using one-way accumulator (OWA) which ensures that, before collaborating for a particular task, any pair of nodes in the same deployment group can verify each other's legitimacy of membership. Our scheme also supports addition and deletion of members (nodes) in a particular group in the HDSN.

In this paper, we illustrate our progress with a Software-defined Cloud-Gateway automation system using OpenFlow. In addition, based on our deployment experience, we highlight two technical challenges when using OpenFlow. First, with the standardization being an evolving effort, we highlight some of the programming challenges and missing features within the OpenFlow protocol. Secondly, existing OpenFlow-based network stack lacks some architectural components that reduces the level of flexibility we achieve when programming the network. Most SDN controllers expose limited abstractions to build network applications thereby primarily functioning as an OpenFlow driver. This imposes an application programmer to work with several OpenFlow primitives. To address this problem, we elaborate our current work in extending the SDN stack to improve our overall network programmability experience.","","","","10.1109/CloudNet.2013.6710582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6710582","Cloud Networking;Network Programmability;OpenFlow;Service Provider;Software-defined Networks;VPN","Libraries;Logic gates;Programming;Quality of service;Virtual private networks","cloud computing;internetworking;protocols","OpenFlow driver;OpenFlow protocol;SDN controllers;network visibility;overall network programmability experience;software defined cloud-gateway automation system;software-defined networks;vendor dependency","","1","","27","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A hybrid approach for dynamic intrusion detection in ad hoc networks using genetic algorithm and artificial immune system","Barani, F.","Higher Educ.

Due to special characteristics of these networks, security issue is a difficult task to achieve. Hence, applying current intrusion detection techniques developed for fixed networks is not sufficient for MANETs. In this paper, we proposed an approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune system (AIS), called GAAIS, for dynamic intrusion detection in AODV-based MANETs. GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic. The performance of GAAIS is evaluated for detecting several types of routing attacks simulated using the NS2 simulator, such as Flooding, Blackhole, Neighbor, Rushing, and Wormhole. Experimental results show that GAAIS is more efficient in comparison with similar approaches.","","978-1-4799-3350-1","","10.1109/IranianCIS.2014.6802607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802607","Ad hoc network;Artificial immune system;Genetic algorithm;Intrusion detection;Routing attack","Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Vectors","artificial immune systems;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AIS;AODV-based MANET;GA;NS2 simulator;NicheMGA algorithm;artificial immune system;blackhole simulator;dynamic intrusion detection technique;flooding simulator;genetic algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor simulator;network topology;network traffic;normal feature vector extraction;routing attack simulation;rushing simulator;security;spherical detector;wireless mobile node;wormhole simulator","","0","","13","","","4-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Organization cannot afford any kinds of attacks on their confidential information and resources either from insiders or out-siders. The damage done by insiders is more severe than that of external attackers due to their knowledge about the system and potential targets. It has been observed by studying previous case studies of insider attacks that insiders usually get involve in some unusual or suspicious activities prior to launching actual attacks. So observing these kinds of activities and taking proper actions in time may help to avoid such kinds of attacks. In this paper a risk assessment methodology has been presented to compute the threat levels of insiders. Appropriate actions may be taken by knowing about the threat level of each user in order to avoid actual attacks. The methodology not only incorporates technical measures but also some psychological indicators to detect insiders. The difference of this methodology from the previous ones is that it provides a practical way of quantization of risks for insider threats. The methodology is simulated in a test network against different scenarios and results showed that it efficiently categorized users according to their threat level. So it provides a base to deploy non uniform security policies among the users thus reducing overall processing overheads.","","978-1-4799-7504-4","","10.1109/FIT.2014.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118395","Insider;Organization;Risk;psychological;threat","Computers;Distance measurement;Monitoring;Organizations;Psychology;Security;Software","psychology;security of data","information misuse;insider threat;nonuniform security policy;psychological indicator;risk assessment","","0","","13","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm. Obtained results demonstrates detection accuracy, computational efficiency with minimal false alarms, less system resources utilization.

The limited ability of individual sensor nodes to thwart failure or attack makes ensuring network availability more difficult.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","4","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using a dedicated malware for evading detection at the initial attack, an attacker quietly succeeds in setting up a front-line base in the target organization. Communication between the attacker and the base adopts popular protocols to hide its existence. Because conventional countermeasures deployed on the boundary between the Internet and the internal network will not work adequately, monitoring on the internal network becomes indispensable. In this paper, we propose an integrated sandbox system that deploys a secure and transparent proxy to analyze internal malicious network traffic. The adoption of software defined networking technology makes it possible to redirect any internal traffic from/to a suspicious host to the system for an examination of its insidiousness. When our system finds malicious activity, the traffic is blocked. If the malicious traffic is regarded as mandatory, e.g., For controlled delivery, the system works as a transparent proxy to bypass it. For benign traffic, the system works as a transparent proxy, as well. If binary programs are found in traffic, they are automatically extracted and submitted to a malware analysis module of the sandbox. In this way, we can safely identify the intention of the attackers without making them aware of our surveillance.","","","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2014.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899231","dynamic analysis;malware;sandbox;targeted attack","Electronic mail;Indexes;Internet;Malware;Protocols;Servers","Internet;invasive software;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;cyber attacks;integrated sandbox system;internal malicious network traffic analysis;internal networks;malware analysis module;mass infection malware;secure proxy;secure traffic analysis system;software defined networking technology;transparent proxy","","1","","9","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Zebu: A Language-Based Approach for Network Protocol Message Processing","Burgy, L.; Reveillere, L.; Lawall, J.; Muller, G.","Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ, USA","Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on","20110728","2011","37","4","575","591","A network application communicates with other applications according to a set of rules known as a protocol. This communication is managed by the part of the application known as the protocol-handling layer, which enables the manipulation of protocol messages. The protocol-handling layer is a critical component of a network application since it represents the interface between the application and the outside world. It must thus satisfy two constraints: It must be efficient to be able to treat a large number of messages and it must be robust to face various attacks targeting the application itself or the underlying platform. Despite these constraints, the development process of this layer still remains rudimentary and requires a high level of expertise. It includes translating the protocol specification written in a high-level formalism such as ABNF toward low-level code such as C. The gap between these abstraction levels can entail many errors. This paper proposes a new language-based approach to developing protocol-handling layers, to improve their robustness without compromising their performance. Our approach is based on the use of a domain-specific language, Zebu, to specify the protocol-handling layer of network applications that use textual HTTP-like application protocols. The Zebu syntax is very close to that of ABNF, facilitating the adoption of Zebu by domain experts. By annotating the original ABNF specification of a protocol, the Zebu user can dedicate the protocol-handling layer to the needs of a given application. The Zebu compiler first checks the annotated specification for inconsistencies, and then generates a protocol-handling layer according to the annotations.

To support the MUOS communication demonstrations, a global telecommunications network was constructed interconnecting several system nodes in the continental United States, as well as the global DSN (defense switched network), PSTN and two satellite systems. The heart of the system resides in Scottsdale, Arizona, and consists of two trailers that contain the core network (CN) and radio access network (RAN) of the ""trial system"". Three radio base stations (RJBS) were connected to the radio network controller (RNC) in the RAN to allow users to communicate wirelessly and securely through the cellular system to other wireless users, DSN phones, PSTN phones, Navy legacy communication systems, public internet, plus public and private servers.

Although open source security has been around for years, it has never been as widely used as open source products like the Linux OS or Apache Web server have been. John Pescatore, Internet security research director at market-research firm Gartner Inc., said open source security tools now represent 3 to 5 percent of security-software usage but could comprise 10 to 15 percent by 2007. A key factor in this potential growth is the quality of numerous open source security packages. Open source software products include free tools that users can download from the Internet, packages that come with commercial vendor support, and tools bundled with closed source products. The most popular tools include Netfilter and iptables; intrusion-detection systems such as Snort, Snare, and Tripwire; vulnerability scanners like Nessus and Saint; authentication servers such as Kerberos; and firewalls like T.Rex.

In this paper, we propose a distributed energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomalies in sensed data can be caused due to compromised or malfunctioning nodes. In the proposed approach, we use distributed principal component analysis (DPCA) and fixed-width clustering (FWC) in order to establish a global normal profile and to detect anomalies. The process of establishing the global normal profile is distributed among all sensor nodes. We also use weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve to periodically update the established normal profile. We demonstrate that the proposed distributed approach achieves comparable accuracy compared to a centralized approach, while the communication overhead in the network and energy consumption is significantly reduced.","","978-1-4244-8862-9","978-0-9564263-6-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678106","","Heating;Wireless sensor networks","fault diagnosis;principal component analysis;security of data;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;communication overhead;distributed principal component analysis;fault diagnosis;fixed-width clustering;intrusion detection;wireless sensor networks","","1","","16","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a step for providing secured and reliable broadband services, formal specification logic along with a novel immune-inspired security framework (I2MANETs) have been introduced. The different immune components synchronized to the framework through an agent that has the ability to replicate, monitor, detect, classify, and block/isolate the corrupted packets and/or nodes in a federated domain. The framework functions as the human immune system in: first response, second response, adaptability, distributability, survivability and other immune features.

The method proposed is both passive and remote, so it is not easily detected by the rootkit. The method does not rely on an internal and therefore untrustable timing source, and does not rely on the rootkit's potentially imperfect representation of the actual physical characteristics of the computing platform. For these reasons, it is believed that this method is not subject to criticisms normally leveled against the currently proposed methods of detecting hardware virtualization or hardware virtualization rootkits. Measuring performance degradation requires a baseline, and compared with that baseline, the degradation must be sufficiently great to be judged anomalous with reasonable confidence. That degradation must also be accurately measurable by a trusted and therefore external timing source. Accordingly, the benchmarking experiment that has been devised was performed using commodity hardware and freely available software, to determine which resources virtualization seems to degrade performance most significantly, and of these resources, which are most accurately timed externally. Although the results are preliminary, and strictly speaking, apply only to the actual hardware used in the experiment, they nonetheless show that there is potential to use passive network analysis to detect hardware based virtualization rootkits and associated malware.","","978-1-4673-1108-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6280227","enhanced side-channel analysis;performance benchmarking;rootkit detection","Benchmark testing;Computers;Hardware;Malware;Timing;Virtual machine monitors","benchmark testing;invasive software;virtualisation","commodity hardware;freely available software;hardware virtualization;malware;performance benchmarking;performance degradation;rootkits;side-channel analysis method","","0","","21","","","10-12 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Building effective IDSs, unfortunately, has remained an elusive goal owing to the great technical challenges involved; and applied AI techniques are increasingly being utilized in attempts to overcome the difficulties. This paper presents a comparative study of using support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and linear genetic programs (LGPs) for intrusion detection. We investigate and compare the performance of IDSs based on the mentioned techniques, with respect to a well-known set of intrusion evaluation data gathered by Lincoln Labs. Through a variety of experiments and analysis, it is found that, with appropriately chosen population size, program size, crossover rate and mutation rate, LGPs outperform other techniques in terms of detection accuracy at the expense of time. SVMs outperform MARS and ANNs in three critical aspects of intrusion detection: accuracy, training time, and testing time.","1082-3409","0-7695-2038-3","","10.1109/TAI.2003.1250243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250243","","Artificial intelligence;Computer networks;Computer security;Control systems;Intrusion detection;Mars;Physics computing;Protection;Support vector machines;Terrorism","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;genetic algorithms;neural nets;safety systems;splines (mathematics);support vector machines","ANN;IDS;Lincoln Labs;MARS;SVM;artifical neural network;artificial intelligence;cyber attack;cyber security;cyber terrorism;information security;intrusion detection;intrusion evaluation data;linear genetic program;multivariate adaptive regression splines;network computer;physical security;support vector machine","","13","","26","","","3-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although VM introspection is well studied, its performance has not been reported in detail. The performance becomes important when users choose virtualization software, e.g., Xen and KVM. However, the performance comparison is difficult because there is no efficient implementation of VM introspection in KVM. In this paper, we first propose KVMonitor for efficient VM introspection in KVM. Using KVMonitor, we have ported Transcall for offloading legacy IDSes. For memory introspection, KVMonitor was 32 times faster than the existing LibVMI. Then we present performance comparison between Xen and KVM on VM introspection. The experimental results showed that checking the kernel memory with KVMonitor was 118 times faster than that in Xen.
