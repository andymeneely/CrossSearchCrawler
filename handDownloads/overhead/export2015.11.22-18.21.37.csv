In order to support emerging services, it is clear that a higher degree of monitoring functionality is needed within networks. One approach is to use the programmability and performance of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to allow distributed monitoring but this present challenges around memory usage and highlights the need for a strategically different approach to how flows are monitored. A novel FPGA-based, programmable IP flow monitor is presented, that permits various forms of network monitoring functionality, specifically monitoring of different classes of traffic, to be performed. A key aspect was to address the traditionally long design times, through the use of a new, experimental, high-level design flow called Packet Xpress which allowed functions to be quickly implemented, providing a twentyfold speed-up in design time. The monitor has been implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 based ML506 board and verified in hardware using real Internet traffic traces. The platform allowed us to experiment with various monitoring functions and establish their resource requirements.","","978-1-4244-7936-8","978-1-4244-7938-2","10.1109/ICSAMOS.2010.5642096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5642096","FPGAs;high level design;telecomms monitoring","Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring;Next generation networking;Protocols","IP networks;Internet;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;monitoring;telecommunication traffic","FPGA based programmable IP flow monitor;ML506 board;Packet Xpress;Xilinx Virtex-5;field programmable gate array technology;flexible high speed FPGA;next generation network;real Internet traffic tracing","","0","","19","","","19-22 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) especially NIDS (network intrusion detection system) examine all data features to detect intrusions. However, some of the features may be redundant or contribute little to the detection process and therefore they have great impact on the system performance. This paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model that is computationally efficient and effective based on feature selection and maximum entropy (ME) model. Firstly, the issue of identifying important input features is addressed. Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, therefore results to faster and more accurate detection. Secondly, classic ME model is used to learn and detect intrusions using the selected important features. Experimental results on the well-known KDD 1999 dataset show the proposed model is effective and can be applied to real-time intrusion detection environments.","","1-4244-0800-8","1-4244-0801-6","10.1109/ICCT.2006.341771","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4146353","","Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Computer vision;Entropy;Information systems;Intrusion detection;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Traffic control","feature extraction;maximum entropy methods;security of data;telecommunication security","feature selection;lightweight intrusion detection model;maximum entropy model;network intrusion detection system","","2","","8","","","27-30 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the privacy of all irrelevant flows are still preserved. We formally define the security for MRQED and prove the security of our construction under the decision bilinear Diffie-Hellman and decision linear assumptions in certain bilinear groups. We study the practical performance of our construction in the context of network audit logs.

Then, we analyze some existing cloud based intrusion detection systems (IDS) with respect to their type, positioning, detection time, detection technique, data source and attacks they can detect.

On the other hand, converting the NFA to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can cause state explosion, where the number of states and transitions in the DFA are exponentially larger than in the NFA. In this paper, we seek to answer the following question: to match an arbitrary set of regular expressions, is there a finite automaton that lies between the NFA and DFA in terms of computation and memory complexities? We introduce the semi-deterministic finite automata (SFA) and the state convolvement test to construct an SFA from a given NFA. An SFA consists of a fixed number (p) of constituent DFAs (c-DFA) running in parallel; each c-DFA is responsible for a subset of states in the original NFA. To match a set of regular expressions with n overlapping symbols (that can match to the same input character concurrently), the NFA can require O(n) computation per input character, whereas the DFA can have a state transition table with O(2<sup>n</sup>) states. By exploiting the state convolvements during the SFA construction, an equivalent SFA reduces the computation complexity to O(p<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>) per input character while limiting the space requirement to O(|Σ|×p<sup>2</sup>×(n=p)<sup>c</sup>) states, where Σ is the alphabet and c ≥ 1 is a small design constant. Although the problem of constructing the optimal (minimum-sized) SFA is shown to be NP-complete, we develop a greedy heuristic to quickly construct a near-optimal SFA in time and space quadratic in the number of states in the original NFA. We demonstrate our SFA construction using real-world regular expressions taken from the Snort IDS.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9919-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5934986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5934986","Aho-Corasick algorithm;DFA;NFA;Regular expression;deep packet inspection;graph coloring;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","Automata;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;Pattern matching;Throughput","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;greedy algorithms;pattern matching","NP-complete problem;computation complexity;deterministic finite automaton;greedy heuristic;memory complexity;nondeterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;semi-deterministic finite automata;space-time tradeoff;state explosion","","11","","26","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It acts as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) for the human body and detects anomalies that make the body deviate from its normal behavior. This inspired researchers to build artificial immune systems (AISes) which imitate the behavior of the HIS and are capable of protecting hosts or networks from attacks. An artificial immune system (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period. Although several AISes have been proposed, only a few make use of collaborative approaches. In this paper we propose P2P-AIS, a P2P approach for AISes in which peers exchange intrusion detection experience in order to enhance attack detection and mitigation.

The intuitive approach - encrypting data before uploading to the cloud - is not applicable to MapReduce computation as the data analytics tasks are ad-hoc defined in the MapReduce environment using general programming languages (e.g, Java) and homomorphic encryption methods that can scale to big data do not exist. In this paper, we address the challenges of determining and detecting unauthorized access to data stored in MapReduce based cloud environments. To this end, we introduce alarm raising honeypots distributed over the data that are not accessed by the authorized MapReduce jobs, but only by the attackers and/or unauthorized users.

Many solutions to the notorious problem were proposed. However, they had their own drawbacks. This paper presents a solution called API invocation fingerprint detection (AIFD) to eliminate overflow vulnerability with very low performance penalty. The solution is API-hook-based, which does not require compiler extensions or operating system kernel patches. Unlike other API-hook-based solutions, which will not discover that system calls are actually invoked by malicious code in certain cases, AIFD works well in those cases. By it, programs protected will not yield control to the exploitation code, but rather enter a fail-safe state.

We identify several principles for designing usable access control systems and introduce the usable mandatory integrity protection (UMIP) model that adds usable mandatory access control to operating systems. The UMIP model is designed to preserve system integrity in the face of network-based attacks. The usability goals for UMIP are twofold. First, configuring a UMIP system should not be more difficult than installing and configuring an operating system. Second, existing applications and common usage practices can still be used under UMIP. UMIP has several novel features to achieve these goals. For example, it introduces several concepts for expressing partial trust in programs. Furthermore, it leverages information in the existing discretionary access control mechanism to derive file labels for mandatory integrity protection. We also discuss our implementation of the UMIP model for Linux using the Linux Security Modules framework, and show that it is simple to configure, has low overhead, and effectively defends against a number of network-based attacks.","1081-6011","0-7695-2848-1","","10.1109/SP.2007.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223222","","Access control;Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Linux;Operating systems;Permission;Power system security;Protection;Usability","Linux;authorisation;systems analysis","Linux security module framework;mandatory usable access control system;network-based attack;operating system;usable mandatory integrity protection","","10","","24","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Actually, their salient features, essentially the absence of infrastructure and auto-management, promise huge applications and possibilities for wireless communication. However, the tremendous boom of these networks depends incontestably on their reliability in terms of security and quality of services (QoS). In this paper, we study the ad hoc security vulnerabilities for which cryptographic-based solutions are ineffective and which require IDS. Appropriate designed IDS services appear essential as countermeasures to those threats, where previous IDS proposals often seem to be too sophisticated in the ad hoc environment and merely ineffective. Our goal here is to provide an IDS mechanism dedicated to the OLSR protocol, fitting to its characteristics and operation, and designed to avoid its vulnerabilities. Hence, our proposed IDS represents an urgent and primary line of defense since it protects from the protocol flaws themselves avoiding a significant panoply of easily operated attacks.","1525-3511","1-4244-0658-7","1-4244-0659-5","10.1109/WCNC.2007.487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4224732","","Ad hoc networks;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Defense industry;Intrusion detection;Proposals;Protection;Quality of service;Telecommunication network reliability;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;security of data","IDS services;OLSR protocol;ad hoc networks;quality of services;security services","","1","","12","","","11-15 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The network-wide dissemination of program code is not appropriate in every WSN due to the heterogeneity of sensor hardware, the diversity of sensing tasks, and the event and location dependency of software. Thus, a flexible and group-wise selective Over-The-Air Programming (OTAP) is required in these scenarios. Furthermore, securing the OTAP protocol is imperative in order to prevent unauthorized and malicious reprogramming attempts. In this paper, we introduce SenSeOP, a selective and secure OTAP protocol for WSNs. For this purpose, the proposed protocol uses multicast transfer supported by asymmetric cryptography.

The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques. The results show that our technique yields fewer false alarms and can handle large traces with smaller (or comparable) processing times compared against the existing techniques for the host based anomaly intrusion detection systems.","","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2013.6698896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698896","Host-based Intrusion Detection System;Software Reliability;Software Security","File systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linux;Training","Linux;probability;security of data","Firefox dataset;Linux based program;UNM datasets;anomalous trace;anomaly identification;contemporary test suites;hacking technique;host based anomaly intrusion detection approach;kernel module state;normal trace;state interaction analysis;state occurrence probability;system behaviour visual understanding;system call representation;system call semantic interaction","","2","","38","","","4-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.","0090-6778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693","Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing","Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection","cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user","","0","","37","","2014-08-21","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected ad hoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected ad hoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000times2000 m <sup>2</sup>) can only improve from 76.5% to 79.9% with selective dropping attacks. Thus, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile ad hoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data dropping attacks performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76.5% with selective dropping attacks. With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87% (with a single ferry) to 93% (with four ferries) with selective dropping attacks. Without the mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio with black hole attacks drops to 65.9%. With FBIDM, the achieved delivery ratio ranges from 82.9% (with a single ferry) to 91.9% (with four ferries) with black hole attacks","","1-4244-0617-X","1-4244-0618-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086633","DSR;DoS resilience;disruption tolerant networkst;intrusion detection;routing;sparsely connected adhoc networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data","FBIDM scheme;ferry-based intrusion detection-mitigation scheme;mobile ad hoc network;sparsely connected network","","3","","17","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our focus is on detecting anomalous behaviour using timing analysis of routing traffic within the network. We first show how to identify intruders based on the protocol irregularities that their presence creates once they begin to drop traffic. More significantly, we go on to demonstrate that the mere existence of the wormhole itself can be identified, before the intruders begin the packet-dropping phase of the attack, by applying simple signal-processing techniques to the arrival times of the routing management traffic. This is done by relying on a property of proactive routing protocols- that the stations must exchange management information on a specified, periodic basis. This exchange creates identifiable traffic patterns and an intrinsic ""valid station"" fingerprint that can be used for intrusion detection","","1-4244-0617-X","1-4244-0618-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086522","","Communication system traffic control;Fingerprint recognition;Information management;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Signal processing;Stress control;Testing;Timing","IP networks;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;multiprocessor interconnection networks;routing protocols;security of data;signal processing;telecommunication traffic","IPv6 802.11b wireless MANET;customised analysis tools;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;packet timing analysis;proactive routing protocol;routing management traffic;signal-processing technique;wormhole attack detection","","9","","26","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This prototypical control problem is relevant in network security applications. The objective is for each node to detect and isolate the misbehaving nodes using only the information flow adopted by standard consensus protocols. We focus on the single misbehaving node problem. Our technical approach is based on the theory of unknown input observability.

Proceedings of the 23rd IEEE International Symposium on","20041108","2004","","","195","204","The paper proposes a combined hardware/software approach for realizing high performance, intrusion- and fault-tolerant services. The approach is demonstrated for (yet not limited to) an attribute authority server, which provides a compelling application due to its stringent performance and security requirements. The key element of the proposed architecture is an FPGA-based, parallel crypto-engine providing (1) optimally dimensioned RSA Processors for efficient execution of computationally intensive RSA signatures and (2) a KeyStore facility used as tamper-resistant storage for preserving secret keys. To achieve linear speed-up (with the number of RSA Processors) and deadlock-free execution in spite of resource-sharing and scheduling/synchronization issues, we have resorted to a number of performance enhancing techniques (e.g., use of different clock domains, optimal balance between internal and external parallelism) and have formally modeled and mechanically proved our crypto-engine with the Spin model checker. At the software level, the architecture combines active replication and threshold cryptography, but in contrast with previous work, the code of our replicas is multithreaded so it can efficiently use an attached parallel crypto-engine to compute an attribute authority partial signature (as required by threshold cryptography). Resulting replicated systems that exhibit nondeterministic behavior, which cannot be handled with conventional replication approaches. Our architecture is based on a preemptive deterministic scheduling algorithm to govern scheduling of replica threads and guarantee strong replica consistency.","1060-9857","0-7695-2239-4","","10.1109/RELDIS.2004.1353020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1353020","","Application software;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Cryptography;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Hardware;Processor scheduling;Software performance;System recovery","authorisation;cryptography;digital signatures;fault tolerant computing;hardware-software codesign;program verification;scheduling;software architecture","FPGA-based parallel crypto-engine;KeyStore facility;Spin model checker;active replication;attached parallel crypto-engine;attribute authority partial signature;attribute authority server;computationally intensive RSA signature;formal modeling;hardware-software approach;high performance fault-tolerant service;high performance fault-tolerant system;high performance intrusion-tolerant service;high performance intrusion-tolerant system;optimally dimensioned RSA Processor;preemptive deterministic scheduling;replica consistency;replica threads;replicated system;security requirement;tamper-resistant storage;threshold cryptography","","2","3","37","","","18-20 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is capable of detecting the abnormal operating status of a process and thus reporting a possible intrusion. This method requires a smaller size of training data set compared with other methods, less effort to collect training data and is more suitable for real-time detection.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

Consequently, we show the IPM can reduce 87% of TCAM entries to extract 17 bytes pattern and w = 4. Moreover, we observed that IPM can perform the scanning of packets at 10.941Gbps and it spent 5.79LC/Char to implement the IPM. Then, we achieved the 1.89 Gbps/LC of PHC score.

A new approach to system call monitoring based on authenticated system calls is introduced. An authenticated system call is a system call augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the system call arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls. This paper presents the approach, describes a prototype implementation based on Linux and the PLTO binary rewriting system, and gives experimental results suggesting that the approach is effective in protecting against compromised applications at modest cost.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467810","Intrusion tolerance;compiler techniques;operating systems;sandboxing;security policy","Application software;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Costs;Cryptography;Kernel;Message authentication;Protection;Prototypes","Linux;cryptography;data integrity;formal verification;message authentication;program compilers;program diagnostics;rewriting systems","Linux;binary rewriting system;cryptographic message authentication code;data integrity;static analysis;system call argument;system call authentication;system call monitor;system call verification","","7","3","24","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths. Simulation results show that the overhead of running AIS system does not vary and is consistent for topological changes. The system also proves that the proposed system is well suited for intrusion detection and prevention in wireless network.","","","","10.1109/ICESC.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745417","AIS;congestion;intrusion detection;mobility","Bandwidth;Delays;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;artificial immune systems;jamming;packet radio networks;radio networks;security of data","AIS system;IP network;MAC address;agent based intrusion detection system;artificial immune system;jamming signal;negative clone selection;network topology;session hijacking;wireless intrusion signature;wireless network","","0","","12","","","9-11 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ever increasing online and real time transaction services have led to manifold rise in the problems associated with the database security. Attacker uses illegal and unauthorized approaches to hijack the confidential information like username, password and other vital details. Hence the real-time transaction requires security against web based attacks. SQL injection and cross site scripting attack are the most common application layer attack. The SQL injection attacker pass SQL statement through a web application's input fields, URL or hidden parameters and get access to the database or update it. The attacker take a benefit from user provided data in such a way that the user's input is handled as a SQL code. Using this vulnerability an attacker can execute SQL commands directly on the database. SQL injection attacks are most serious threats which take user's input and integrate it into SQL query. Reverse Proxy is a technique which is used to sanitize the users' inputs that may transform into a database attack. In this technique a data redirector program redirects the user's input to the proxy server before it is sent to the application server. At the proxy server, data cleaning algorithm is triggered using a sanitizing application. In this framework we include detection and sanitization of the tainted information being sent to the database and innovate a new prototype.","","","","10.1049/cp.2013.2592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950876","Cross Site Scripting Attack;Data Sanitization;Database Security;SQL Attack;SQL Injection;Security Threats","","Internet;SQL;database management systems;query processing;security of data","Internet;SQL code;SQL injection attacker;SQL query;SQL statement;URL;Web application;Web based attacks;application layer attack;confidential information;cross site scripting attack;data redirector program;data security;database attack;database security;illegal approaches;intrusion prevention;proxy server;real-time transaction;reverse proxy framework;sanitization technique;transaction services;unauthorized approaches","","0","","","","","18-19 Oct. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds.

The observed behavior of the system is analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov chain model of the norm profile supports the observed behavior.

We analyze software crashes with a symbolic failure model by performing concolic executions following the failure directed paths, using a whole system environment model and concrete address mapped symbolic memory in S<sup>2</sup> E. We propose a new selective symbolic input method and lazy evaluation on pseudo symbolic variables to handle symbolic pointers and speed up the process. This is an end-to-end approach able to create exploits from crash inputs or existing exploits for various applications, including most of the existing benchmark programs, and several large scale applications, such as a word processor (Microsoft office word), a media player (mpalyer), an archiver (unrar), or a pdf reader (foxit). We can deal with vulnerability types including stack and heap overflows, format string, and the use of uninitialized variables. Notably, these applications have become software fuzz testing targets, but still require a manual process with security knowledge to produce mitigation-hardened exploits. Using this method to generate exploits is an automated process for software failures without source code. The proposed method is simpler, more general, faster, and can be scaled to larger programs than existing systems. We produce the exploits within one minute for most of the benchmark programs, including mplayer. We also transform existing exploits of Microsoft office word into new exploits within four minutes. The best speedup is 7,211 times faster than the initial attempt.

Asa result, ROOM can only activate the matching operations on a (small) part of the rules that could be possibly hit. Weformulate the optimal rule organization problem of ROOM mathematically and demonstrate it to be NP-hard, and then wepropose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem with the time complexity of O(N<sup>2</sup>) (N is the number of fields in the rule set).

We describe a novel architecture that supports such advanced features using a network of state machines. We also present a compiler that maps the regexs onto such networks that can be efficiently realized on reconfigurable logic.

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","30","1","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Models constructed using static analysis have the highly desirable feature that they do not produce false alarms; however, they may still miss attacks. Prior work has shown a trade-off between efficiency and precision. In particular, the more accurate models based upon pushdown automata (PDA) are very inefficient to operate due to non-determinism in stack activity. In this paper, we present techniques for determinizing PDA models. We first provide a formal analysis framework of PDA models and introduce the concepts of determinism and stack-determinism. We then present the VP-Static model, which achieves determinism by extracting information about stack activity of the program, and the Dyck model, which achieves stack-determinism by transforming the program and inserting code to expose program state. Our results show that in run-time monitoring, our models slow execution of our test programs by 1% to 135%. This shows that reasonable efficiency needs not be sacrificed for model precision. We also compare the two models and discover that deterministic PDA are more efficient, although stack-deterministic PDA require less memory.","1081-6011","0-7695-2136-3","","10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1301324","","Automata;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Personal digital assistants;Runtime;State-space methods;Testing","authorisation;formal specification;program diagnostics;pushdown automata;telecommunication security","Dyck model;VP-Static model;formal analysis;information extraction;intrusion detection;program execution monitoring;program testing;pushdown automata;run-time monitoring;stack-determinism;static analysis","","15","1","27","","","9-12 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel approach for enhanced intrusion detection system for malicious node is proposed here to protect against attacks in ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol. The proposed approach employs a method for determining conditions under which malicious node should be monitored. Apart from identification of malicious node, it has been observed that this approach leads to less conservation and less communication breakage in ad hoc routing.

A new intrusion detection system named bandwidth shared acknowledgment (BSA) in which all transmission packet data and acknowledge should be cryptographically signed. Swarm Based Detection techniques for multiple paths establishment among source to destination and random casting is use during intrusion in MANETs. Eavesdropping in MANET is scheduled based on number of acknowledgement received at every instance in network. The theme of this paper is to provide a seamless message delivery in a MANET despite its threats using random casting and the existing mechanisms like 2-hop acknowledgement or source directed acknowledgement does not hold when a network topology changes frequently or when a node is compromised. These drawbacks are to be addressed ensuring secured connecting edges between source and destination. The source collision, exposure to vulnerability is also minimized using this mechanism.

It is critical to configure an IDS in a dynamic and iterative fashion to balance the security overhead and system performance. In this paper, we use noncooperative game approaches to address this problem. We first build a fundamental game framework to model the zero-sum interactions between the detector and the attacker. Building on this platform, we then formulate a stochastic game model in which the transitions between system states are determined by the actions chosen by both players. An optimal policy-based configuration can be found by minimizing a discounted cost criterion, using an iterative method. In addition, we propose a Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal game values when the transitions between system states are unknown. We show the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal Q-function and illustrate the concepts by simulation.","0191-2216","978-1-4244-3871-6","978-1-4244-3872-3","10.1109/CDC.2009.5399894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5399894","","Convergence;Cost function;Detectors;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Stochastic systems;System performance","computer network security;game theory;security of data","Q-learning algorithm;attacks detection;discounted cost criterion;dynamic policy based IDS configuration;game framework;information systems performance;intrusion detection system;iterative method;networked information systems;noncooperative game;optimal IDS configuration;optimal game values;optimal policy based configuration;security enforcement level;security enforcement tool;security overhead;stochastic game model;system performance;zero-sum interaction","","8","","23","","","15-18 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In turn, legal traces are specified through a context-free grammar returned by a static analysis of P program that may also compute assertions. At run-time, each time P invokes a system call, PsycoTrace checks that the trace is coherent with the grammar and assertions are satisfied. To increase overall robustness, PsycoTrace's run-time tool relies on two virtual machines that run, respectively, P and the monitoring system. This strongly separates the monitored machine that runs P from the monitoring one. The current implementation is fully transparent to P but not to the OS because a kernel module in the monitored machine intercepts system calls. We describe PsycoTrace overall architecture and focus on the run-time and introspection tools that enable the monitoring machine to check that a trace is legal and to transparently access the memory of the other machine to evaluate assertions.

To date, however, no published work has evaluated identity-only obfuscation approaches against using IPsec ESP tunnels as a way of hiding endpoint identities. The question is, are there some network configurations where identity-only obfuscation techniques work better than IPsec ESP tunnels? We present arguments that low-overhead MTN identity-only obfuscation approaches may work more efficiently on wireless mobile, tactical, peer-to-peer networks where processing energies and transmission bandwidth are constrained and we also discuss features of metrics for measuring the success of moving target network approaches, helping to guide future research in this area.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-1729-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415740","","Bandwidth;Encryption;IP networks;Logic gates;Payloads","IP networks;computer networks","IPsec ESP tunnels;MTN techniques;computer networks;identity-only obfuscation techniques;moving target network;moving target networks;network reconnaissance steps;organization internal network;peer-to-peer networks;tactical networks;wireless mobile","","0","","20","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data collected from IoT is usually offloaded to the Cloud which may further leave data prone to a variety of attacks if security and privacy issues are not handled properly. Anomaly detection has been one of the widely adopted security measures in wired and wireless networks. However, it is not straight forward to apply most of the anomaly detection techniques to IoT and cloud. One of the main challenges is deriving outlier features from the vast volume of data pumped from IoT to the cloud. Other challenges include the large number of sources generating data, heterogenous connectivity and traffic patterns of IoT devices, cloud services being offered at geographically remote places and causing IoT data to be stored in different countries with different legislations. This paper, for the first time, presents the challenges and opportunities in anomaly detection for IoT and cloud. It first introduces the prominent features and application fields of IoT and Cloud, then discusses security and privacy risks to personal information and finally focuses on solutions from anomaly detection perspective.","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247572","","Big data;Cloud computing;Internet of things;Privacy;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Web services;cloud computing;data privacy;security of data","IoT concept;IoT devices;anomaly detection techniques;cloud services;cloud-centric Internet of Things;personal information;privacy breach;privacy preservation;privacy risks;security breach;security risks;wired networks;wireless networks","","","","33","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem is how to overcome the known limitations of current wireless sensor networks to support multimedia applications in terms of throughput, delay and jitter while being energy efficient. This paper presents LEMR-multichannel, an extension of LEMR for real-time applications over wireless sensor networks to address these issues. LEMR-multichannel takes advantage of the delay, jitter and energy-efficiency of LEMR, and includes an energy-efficient new dynamic duty cycle multi-channel medium access mechanism that uses the different channels available in the single transceiver device to enhance the throughput capability of the network.

Since sensor networks are resource-constrained devices, their design needs to minimize efforts without compromising the task's integrity. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach for an intrusion detection based on the structure of naturally occurring events. With the acquired knowledge distilled from the self-organized criticality aspect of the deployment region, we apply a hidden Markov model. In other words, we let our sensor network adapt to the norm of the dynamics in its natural surroundings so that any unusual activities can be singled out.

For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of “self-driving” cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of “connected vehicles” (United States) or “cooperative ITS” (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities.

Two modes for deception are proposed and the deception is executed by nodes that the neighboring to the attacker. We simulate a denial of service attack and simulation results show that under deception most of the useful traffic is delivered to the base station.

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we use the ns-2 network simulator to demonstrate the vulnerability of the MintRoute protocol to link quality attacks by a malicious node. We then propose a novel ""sequence number gap trick"" as a lightweight means to test for and detect the presence of a malicious attacker.

This paper presents methods for isolating the malicious traffic by using a honeypot system and analyzing it in order to automatically generate attack signatures for the Snort intrusion detection/prevention system. The honeypot is deployed as a virtual machine and its job is to log as much information as it can about the attacks. Then, using a protected machine, the logs are collected remotely, through a safe connection, for analysis.

The approach within the research project ASYMOF (Energy Autonomous Microsystems with Mechanical Energy Harvester for Mobile (Safety-) Applications) is to use the example of a wireless glass break detection system. This paper presents a new wireless energy autonomous sensor network for automobile applications with built-in safety features like plausibility checks, encryption and radio channel monitoring. Special focus is laid on the MAC layer protocol design. Due to the fact that there are situations when a car is parked, e.g. in a parking garage, where not much energy can be harvested from ambient energy sources, the wireless sensor network has to be designed very energy efficient. Power consumption of the proposed wireless sensor network is computed and compared with other wireless networks employing different types of ALOHA MAC layer protocols for handling sporadic traffic without significant control overhead.","","978-1-4673-1590-6","978-1-4673-1589-0","10.1109/SSD.2012.6198098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198098","Wireless sensor networks;automotive;energy autonomous","Base stations;Glass;Media Access Protocol;Power demand;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;automotive electronics;energy conservation;energy harvesting;mobile radio;power consumption;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","ALOHA;ASYMOF;MAC layer protocol;automobile safety system;built-in safety feature;electronic system;energy autonomous microsystems with mechanical energy harvester for mobile;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;network traffic handling;parking garage;power consumption;wireless energy autonomous sensor network","","0","","8","","","20-23 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to efficiently program multiple processing elements and utilize various memory modules as well as the hardware resources on network processors are always challenges. In this paper, we investigate several optimization issues and programming techniques that should be considered by the developers to achieve higher packet processing rate on network processors. We use an existing packet classification scheme called hierarchical binary prefix search (HBPS) as the benchmark to test and evaluate these optimization techniques.

While performance remains a key differentiator for these devices, the complexity and rate of change in the supported applications has made general-purpose platforms an attractive alternative to ASICs and network processors. General-purpose platforms offer excellent programmability and a wealth of existing software, in the form of operating systems, libraries, and applications that can be used to build a packet-processing system; however, the performance of general-purpose operating systems is unacceptable for many environments. This has driven developers to either make derivative versions of existing operating systems or to use special-purpose operating systems with a less comprehensive and familiar library of existing software. As part of the Symerton project, we propose using virtualization to address these issues. We have designed a system that has a virtual machine dedicated to high-performance networking, and a virtual machine dedicated to hosting non-performance critical tasks in a general-purpose operating system. Using a proof-of-concept implementation, we show that the resulting system outperforms a general-purpose operating system by an average of 22% for a real networking application. We also discuss tradeoffs that will need to be considered in further development of systems using this design.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579531","communications systems;networking;virtualization","Acceleration;Application software;Buildings;Cryptography;Hardware;Operating systems;Sockets;Software libraries;Virtual machining;XML","computer networks;operating systems (computers);virtual machines","ASIC;Symerton project;XML processing;network processors;operating systems;packet processing complexity;proof-of-concept implementation;service provider networks;virtual machine","","0","6","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","0","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
