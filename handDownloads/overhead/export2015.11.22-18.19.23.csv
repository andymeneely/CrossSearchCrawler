However, current distributed intrusion detection system mostly uses distributed component to collect data then sent to processing center. Data is analyzed in the processing center. These models have the following problems: bad real time capability, bottleneck, and single point of failure. In order to overcome these shortcomings of current intrusion detection techniques, a new distributed intrusion detection model based on mobile agent is proposed in this paper. Intelligent and mobile characteristics of the agent are used to make computing move to data. As mobile agent can only improve the structure of system and can not supply fundamental new detecting techniques, improved dynamic clonal selection algorithm and collaborative signal mechanism are adopted for reducing false positive rate and increasing detection rate in this paper. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm were simulated by KDDpsila99 datasets. Comparing with winning entry of KDDpsila99 classifier learning contest, the proposed model has low false positive rate and higher detection rate in both Dos and Probing attacks, and greatly higher detection rate in U2R attack. Robustness and dynamic adaptability of the system are validated.","","978-0-7695-3699-6","","10.1109/APCIP.2009.249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5197236","dynamic clonal selection;intrusion detection system;mobile agent","Autonomous agents;Collaboration;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Detectors;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents","mobile agents;security of data","collaborative signal mechanism;distributed component;distributed intrusion detection model;dynamic clonal selection algorithm;immune mobile agent;intelligent agent;intrusion detection system;processing center","","0","","8","","","18-19 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current implementations allow passengers to access Internet for pleasure and in some cases secure VPN access is provided to corporate networks. Several researchers are looking at the possibility of the existence of a total of three networks: passenger network (PN); crew network (CRN); and the control network (CON). Researchers envision an architecture where these three networks will co-exist in an airplane. The available Internet connectivity can be utilized for transporting flight critical information like cockpit flight data recorder (CFDR) data, digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data, cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data, and controller pilot data link communication. In addition, the Internet connectivity could also be used for other safety mechanisms like video surveillance and remote control of the flight. Security is one of the major concerns that affect the successful deployment of aircraft data networks (ADN) and other safety features. Several studies have been carried out to secure the network using firewalls and intrusion detection system but so far no study has focused on securing the communication channel (between the aircraft and the ground station) and its impact on the ADN. The scope of this research is to determine the viability and need of a security mechanism. The research also focuses on the performance of different security architectures and determine their usability in the framework of an ADN.","0885-8985","","","10.1109/MAES.2006.1635168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635168","","Aerospace safety;Aircraft;Airplanes;Communication system control;Communication system security;Data security;IP networks;Internet;Video surveillance;Virtual private networks","Internet;aerospace computing;aircraft communication;aircraft displays;virtual private networks","Internet connectivity;VPN access;aircraft data networks;cockpit flight data recorder data;cockpit voice recorder data;communication channel;control network;controller pilot data link communication;corporate networks;crew network;digital flight data recorder data;flight critical information;intrusion detection system;passenger network;remote control;video surveillance","","1","","17","","","May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","12","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.","1060-9857","978-0-7695-3826-6","","10.1109/SRDS.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421","exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware","Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server","Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security","HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit","","1","1","36","","","27-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","1","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2198666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198335","Industrial networks;information security;network security;risk assessment;security analysis and monitoring;security countermeasures","Availability;Guidelines;NIST;Process control;Risk management;Security;Servers","computer network security;production engineering computing;risk management","Information and Communication Technology;cyber threat;detect-and-patch philosophy;distributed ICT infrastructure;general-purpose computer network protection;industrial computer network;industrial distributed computing system;security countermeasure;security issues;security risk","","17","","105","","2012-05-10","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this method, an explicit, coupled enthalpy model is used to simulate the growth of an equiaxed dendrite, while a Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to track the movement of the dendrite in the convecting melt in a two-dimensional Eulerian framework. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the enthalpy model in simulating the dendritic growth involving complex shape, and the accuracy of VOF method in conserving mass and preserving the complex dendritic shape during motion. Simulations are performed in presence of uniform melt flow for both fixed and moving dendrites, and the difference in dendrite morphology is shown.","","0-7803-9311-2","","10.1109/TENCON.2005.301288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085379","","Abstracts","","","","0","","","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%.

This paper presents the design and implementation of VAOFS, a Verifiable Append-Only File System for regulatory compliance. Verifiability is provided by a tamper resistant hardware device cooperating with an instrumented file system. Non-appending operations can be detected in an audit process. A time-based secure deletion method is also proposed to handle file deletion in VAOFS.

Our proposed solution takes into account practical issues such as limited resources of the mobile nodes. It has distinct advantages such as monitoring of the traffic to the victim node and the attack traffic being dropped before reaching the victim, the ability to trace back the attacking node and prevent the attack at the home agent or foreign agent that is closer to the attacking node, and the ability to deal with dynamic changes in attack traffic patterns.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","27","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We argue that monitoring data can be treated differently. Some data capture critical system events, the arrival of these data will significantly influence the monitoring reaction speed, we call them urgent data. High speed urgent data collection would help system to act in real time when facing fatal error. On the other hand, slowing down the collection speed of others may render more bandwidth.

It makes operating-system-based security tools undergo all kinds of hardships in face of various attacks. Virtualization technology brings a new chance to protect operating systems out-of-box in hypervisors. This article proposes a system monitoring and controlling framework, named as BMCS, which monitors low-level states and hardware accessing events of operating system in a hypervisor. BMCS abstracts low-level states and events and profiles OS-level semantics with the help of a hosted daemon. Moreover, it can control the execution of operating system software through the hypervisor. Our out-of box method can collect real run-time operating system profile and control the execution of the OS according some defined rules. As a result, it makes the operating system stronger.

Although VPN technology is very useful, it imposes security threats on the remote network because its firewall does not know what traffic is flowing inside the VPN tunnel. To address this issue, we propose VGuard, a framework that allows a policy owner and a request owner to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy without the policy owner knowing the request and the request owner knowing the policy. We first present an efficient protocol, called Xhash, for oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, without disclosing their numbers to each other. Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of VGuard is to first convert a firewall policy to nonoverlapping numerical rules and then use Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. Comparing with the Cross-Domain Cooperative Firewall (CDCF) framework, which represents the state-of-the-art, VGuard is not only more secure but also orders of magnitude more efficient. On real-life firewall policies, for processing packets, our experimental results show that VGuard is three to four orders of magnitude faster than CDCF.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557862","Virtual private networks;network security.;privacy","Computers;Encryption;IP networks;Privacy;Protocols;Servers;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;protocols;virtual private networks","VGuard framework;VPN technology;Xhash protocol;cross-domain cooperative firewall;encryption tunnel;firewall policy;privacy preserving collaborative enforcement;virtual private networks","","5","","16","","2010-08-26","May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The data sensors posting as designated agents are to gather information from their respective sources in real time. The information gathered by the respective agent is fed into the detector where correlation methods and data mining techniques are employed to analyze and identify any intrusive activity or event. Since information is gathered from various sources by the respective agent, different type of profiles representing normal behavior such as network traffic, users, systems, applications, transactions, alarms and alerts can be built, and deviation from these profiles are considered to be intrusion. A rating model is then used to evaluate the intrusive activities. When an intrusion or attack is detected by the detector and evaluated to have a rating below the threshold value, the configuration device changes the status of the ID/IP system to alert mode and signal the alert and response device to take the necessary actions.

Actually, managing MANETspsila security is a hard challenge due to the inherent complexity and the tremendous number of parameters which should be considered. To provide efficient security management, we focus on three main parameters: the secured device capabilities, the associated network security and the secured applications. The solution we propose, named Adaptive Secured Multipath for Ad hoc networks (ASMA) is a scalable, flexible and application-oriented framework able to manage security depending on the application requirements and the network security conditions. ASMA is based on a structure called macrograph combining both dynamic trust management and multipath routing. The macrograph structure is capable to estimate transmission security in order to assure that communications are established only when they match applications security requirements.

However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol. We perform simulations in ns-2 to demonstrate that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged while listening energy saving of 30 to 129 times is achieved, depending on the network load.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273007","Sensor networks;local monitoring;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna.","Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Delay;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensor systems and applications;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","sensor networks;sleep-wake aware local monitoring;telecommunication traffic","","6","","30","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a model-based technique for building intrusion detection systems (IDS) for smart meters, that takes these constraints into account.

Malicious behavior may target the disruption of communications, infrastructure services, and applications. A number of ID techniques proposed for dynamic wireless networks (e.g., sensor, ad-hoc and mobile ad-hoc networks) are based on the creation of an overlay hierarchy or other structure to organize the collection and processing of ID data. The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency. Specifically, we introduce analytical expressions that map ID structures to the metric space of real numbers. We define this mapping for a) various types of tree structures that have been proposed previously for dynamic wireless systems and b) a hypercube structure that presents promising resiliency characteristics.

In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort.

The goal is to create a more abstract picture of program behavior filtering out many irrelevant details. Our specific approach automatically identifies repeating sub-sequences of behavior events and sequences of events that always occur together.

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490","","Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SAVE messages propagate valid source address information from the source location to all destinations, allowing each router along the way to build an incoming table that associates each incoming interface of the router with a set of valid source address blocks.

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols.

The novelty lies in the fact that a node can correctly validate who it is, but lie about its location and exploit this to create problems to the network. There are three main factors that make ad hoc networks more vulnerable: (a) nodes can overhear other nodes announcements, (b) nodes can lie about their location, and (c) nodes can avoid detection and isolation by moving. As a result, malicious nodes can fake their position and this way obstruct the routing.

IEEE International Conference on","20071105","2007","","","164","173","It is crucial to detect zero-day polymorphic worms and to generate signatures at the edge network gateways or honeynets so that we can prevent the worms from propagating at their early phase. However, most existing network-based signatures generated are not vulnerability-based and can be easily evaded by attacks. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","","978-1-4244-1588-5","978-1-4244-1588-5","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","12","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various kinds of attack have been identified and corresponding solutions have been proposed. Wormhole attack is one of the serious attacks which forms a serious threat in the networks, especially against many ad hoc wireless routing protocols and location-based wireless security system. We identify two types of wormhole attacks. In the first type, malicious nodes do not take part in finding routes, meaning that, legitimate nodes do not know their existence. In the second type, malicious nodes do create route advertisements and legitimate nodes are aware of the existence of malicious nodes, just do not know they are malicious. Some researchers have proposed detection mechanisms for the first type. In this paper, we propose an efficient detection method called delay per hop indication (DelPHI). By observing the delays of different paths to the receiver, the sender is able to detect both kinds of wormhole attacks. This method requires neither synchronized clocks nor special hardware equipped mobile nodes. The performance of DelPHI is justified by simulations.","","0-7803-9410-0","","10.1109/ISWPC.2006.1613586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1613586","Ad Hoc;Security;Tunnel;Wireless;Wormhole","Clocks;Communication system security;Data communication;Delay;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Synchronization;Telecommunication traffic;Tunneling;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;data communication;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication security","DelPHI;ad hoc wireless routing protocols;data transmission;delay per hop indication;location-based wireless security system;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc wireless networks;route advertisements;untrusted wireless environment;wormhole attacks;wormhole detection mechanism","","20","","14","","","16-18 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and not able to reach destination causing high end-to-end delay and low throughput. Previously little amount of work is done for detection and prevention of the Blackhole attack in the WSN making its detection and prevention very crucial as per network performance is concerned.

Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent. We have also developed a prototype active splitter on an IXP1200 network processor and show that the cost of the proposed approach is reasonable.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593585","Network-level security and protection;intrusion detection and prevention.;network processors","Costs;Filtering;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Protocols;Prototypes;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","buffer storage;distributed sensors;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security","active splitter architecture;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;load distribution;load-balancing traffic splitter;locality buffering;memory access locality;network processor;network-level protection;network-level security","","19","","39","","","Jan.-March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Evading these attacks has created a lot of attention from researchers. A number of monitoring and filtering devices have been developed to verify the authenticity of the packets based on the packet payload data in intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the methods used for IDS cannot be deployed in DDoS filters since in DDoS attacks, a lot of packets arrive in a short span of time and deriving packet payload patterns become cumbersome with these IDS algorithms. This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm. This three-level filter was tested in the ANTS active network tool kit with the 1999 DARPA IDS dataset as the back end. Results validate the proposed scheme's efficiency and the time complexity of the filter proposed is smaller than IDS payload scanning methodologies.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809140","ANTS;Anomaly detection;Distributed Denial of Service attack;Eigen Vector;Payload modeling;String matching","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Filtering;Filters;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;message authentication;string matching;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;active network;distributed denial-of-service attack;eigen vector;flooding attack;intrusion detection system;optimal string matching algorithm;packet authenticity;packet payload data;payload driven security model","","1","1","11","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings IEEE","20050822","2005","4","","2372","2382 vol. 4","Client puzzles have been proposed in a number of protocols as a mechanism for mitigating the effects of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","14","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper aims at utilizing potential benefits from applying distributed multiagent technology to network security. To facilitate information exchange between different agents in our proposed hybrid layered multiagent architecture, a low-cost and low response time agent communication protocol is developed to tackle the issues typically associated with a distributed multiagent system, such as poor system performance, excessive processing power requirement, and long delays. The bandwidth and response time performance of the proposed end-to-end system is investigated through the simulation of the proposed agent communication protocol on our private LAN testbed called Hierarchical Agent Network for Intrusion Detection Systems (HAN-IDS). The simulation results show that our proposed system is efficient and extensible since it consumes negligible bandwidth with low cost and low response time.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-4000-9","978-0-7695-3638-5","10.1109/AINA.2009.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076193","Agent Architecture;Agent Communication;IDS;KQML","Bandwidth;Communication system security;Costs;Delay;Information security;Intrusion detection;Multiagent systems;Power system security;Protocols;Technology management","local area networks;multi-agent systems;protocols;security of data","communication protocol;hybrid layered multiagent architecture;network intrusion detection systems;network security","","0","","20","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But it often lacks global cooperative capability. When facing attacks, e.g., DDoS, an intrusion detection system (IDS) needs an overall scheme to respond properly. Also, Internet consists of network management units (NMUs). It would be better if several nearby surrounding NMUs can collaboratively guard and protect their important surrounded neighbor. In this article, we propose an intrusion forecast and traceback system (IFTS) based on union defense environment. IFTS monitors network forwarding traffic, thus forecasting malicious behaviors for its neighbor NMD, called protected NMU (P-NMU). With forecasting, P-NMU can predetermine the way to treat the intrusion packets.

To improve the speed and the storage-efficiency, complex regexs are decomposed into simpler subexpressions, where each subexpression can fire one or more instructions. Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

The objective of this paper is to find mitigation actions for attacks that might be launched against AMI. The paper introduces a tool called SecAMI that calculates the relationship between the speed at which an attack spreads, the speed at which it can be detected, and the consequences on the availability of the AMI. The results from SecAMI can be used as a performance metric to significantly improve the development and the deployment of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in an AMI environment.

Independent state provides us with a wealth of possible applications that hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of NIDSs. We discuss an implementation of independent state for the Bro NIDS and examine how we can then leverage independent state for distributed processing, load parallelization, selective preservation of state across restarts and crashes, dynamic reconfiguration, high level policy maintenance, and support for profiling and debugging.

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes. The classification rate of above 99% is obtained. Cost - Benefit analysis is done for the various attack detection methods and the ROC curves are also plotted.","","978-1-4673-5037-2","","10.1109/ICE-CCN.2013.6528514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528514","Attack Detection;Classification;Cost-Benefit Analysis and ROC Curve;Intrusion Detection;Layered Approach","Accuracy;Data mining;Data models;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Probes;Training","Bayes methods;cost-benefit analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;trees (mathematics)","CFS;DoS;IDS;J48;KStar;Naïve Bayes;Probe;R2L;ROC curves;RandomSubspace;RotationForest;U2R;correlation based feature selection;cost-benefit analysis;data near BalancedND;enhanced attack detection methods;feature selection;information assets;intrusion detection systems;layered approach;multiclass classifier;multiple learning based classifiers;ordinal class classifier;random forest;random tree;security infrastructure;security systems;system administrators","","1","","7","","","25-26 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For high dimensional data, feature selection can find the information-rich feature subset, thus enhance the classification accuracy and efficiency. Based on a improved feature selection algorithm, this paper proposes a lightweight intrusion detection model with computational efficiency and high detection accuracy. The algorithm is based on information gain and SVM. Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy). The experimental results demonstrated that our approach can find features subsets with higher classification accuracy compared with feature selection algorithm based on information gain and GA.","","978-1-4244-6325-1","978-1-4244-6326-8","10.1109/ISISE.2009.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447161","IDS;feature selection;information gai;svm","Ad hoc networks;Artificial neural networks;Costs;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;redundancy;security of data;set theory;support vector machines","GA;SVM algorithm;ad hoc network;bad detection rate;classification accuracy;computational efficiency;computing resources;data intrusion detection processing system;feature redundancy removal approach;feature selection algorithm;high detection accuracy;information gain;information-rich feature subset;long training time;secure information systems;support vector machine","","0","","15","","","26-28 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we analyze the SIP protocol and show that it can easily be exploited to mount effective and large-scale botnets. We do this by scrutinizing the details of the SIP protocol and show how it offers a variety of ways to conceal botnet traffic within legitimate-looking SIP traffic. Using our analysis, we implement a SIP bot and present experimental results from a real testbed network. In addition, we employ traffic statistics collected from a large telecommunication provider and discuss the implications for both botnet design and detection. Finally, we present a software tool (called autosip) to generate synthetic traffic that resembles actual SIP traffic with different controllable characteristics.
