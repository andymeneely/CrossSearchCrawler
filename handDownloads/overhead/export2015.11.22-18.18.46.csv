However, attack trends change very fast nowadays, making it impossible to keep up with manual signature engineering. This paper describes a novel concept for automatic signature generation based on efficient autonomous attack classification. Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance. We argue that a general description of zero-day attacks is immanently restricted to syntactical features and outline how valid signatures for novel real-world attacks were successfully generated.","","978-1-4244-5786-1","","10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403022","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Production;Protection;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security","Nebula;automatic signature generation;autonomous attack classification;malicious activity identification;positional information;signature accuracy;signature matching;signature-based intrusion detection;syntactical network intrusion signatures","","3","","16","","","13-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7980-6","","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions","Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching","","0","","24","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance. We test the effectiveness of PAIDS with trace-driven simulations and show that PAIDS has a high detection rate and a low false positive rate.","0730-3157","978-0-7695-3726-9","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254234","Intrusion Detection System;Proximity;Worm","Application software;Collaborative work;Computer applications;Computer worms;Educational institutions;Failure analysis;Impedance;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis","Internet;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;PAIDS;anomaly detection;proximity-assisted intrusion detection system;signature-based scheme;unidentified worm","","0","","35","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses the issue of D-NCS information security as well its time-sensitive performance with respect to network security schemes. We use a wireless network based, robot navigation path tracking system called Intelligent Space (iSpace) as a D-NCS test bed in this paper. The paper classifies the delay data from every NCS module (sensors, actuators and controllers). We define performance parameters for this NCS test bed. Various system factors including network delay, system gain, affecting these performance parameters are recognized. Network security algorithms DES and 3DES are integrated with the application to secure the sensitive information flow. Standard statistical approach such as 2<sup>k</sup> factorial experiment design, analysis of variance, hypothesis testing is used to study and estimate the effect of each factor on the system performance especially security features.

We propose a head-body finite automaton (HBFA), which implements SPM in two parts: a head DFA (H-DFA) and a body NFA (B-NFA). The H-DFA matches the dictionary up to a predefined prefix length in the same way as AC-DFA, but with a much smaller memory footprint. The B-NFA extends the matching to full dictionary lengths in a compact variable-stride branch data structure, accelerated by single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. A branch grafting mechanism is proposed to opportunistically advance the state of the H-DFA with the matching progress in the B-NFA. Compared with a fully populated AC-DFA, our HBFA prototype has <;1/5 construction time, requires <;1/20 runtime memory, and achieves 3x to 8x throughput when matching real-life large dictionaries against inputs with high match ratios.

Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implementation based on empirical BGP routing updates.

Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic. As far as we know we are the first paper, that analyzes the problem of 'on-the-fly' multi-patterns matching algorithms on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061944","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Compression algorithms;Computer science;Data security;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;data compression;digital signatures;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;GZIP compression;HTTP protocol;Web traffic;compressed HTTP traffic;decompression phase;malicious activity detection;network security tool;signature-based detection;string-matching algorithm","","5","3","25","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be a complex task. In this article we describe an integrated framework for the design, evaluation, and deployment of network resilience strategies. These strategies describe the management behavior of a number of federated, policy-controlled resilience mechanisms, such as monitoring and detection systems.

However, their vulnerability to various attacks makes the security problem extremely prominent. The main reasons are its distributed, self-organized and infrastructure independent natures. As concerning these problems, trust management scheme is a common way to detect and isolate the compromised nodes when a cryptography mechanism shows a failure facing inner attacks. Among huge numbers of attacks, black hole attack may collapse the network by depriving the route of the normal communication. The conventional proposed method achieved good performance facing black hole attack, while failing to detect gray hole attacks. In this paper, a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence based trust management strategy is proposed to conquer not only cooperative black hole attack but also gray hole attack. In the proposed method, a neighbour observing model based on watchdog mechanism is used to detect single black hole attack by focusing on the direct trust value (DTV). Historical evidence is also taken into consideration to go against gray hole attacks. Then, a neighbour recommendation model companied with indirect trust value (ITV) is used to figure out the cooperative black hole attack. D-S evidence theory is implemented to combine ITVs from different neighbours. Some of the neighbour nodes may declare a false ITV, which effect can also be diminished through the proposed method. The simulation is firstly conducted in the Matlab to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Then the security routing protocol is implemented in the GloMoSim to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy. Both of them show good results and demonstrate the advantages of proposed method by punishing malicious actions to prevent the camouflage and deception in the attacks.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779177","Black hole attack;Dempster-Shafer evidence;Direct trust value;Gray hole attack;Indirect trust value;MANETs;Trust management","Ad hoc networks;Digital TV;Educational institutions;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptography;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;GloMoSim;MANET;Matlab;cooperative black hole attacks;cryptography mechanism;gray hole attacks;indirect trust value;neighbour observing model;trust management strategy;watchdog mechanism","","0","","11","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In light of recent advances in storage capacity and sharp drop in prices of storage devices, as well as the demand for trustworthy storage systems, it is timely to design and develop fast storage systems that practically have no limit in capacity and admit ""secure append-only"" operations (namely data can only be appended to a storage device; once appended it can no longer be modified, and can be read out by authorized users only.) This paper reports some preliminary findings in our research into building a secure append-only storage system.

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, emerging data intensive applications are increasingly unstructured - irregular in their memory and control flow behavior over massive data sets. While the irregularity in these applications can result in poor workload balance among fine-grained threads or coarse-grained blocks, one can still observe dynamically formed pockets of structured data parallelism that can locally effectively exploit the GPU compute and memory bandwidth. In this study, we seek to characterize such dynamically formed parallelism and and evaluate implementations designed to exploit them using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism (CDP) - an execution model where parallel workload are launched dynamically from within kernels when pockets of structured parallelism are detected. We characterize and evaluate such implementations by analyzing the impact on control and memory behavior measurements on commodity hardware. In particular, the study targets a comprehensive understanding of the overhead of current CDP support in GPUs in terms of kernel launch, memory footprint and algorithm overhead. Experiments show that while the CDP implementation can generate potentially 1.13x-2.73x speedup over non-CDP implementations, the non-trivial overhead causes the overall performance an average of 1.21x slowdown.","","978-1-4799-6452-9","","10.1109/IISWC.2014.6983039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983039","","Arrays;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Measurement;Parallel processing","graphics processing units;resource allocation;storage management","CUDA dynamic parallelism;coarse-grained blocks;control flow behavior;dynamic parallelism analysis;dynamic parallelism characterization;dynamically formed parallelism;dynamically formed pockets;emerging data intensive applications;fine-grained threads;massive data sets;memory behavior;structured applications;structured data parallelism;unstructured GPU applications;workload balance","","0","","31","","","26-28 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This ability is particularly relevant as devices become increasingly adaptive through the development of software-defined and frequency agile radios. Adaptive devices can alter their behavior in a way that is noncompliant to a given set of standards and thus cause problems for other compliant devices, We address this deficiency by developing and assessing a mechanism for detecting misbehaving nodes in wireless systems. While we developed our system on an 802.11 network, the same approach could readily be applied to other wireless networks. Our mechanism is based on a reputation-enabled intrusion detection system, in which a centralized trust authority monitors traffic and collects secondhand information on potentially misbehaving nodes. The system integrates a mixture of alarms and reports to calculate a reputation vector of all nodes in the system. An XML based policy engine is used to detect policy violations. These mechanisms are built to be flexible and extensible in order to deal with the issues arising out of software programmable devices. In extending beyond traditional intrusion detection, our approach will incorporate physical layer information, such as power and frequency use, in determining improper behavior. In evaluating the system, we consider how our mechanism, 1) impacts system performance, 2) correctly identifies misbehaving nodes, 3) addresses ""bad mouthing"" and 4) resists collusion.","","1-4244-1315-X","1-4244-1316-8","10.1109/SDRN.2007.4348973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4348973","","Engines;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Physical layer;Radiofrequency identification;Standards development;System performance;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;XML","","","","0","","22","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A secure sensor network communication protocol relies on the substantial secure, robust and efficient key management system. We put forward a new hybrid group key management scheme for hierarchical self organizing wireless sensor network architecture. By using this approach, multi-level security can be achieved to secure groups of sensors at different levels. We place the cryptographic burden where the resources are less constrained, at the forwarding nodes and the access points. In our proposed scheme, access points and forwarding nodes initially perform a key agreement protocol and each sensor node in a cluster later on establishes a group key with the forwarding node using a key transport scheme dynamically after deployment.","","978-0-7695-3324-7","","10.1109/IAS.2008.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627059","hierarchical sensor network;key establishment;key management","Authentication;Computer network management;Conference management;Cryptographic protocols;Information security;Organizing;Public key cryptography;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Technology management;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;self-organising feature maps;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","WSN;hierarchical self-organizing sensor network;key agreement protocol;secure hybrid group key management;sensor network communication protocol;wireless sensor network","","0","","21","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These are mainly used for the command & control of spacecraft and the exploitation and dissemination of space-based services to end users. A new ESA activity, the European Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Initiative, requires a novel generation of mission data systems to be developed. These systems are based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and capable of supporting a large system-of-systems environment. At the same time, information security is an area of growing concern in the space business and among space agencies. Especially in the area of SOA-based environments, where interconnectivity of components is a core principle, an efficient and robust security concept needs to be put in place to ensure secure mission operations. In this paper, we describe an application security framework for SOA-based mission data systems. This framework increases significantly the robustness and security of web services and web applications through use of a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) and provision of tools & templates for SSA mission data system developers. We are confident that the application security framework will drastically improve the security and robustness of SOA-based mission data systems that will be used in the European SSA Initiative and other ESA projects, while at the same time keeping the related additional effort minimal.","","978-1-4577-0712-4","978-1-4577-0713-1","10.1109/SMC-IT.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007775","Information Security;Secure Software Development Lifecycle;Service-Oriented Architectures;Software Engineering;System-of-Systems","Computer architecture;Data systems;Europe;Programming;Risk management;Security;Service oriented architecture","Web services;command and control systems;safety-critical software;security of data;service-oriented architecture;space vehicles","European space situational awareness;SOA-based mission data systems;Web applications;Web services;application security framework;command & control;component interconnectivity;information security;secure software development lifecycle;service-oriented architecture;space agencies;space-based services;spacecraft;system-of-systems","","3","","12","","","2-4 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A BV is normally associated with a default interest group (e.g., power grid operator). When the BV accesses its default charging or communication point, it works in the home mode. The BV may move around and temporarily access other aggregators, and then it works in the visiting mode. In this paper, we first identify that, for an aggregator, BVs have different security challenges when they work in different modes. Then, we propose an aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication scheme (AP3A) to achieve simultaneous identification and secure identification for different working mode BVs. In AP3A, BVs are differentiated into either home or visiting mode, and multiple BVs can be simultaneously authenticated by an aggregator to conserve communication resources. In addition, the aggregated pseudo-status variation is presented to realize that multiple BVs' power status can be collected as a whole without revealing any individual privacy. We perform comprehensive analysis on the proposed scheme, including attack analysis, security analysis, and performance analysis. It is shown that AP3A can resist major attacks for security protection and privacy preservation, and can be an efficient authentication approach for V2G networks.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2212730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6336849","Authentication;privacy;security;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Authentication;Batteries;Electric vehicles;Privacy;Protocols;Vehicles","battery powered vehicles;power system protection;power system security;smart power grids","AP3A;V2G network;aggregated pseudostatus variation;aggregated-proofs based privacy-preserving authentication;attack analysis;battery vehicle charging status;communication resource;multiple BV power status;performance analysis;secure identification;security protection analysis;smart grid;vehicle-to-grid network","","7","","31","","2012-10-22","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing network traffic capture frameworks, however, provide applications with raw packets and leave complex operations like flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly to application developers. This gap, between what applications need and what systems provide, leads to increased application complexity, longer development time, and most importantly, reduced performance due to excessive data copies between the packet capture subsystem and the stream processing module. This paper presents the Stream capture library (Scap), a network monitoring framework built from the ground up for stream-oriented traffic processing. Based on a kernel module that directly handles flow tracking and TCP stream reassembly, Scap delivers to user-level applications flow-level statistics and reassembled streams by minimizing data movement operations and discarding uninteresting traffic at early stages, while it inherently supports parallel processing on multi-core architectures, and uses advanced capabilities of modern network cards. Our experimental evaluation shows that Scap can capture all streams for traffic rates two times higher than other stream reassembly libraries.

Although they both perform regular expression matching, they have quite different performance and memory usage properties. DFAs provide fast and deterministic matching performance but suffer from the well-known state explosion problem. NFAs are compact, but their matching performance is unpredictable and with no worst case guarantee. In this paper, we propose a new automaton representation of regular expressions, called tunable finite automaton (TFA), to deal with the DFAs' state explosion problem and the NFAs' unpredictable performance problem. Different from a DFA, which has only one active state, a TFA allows multiple concurrent active states. Thus, the total number of states required by the TFA to track the matching status is much smaller than that required by the DFA. Different from an NFA, a TFA guarantees that the number of concurrent active states is bounded by a bound factor b that can be tuned during the construction of the TFA according to the needs of the application for speed and storage. Simulation results based on regular expression rule sets from Snort and Bro show that, with only two concurrent active states, a TFA can achieve significant reductions in the number of states and memory usage, e.g., a 98% reduction in the number of states and a 95% reduction in memory space.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905778","Regular expression;finite automaton;pattern matching;state explosion","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Encoding;Explosions;Memory management","finite automata;pattern matching;public domain software;security of data","Bro;DFA;NFA;Snort;TFA;concurrent active states;network intrusion detection systems;nondeterministic finite automatons;pattern matching;regular expression rule sets;tunable finite automaton","","0","","25","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing schemes base routing path construction on faces defined by the planar graph. Once running on a particular planar graph, none of the existing schemes is flexible enough to adapt the sequence of faces visited by the constructed path. Thus, real-world constraints such as network congestion, limited node energy levels, or non-cooperation of nodes might severely impact the performance and the robustness of existing planar graph routing variants. To address this problem, we extend planar graph routing with one further degree of freedom: control over the sequence of visited faces. Basically, our face routing extension now follows a sequence of faces intersected by any curve we can freely adjust. We investigate basic schemes for choosing curves dealing with imperfections in the network, and derive algorithms for routing and forwarding along these curves. We analytically prove that our scheme is loop free and allows for guaranteed delivery in arbitrary planar connected graphs. We implement curve-based routing and show its feasibility by means of a simulation study. As a proof-of-concept scenario, we investigate the case of non-cooperating nodes.

Encryption cannot fully protect the data communicated between nodes, as routing information may expose the identities of the communicating nodes and put their relationships at risk. In this paper, we propose an efficient anonymous routing protocol that uses a mobile agent paradigm for wireless and mobile ad hoc networks. In our protocol, only trustworthy nodes are allowed to participate in communications and the misbehavior of malicious nodes is thus prevented effectively. We describe our protocol and provide its performance evaluation based on simulation experiments implemented in an ns-2 simulator.

In general, existing solutions are not effective to provide protection and security against attacks sinkhole on IoT, and they also introduce high consumption of resources de memory, storage and processing. Further, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban scenarios, like smart cities. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system, called INTI (Intrusion detection of SiNkhole attacks on 6LoWPAN for InterneT of ThIngs), to identify sinkhole attacks on the routing services in IoT. Moreover, INTI aims to mitigate adverse effects found in IDS that disturb its performance, like false positive and negative, as well as the high resource cost. The system combines watchdog, reputation and trust strategies for detection of attackers by analyzing the behavior of devices. Results show the INTI performance and its effectiveness in terms of attack detection rate, number of false positives and false negatives.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140344","","Base stations;Internet of things;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Routing;Security;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;security of data","6LoWPAN;INTI;Internet of Things;IoT networks;intrusion detection system;secure routing;sinkhole attacks","","0","","16","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Routing protocols can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious nodes to disrupt the normal routing behavior. In fact, vulnerabilities may even exist in secure versions of the routing protocols, which makes secure routing a real challenge to achieve. In this paper, we present vulnerability analysis of AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) routing protocols against routing attacks. SAODV is a secure version of the basic AODV protocol that uses asymmetric key cryptography. We simulate a number of routing attacks to show that SAODV can counter most attacks that are successful against AODV. However, SAODV has vulnerabilities of its own that allow replay attacks to succeed. We, therefore, propose a new security scheme, Robust SAODV (R-SAODV), which incorporates temporal time stamping of SAODV extensions. Temporal time stamping addresses the issue of replay attacks by ensuring the freshness of the exchanged control messages. Our simulation results in ns-2 indicate that our proposed security scheme, R-SAODV, is able to achieve similar performance as SAODV. This implies that we have achieved added security with less additional cost to the system.","","978-1-4577-0110-8","","10.1109/WiAd.2011.5983282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983282","Performance;SAODV;routing attacks on AODV","Ad hoc networks;IP networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocols;MANET;SAODV routing protocols;asymmetric key cryptography;exchanged control messages;network routing attacks;secure routing;temporal time stamping;vulnerability assessment","","1","","18","","","20-22 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"WinWizard: Expanding Xen with a LibVMI Intrusion Detection Tool","Lamps, J.; Palmer, I.; Sprabery, R.","Comput.

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection. WinWinzard has demonstrated to be successful in detecting these types of rootkits, while causing little additional overhead to other virtual machines being hosted on the same hy- ervisor.","","978-1-4799-5062-1","","10.1109/CLOUD.2014.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973823","Intrusion Detection Systems;Virtualized-based security;Xen","Instruction sets;Kernel;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;LibVMI intrusion detection tool;WinWizard;Xen;cloud infrastructures;intrusion detection system;memory introspection;virtual machine introspection","","0","","26","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes rely on each other to store and forward packets. Most of the proposed MANET protocols assume cooperative and friendly network context, and do not address security issues. Furthermore, MANETs are highly vulnerable for passive and active attacks because of their open medium, rapidly changing topology, lack of centralized monitoring. Encryption and authentication solutions, which are considered as the first line of defense, are not sufficient to protect MANETs from packet dropping attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for MANETS rely on the Watchdog technique. In this research we study the behavior of this technique and propose a novel mechanism, named: Adaptive ACKnowledgment (AACK), for solving two significant problems: the limited transmission power and receiver collision. This mechanism is an enhancement to the TWOACK scheme where its detection overhead is reduced while the detection efficiency is increased. NS2 is used to simulate and evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it against the TWOACK and Watchdog methods. The obtained results show that the new AACK scheme outperforms both of the TWOACK and Watchdog methods in terms of network packet delivery ratio and routing overhead.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-6695-5","","10.1109/AINA.2010.136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474764","AACK;DSR;IDS;MANET;Misbehaving;TWOACK;Watchdog;packet dropping","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Power system protection;Protocols","ad hoc networks;cryptography;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing","MANET;adaptive acknowledgment intrusion detection;authentication solutions;encryption;forward packets;mobile ad-hoc network;network packet delivery ratio;node detection enhancement;routing overhead;wireless links","","4","","20","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by conventional intrusion detection methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","1536-1284","","","10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599218","","Communication system traffic control;Engines;Feedback control;Hidden Markov models;Hysteresis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Traffic control;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;three-term control","cooperative ad hoc wireless network;distributed hidden Markov model;feedback control engine;intrusion detection","","6","","17","","","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The purported benefit of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects. This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely influence transactional memory performance. In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions within 25 % for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux. The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks) are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system. The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many factors influence the performance of transactional programs, getting good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly appreciated.","","978-1-4244-6023-6","978-1-4244-6024-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2010.5452061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5452061","","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Memory architecture;Pathology;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Program processors;Programming profession;Yarn","Linux;data structures;operating system kernels;transaction processing","Syncchar;TxLinux kernel;compiler;data structures;memory allocator;modified Andrew benchmark;transactional memory system;transactional programming;user-level transactional programs","","2","1","40","","","28-30 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some studies find that in real SMT processor like Intel Xeon processor with hyper-threadings, the sharing resources (like cache) contention between threads can hurt the processing performance of network applications like servers or IDS. How to make protocol processing cope with the advances in computer architecture has been widely studied. In this paper, we put our focus on the processing performance of TCP automata phases, using execution based simulations to model the relationship between each phase performance and cache size, and then measuring the cache contention between threads. We find (1) the load/store units can be the bottleneck of protocol processing; and (2) in connection establishing phase of TCP processing, cache contention between threads is more aggressive than any other phase. We also suggest a FSM decomposition based parallel processing approach to use sharing cache of SMT processors effectively.","1097-2641","1-4244-1138-6","1-4244-1138-6","10.1109/PCCC.2007.358913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197949","Cache;FSM decomposition;Protocol processing;SMT","Application software;Automata;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protocols;Surface-mount technology;Yarn","finite state machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","FSM decomposition;Intel Xeon processor;SMT processor;TCP automata phases;cache contention;high speed network security;hyper-threading;protocol processing","","0","","30","","","11-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nostalgics observed a parallel between the emerging paradigm of cloud computing and the traditional time-sharing era, depicting clouds as the modern reincarnation of mainframes available on a pay-per-use basis, and equipped with virtual, elastic, disks-asa-service that replace the old physical disks with quotas. This comparison is fascinating, but more importantly, in our opinion, it prepares the ground for constructive critiques regarding the security of such a computing paradigm and, especially, one of its key components: web services. In this paper we discuss our position about the current countermeasures (e.g., intrusion detection systems, anti-malware), developed to mitigate well-known web security threats. By reasoning on said affinities, we focus on the simple case study of anomaly-based approaches, which are employed in many modern protection tools, not just in intrusion detectors. We illustrate our position by the means of a simple running example and show that attacks against injection vulnerabilities, a widespread menace that is easily recognizable with ordinary anomaly-based checks, can be difficult to detect if web services are protected as they were regular web applications. Along this line, we concentrate on a few, critical hypotheses that demand particular attention. Although in this emerging landscape only a minority of threats qualify as novel, they could be difficult to recognize with the current countermeasures and thus can expose web services to new attacks. We conclude by proposing simple modifications to the current countermeasures to cope with the aforesaid security issues.","","978-1-4577-1449-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978790","Cloud Computing;Security;Web Services","Cloud computing;Debugging;Programming;Protocols;Security;Software","Web services;cloud computing;invasive software","Web security threats;Web services;anti-malware;cloud computing;information and communication technology;injection vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;protection tools;security issues;security measures;utility computing","","0","","48","","","1-2 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead.

In our proposed scheme, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level intrusion detection is presented to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques. The network is divided to zones with one zone manager which is monitoring on cluster heads in its zone, but the most important problem is how can recognize the trustworthiness of zone manager which is done by “honest neighbors” of zone manager.

In this paper, we present a model for network processors that can aid in evaluating different run-time support systems. The model considers workload characteristics of applications and network traffic. We use a queuing network abstraction to model different runtime systems.

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48.

Nodes communicate together through a wireless connection that might be subject to different attacks when the network is placed in hostile environments. Furthermore, the nodes are usually equipped with very small batteries providing limited battery life, therefore limited power consumption is of utmost importance for nodes. This is in clear opposition with the requirement of providing security to communications as security might be very expensive from the power consumption stand point. Energy harvesting methods can be used to recharge batteries, but, in most of the cases the recharge profile cannot be known in advance. Therefore, nodes might face periods of time in which no recharge is available and the battery level is low. In this paper we introduce an optimization mechanism that allows the system to change the communication security settings at runtime with the goal of improving node lifetime, yet providing a suitable security level. The optimization mechanism further improves energy consumption by putting in place a quality of service mechanism: when energy is scarce, the system tends to send only essential packets. As shown by the simulations presented in this paper, this mechanism optimizes the energy consumption among different recharges.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741696","Energy harvesting;Quality of services;Security;Wireless sensor networks;priority","Batteries;Energy consumption;Multiaccess communication;Optimization;Quality of service;Security;Wireless sensor networks","","","","0","","22","","","26-28 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which detection data is acquired at the leaves and is incrementally aggregated, reduced, and analyzed as it flows upward toward the root. Security management directives flow downward from nodes at the top. To maintain communications efficiency, the hierarchy is automatically reconfigured as needed using clustering techniques in which clusterheads are selected based on topology and other criteria.

Our technique defeats such attacks by monitoring all LIBC function and system-call invocations, and validating them against process-specific information that strictly prescribes the permissible behaviour for the program (unlike general sandboxing techniques that require manually maintained, explicit policies, we use the program code itself as a guideline for an implicit policy). Any deviation from this behaviour is considered malicious, and we halt the attack, limiting its damage to within the subverted process.

The method uses promiscuous mode of working along with rating and collaborative decision making based on multiple threshold values. All nodes join the network with an initial value of 1 for an honesty rate index, termed as h-rate. The h-rate of a node dynamically increases or decreases depending on its behavior. A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued. The proposed rule-based scheme reduces the h-rate of a node gradually, if it behaves abnormally. This provides an inherent mechanism against phantom intrusion detection. The h-rate may also be used for secure routing in MANET.","","978-0-7695-3184-7","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557846","IDS;MANET;attacks;collaborative decision making;neighborhood watch;private key","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;security of data","MANET;collaborative decision making;collaborative intrusion detection system;honesty-rate;mobile ad-hoc networks;multiple threshold values;packet forwarding;phantom intrusion detection;rule-based scheme","","4","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current integrity detection systems have some disadvantages, for example, they cannot protect themselves well or the dependence between the detection results and the target system is high. We refer to the problem as lack of transparency. This paper presents a novel online integrity checker, Block Tapping, which ensures its security benefiting from the isolation property of virtual machine. Block tapping monitors the block-level data streams transparently through block-to-file semantic-translation at the virtual block device layer. Based on the self-described information of virtual storages, Block Tapping detects the file-level malicious behaviors independent of the internal state of the compromised virtual machine. Experiments show that the prototype system successfully captures 13 typical user-mode root kit attacks against virtual storage, and the performance overhead is acceptable.","1521-9097","978-1-4577-1875-5","","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121331","Data Integrity;Transparent Detection;Virtual Storage","Databases;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes;Semantics;Synchronization;Virtual machining","data integrity;data privacy;file organisation;virtual machines;virtual storage","Xen-based computing platform;block-level data stream;block-to-file semantic-translation;blocktapping;file-level malicious behavior;online transparent integrity checker;virtual block device layer;virtual computing environment;virtual machine;virtual storage","","0","","23","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multihop communication between mobile devices may require specially designed routing algorithms for self-organised networks; those routing protocols can become primary targets for attacks. In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks. This study on security attacks and intrusion detection systems has led us to illustrate some of the particular security issues in WSoN.","2157-4952","978-1-4673-0228-9","978-1-4673-0227-2","10.1109/NTMS.2012.6208721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208721","","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CBR traffic;IDS;MANET;WSoN;black-hole attack;constant bit rate;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;malicious node;mobile device;multihop communication;on-demand routing protocol;packet delivery ratio;realistic traffic pattern;routing algorithm;routing attack;security attack;security problem evaluation;wireless self-organised network;wireless sensor network","","3","","15","","","7-10 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7","978-1-4244-0003-4","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first phase of the protocol, we design a trust based packet forwarding scheme for detecting and isolating the malicious nodes using the routing layer information. It uses trust values to favor packet forwarding by maintaining a trust counter for each node. A node is punished or rewarded by decreasing or increasing the trust counter. If the trust counter value falls below a trust threshold, the corresponding intermediate node is marked as malicious. In the next phase of the protocol, we provide link-layer security using the CBC-X mode of authentication and encryption. By simulation results, we show that the proposed MAC-layer security protocol achieves high packet delivery ratio while attaining low delay and overhead.","","978-1-4244-3708-5","978-1-4244-3709-2","10.1109/WICOM.2010.5600904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5600904","","Ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Radiation detectors;Security","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;telecommunication security","CBC-X mode;MAC layer security protocol;authentication;encryption;link-layer security;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;packet delivery;routing layer information;trust based security protocol;trust counter;trust threshold;trust values","","3","","11","","","23-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An automatic portscan detection system with adaptive threshold setting","Kim, Sang Kon; Lee, Seung Ho; Seo, Seung Woo","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science &#x0026; Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University, Korea","Communications and Networks, Journal of","20121220","2010","12","1","74","85","For the purpose of compromising hosts, attackers including infected hosts initially perform a portscan using IP addresses in order to find vulnerable hosts. Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners. We also show that the proposed system, including our scheme and algorithm, provides good performance in terms of the rate of false positi- es.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388436","Adaptive threshold setting;automatic portscan detection;false negative;false positive","Adaptive systems;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heating;IP networks;Real-time systems","","","","1","","19","","","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our methodology is based on two formal languages that describe different properties of a given attack. The first language, called a session signature, describes temporal relations between the attack events. The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant. We developed GARD, a tool for session-signature construction, and used it to construct session signatures for multi-step attacks. We show that a session signature is more accurate than existing signatures.","1081-6011","0-7695-2339-0","","10.1109/SP.2005.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425055","","Bridges;Formal languages;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Privacy;Protocols;Robustness;Security","computer network management;digital signatures;formal languages;programming language semantics;security of data","FTP attack;GARD;NIDS signature evaluation;attack invariant;formal languages;formal reasoning;language-based generation;multi-step attacks;network intrusion detection system;robust signatures;semantic properties;session-signature construction;temporal relations","","8","","36","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This assumption may be unreasonable in the context of attacks and intrusions. An intruder could compromise any number of the available copies of a service resulting in a false sense of security. The kernel based approaches have proven to be quite effective but they cause performance impacts if any code changes are in the critical path. We provide an alternate user space mechanism consisting of process monitors by which such user space daemons can be unambiguously monitored without causing serious performance impacts. A framework that claims to provide such a feature must itself be tamper-resistant to attacks. We theoretically analyze and compare some relevant schemes and show their fallibility. We propose our own framework that is based on some simple principles of graph theory and well-founded concepts in topological fault tolerance, and show that it can not only unambiguously detect any such attacks on the services but is also very hard to subvert. We also present some preliminary results as a proof of concept.","","0-7695-1886-9","","10.1109/IWIAS.2003.1192456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192456","","Availability;Computer displays;Computer network management;Computer science;Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Laboratories;Redundancy;Security;Voting","fault tolerant computing;graph theory;software reliability;system monitoring","graph theory;intruder detection;process monitors;tamper-resistant framework;topological fault tolerance;unambiguous attack detection;user space daemon monitoring;user space mechanism","","5","5","36","","","24-24 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides a complete check against a signature database, live introspection of all system calls is performed to detect yet unknown exploits or malware. Furthermore, to prevent that an intruder retains persistent control over a running instance after a successful compromise, an in-kernel root kit prevention approach is proposed.
