"Labeling Network Event Records for Intrusion Detection in aWireless LAN","Khoshgoftaar, T.M.; Seiffert, C.; Seliya, N.","Comput. Sci. & Eng., Florida Atlantic Univ., Boca Raton, FL","Information Reuse and Integration, 2006 IEEE International Conference on","20061204","2006","","","200","206","A data mining approach to network intrusion detection requires a training dataset of network event records labeled as either normal or an attack type. Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy","","0-7803-9788-6","","10.1109/IRI.2006.252413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490","","Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN","clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do that, we introduce two anomaly intrusion detection methods based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approaches outperform those used in [1].","","","","10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232998","Anomaly intrusion detection;Audit trail analysis;Intrusion detection;Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis;Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrices;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","data analysis;principal component analysis;security of data;vectors","KFDA;KPCA;anomaly intrusion detection method;data analysis method;discriminant factor;discrimination rule;kernel fisher discriminant analysis;kernel principal component analysis;vector","","0","","13","","","25-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the design and implementation of ontology-based knowledge representation for a peer-to-peer multi-agent distributed intrusion detection system (ontology-based MADIDS) are introduced. An example which demonstrates the representation of an attack with ontology and the relevant detection process is also presented. In ontology-Based MADIDS, ontology technique enables peers in the system and agents in one peer to share common understanding of information. In addition, benefited from agent technology and P2P architecture, agents in ontology-based MADIDS not only detect attacks on a single host but also in a distributed domain. These features make the ontology-based MADIDS more flexible and robust.","","978-0-7695-3354-4","","10.1109/NPC.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663312","Intrusion Detection;Multi-Agent;Ontology;Peer-to-Peer","Application software;Australia;Computer science;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Knowledge representation;Ontologies;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Software engineering","multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;security of data","knowledge representation;ontology;peer-to-peer multiagent distributed intrusion detection system","","0","","17","","","18-21 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SOCCA presents a new unified formalism to model the cyber-physical system including interconnections among cyber and physical components. The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity.

Finally, it applies an elaborate approach to detect NOP Sleds in the executable codes.

In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks.

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection. Simulation results show effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed architecture.","","978-1-4244-7837-8","978-0-7695-4158-7","10.1109/CICSyN.2010.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615975","Cluster;Denial of service attack;Intrusion detection;Security;Wireless ad hoc networks","","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;pattern clustering;protocols;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","centralized monitoring points;cluster heads;clustered wireless ad hoc networks;co-operative algorithms;distributed intrusion detection architecture;infrastructure protocols;intermittent wireless communications;intrusion related message communication;mobile agents;network security;node clustering","","2","","15","","","28-30 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM.

The limitation of information sources may lead a system to make inaccurate decisions. In this paper, we propose a Mobile Agent Based Peer-to-Peer Distributed Intrusion Detection Framework. Agents are included in this framework to achieve intrusion detections. In addition, a mobile agent migration strategy is applied in the framework to allow agents not only to collect information from direct-linked ""neighbours"" but also other hosts in the network.

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation. Our experimental results show that EliMet can optimally make use of prior knowledge as well as automated inference techniques to minimize human involvement and efficiently deduce the expert knowledge regarding individual states of that particular system.","1530-0889","978-1-4673-1624-8","978-1-4673-1623-1","10.1109/DSN.2012.6263941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263941","Power grid critical infrastructure;intrusion detection and response;security metric;situational awareness","Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Security","control engineering computing;inference mechanisms;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system protection;power system security","EliMet;automated inference techniques;bulk electricity delivery system;complex power-grid control network protection;power grid critical infrastructures;security assessment techniques;security incidents;security measures;security metric elicitation","","4","","42","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeypots are a tool supporting that task - they collect malware samples for analysis. Unfortunately, existing honeypots concentrate on malware that spreads over networks, thus missing any malware that does not use a network for propagation. A popular network-independent technique for malware to spread is copying itself to USB flash drives. In this article we present Ghost, a new kind of honeypot for such USB malware. It detects malware by simulating a removable device in software, thereby tricking malware into copying itself to the virtual device. We explain the concept in detail and evaluate it using samples of wide-spread malware.

The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the flooding attack by applying multiple nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) algorithm to identify the flooding attacker nodes. It also takes the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the flooding attack and after applying the proposed REHIDAN algorithm is tested. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN algorithm reduces the effect of the attack by reducing the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","","978-1-4244-4704-6","978-1-4244-3474-9","10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5010583","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay effects;Floods;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Testing","mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","dynamic network topology;flooding attack;on-demand distance vector routing protocol;real-time host intrusion detection;wireless ad-hoc networks","","2","","15","","","28-30 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies.

Our approach first extracts behavioral features to train classifiers using data mining techniques that can distinguish malicious and benign executables, and then host level agents are introduced to block the execution of malware instances with their content-based fingerprints. To increase accuracy, an algorithm is proposed that applies a classifier to raw audit data as well as observes the executions of malware in virtualized environments.

Such networks will not have a central manager; each node will manage itself and will be free to decide participation in any network function. As with traditional networks, these networks need to be secured to authenticate the nodes, prevent misuse, detect anomalies and protect user privacy. Network security and privacy protection without a central manager will be challenging. Several security mechanisms and privacy protections will require the cooperation of several nodes to defend the network from malicious attacks. We particularly investigate when for each node it is cost-effective to freely participate in the security mechanism or protect its privacy depending if that node believes or trusts that all other nodes or at least a minimum number of other nodes will do the same.

Although naive selfish strategies based on dropping data packets are readily detected, more sophisticated strategies that manipulate ad hoc routing protocols present a greater challenge. In this work we develop a method to distinguish selfish peers from cooperative ones based solely on local observations of AODV routing protocol behavior. Our approach uses the finite state machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build up a statistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We apply a series of well-known statistical tests to features derived from this description to partition the set neighboring nodes into a cooperative and selfish class. Simulation results for a non-mobile ad hoc network show that our approach can detect two different types of routing manipulation while maintaining a low rate of false positives.","1087-4089","0-7695-2509-1","","10.1109/ISPAN.2005.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1575855","","Ad hoc networks;Automata;Automatic testing;Bandwidth;Computer science;Data mining;Intelligent networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;finite state machines;routing protocols;statistical testing","AODV routing protocol;finite state machine;free-rider;nonmobile ad hoc network;reputation mechanism;selfish peer;selfish routing behavior;statistical description;statistical test","","5","","15","","","7-9 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed strategy maximizes the sum rate of the users allowing non-symmetric rates, while the optimal solution is explored with the aid of the Pareto frontier. The problem of relay selection is matched to a coalition formation game, where the relays and the CD cooperate to maximize their profit.

In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude. The results also show that the software implementation of our scheme without using any hardware parallelism can support up to one thousand customer VLANs and one million rules, where each rule consumes less than 60 bytes and each packet classification can be accomplished under 50 memory accesses.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.140112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689489","Packet classification;VLANs;datacenter network;firewalls;packet forwarding;router architectures;scalability","Data structures;Decision trees;Encoding;Hardware;IP networks;Indexes;Software","computer centres;firewalls;local area networks;telecommunication network routing;virtual machines","VLAN;classification rules;datacenter networks;encoded rule expansion;hardware parallelism;hash table;length combinations;packet classification;packet forwarding;storage penalty","","1","","48","","","January 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a precaution against potential attacks, a remote machine can take a proactive counter-strategy to deceive fingerprinters. This is done by normalizing or mystifying the distinguishing behaviors in the packets. However, the unified modification causes significant performance degradation to benign clients. Using a game-theoretic approach, we propose a selective and dynamic mechanism for counter-fingerprinting. We first model and analyze the interaction between a fingerprinter and a target as a signaling game. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategy profiles based on the information gain analysis. Based on our game results, we design DeceiveGame, a mechanism to prevent or to significantly slow down fingerprinting attacks. Our game-theoretic approach appropriately distinguishes a fingerprinter from a benign client and mystifies packets to confuse the fingerprinter, while minimizing the side effects on benign clients. Our performance analysis shows that DeceiveGame can reduce the probability of success of the fingerprinter significantly, without deteriorating the overall performance of other clients.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682694","","Conferences;Degradation;Fingerprint recognition;Games;IP networks;Probes;Security","Internet;computer network security;game theory;operating systems (computers)","DeceiveGame;Internet;Nash equilibrium;counter-fingerprinting;dynamic mechanism;game-theoretic approach;remote operating system fingerprinting;selective mechanism","","0","","19","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of any clear lines of defense. Most of the currently existing intrusion detection algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, inefficient, and have high rates of false positives. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully cooperative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966","","Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness","multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment","","2","","16","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator.

Pair-wise key establishment is one of the fundamental issues in securing WMNs. This paper presents a new matrix-based pairwise key establishment scheme for mesh clients. Our design is motivated by the fact that in WMNs, mesh routers are more powerful than mesh clients, both in computation and communication. By exploiting this heterogeneity, expensive operations can be delegated to mesh routers, which help alleviate the overhead of mesh clients during key establishment. The new scheme possesses two desirable features: (1) Neighbor mesh clients can directly establish pairwise keys; and (2) Communication and storage costs at mesh clients are significantly reduced.","1550-3607","","","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654744","Deployment knowledge;Matrix;Pairwise key;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Knowledge engineering;Security;Symmetric matrices;Wireless mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks","matrix algebra;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless mesh networks","WMN;adversarial activities;communication costs;deployment knowledge;eavesdropping;matrix-based pairwise key establishment scheme;mesh routers;neighbor mesh clients;security issue;storage costs;wireless mesh networks;wireless transmission","","1","","16","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is more difficult for network systems such as NIDS and Web Servers, because they must preserve flow order. But traditional flow-based load balancing schemes of network parallel processing systems, such as LLF, cost much resource and introduce lots of communication overhead. With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced. To make effective adjustments we design a new triggering policy based on waiting lengths and their difference.

Many security schemes have been proposed to identify misbehaving nodes. Most of these security schemes rely on either a predefined threshold, or a set of well-defined training data to build up the detection mechanism before effectively identifying the malicious peers. However, it is generally difficult to set appropriate thresholds, and collecting training datasets representative of an attack ahead of time is also problematic. We observe that the malicious peers generally demonstrate behavioral patterns different from all the other normal peers, and argue that outlier detection techniques can be used to detect malicious peers in ad hoc networks. A problem with this approach is combining evidence from potentially untrustworthy peers to detect the outliers. In this paper, an outlier detection algorithm is proposed that applies the Dempster-Shafer theory to combine observation results from multiple nodes because it can appropriately reflect uncertainty as well as unreliability of the observations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly resilient to attackers and it can converge stably to a common outlier view amongst distributed nodes with a limited communication overhead.","","978-1-4244-4153-2","978-0-7695-3650-7","10.1109/MDM.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5088926","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Detection algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Training data;Uncertainty;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;inference mechanisms;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;outlier detection;security","","9","","41","","","18-20 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999911","Android Malware;Android malware;Behavioral Analysis;Dynamic Analysis;Obfuscation;Static Analysis;Stealth Malwar;behavioral analysis;dynamic analysis;obfuscation;static analysis;stealth malware","Androids;Google;Humanoid robots;Malware;Smart phones;Tutorials","Android (operating system);application program interfaces;invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;smart phones","API;Android device;Android malware application;Internet;SMS;application programming interface;dynamic-analysis-based method;location-based service;malware detection techniques;malware penetration;multimedia services;next-generation Android security enforcement mechanism;office application;prevalent stealth techniques;signature-based analysis method;smartphone OS security;static analysis method;static analysis methods;vehicle guidance;voice call","","0","","143","","2014-12-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A second line of defense is required to provide intrusion detection and response techniques in protecting the OLSR protocol against attacks from inside intruders. In this paper, we describe security threats to the OLSR MANET routing protocol and present an intrusion detection solution based on protocol semantics checking. Our approach is based on semantic properties that are implied in the protocol definition and specify the correct OLSR routing update behavior. Conflict checking based on semantic properties is applied in every MANET node. Any abnormal protocol semantics triggers an intrusion alarm.

For this purpose, regular expressions are used, due to their high expressive power, and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) are adopted to match them. Many works have been proposed to improve DFAs, especially in terms of memory consumption and speed. Instead, we address another issue: the scalability of DFAs to parallel systems and their buffer requirements. To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted. This scheme is the first in literature that proposes effective parallelization of DFA walk, hence allowing for packet processing time reduction and less memory for reordering buffers. The result is that speed scales as the number of processing units.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-9266-4","978-1-4244-9267-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134010","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Instruction sets;Memory management;Multicore processing;Synchronization","buffer storage;deterministic automata;finite automata;inspection;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;pattern matching;performance evaluation;sampling methods;security of data","DFA parallelization;buffer reordering;buffer requirements;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;multicore systems;packet processing time reduction;parallel systems;regular expression matching performance;sampling technique;text expression","","0","","14","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","978-0-7695-4521-9","10.1109/ANCS.2011.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729","Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput","automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching","Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead","","1","","27","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since both protocols utilize 4-way handshaking, we propose a Merkle-tree based handshaking scheme, which is capable of improving the resiliency of the network in a situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack.

QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way.

Beijing, Beijing, China","Computer Network and Multimedia Technology, 2009. CNMT 2009. International Symposium on","20100108","2009","","","1","4","In this paper, we present a scalable dynamic key management scheme for wireless sensor networks in which new nodes can join a sensor network securely and compromised nodes can be isolated from the network in time. Unlike centralized and location-based key management schemes, our scheme doesn't depend on such infrastructure as base stations and robots. Thus, it possesses a higher degree of flexibility. By using a reasonable clustering algorithm, our scheme can integrate efficiently with the cluster-based intrusion detection scheme and can, hence, improve the whole security of a wireless sensor network. Analysis shows that our proposed scheme is low in computation, communication, and storage overhead.","","978-1-4244-5272-9","","10.1109/CNMT.2009.5374518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374518","","Clustering algorithms;Computer network management;Data security;Digital signatures;Elliptic curves;Engineering management;Intrusion detection;Isolation technology;Technology management;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;wireless sensor networks","cluster-based intrusion detection scheme;dynamic key management scheme;wireless sensor networks","","0","","8","","","18-20 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Eagle Eyes: Protocol Independent Packet Marking Scheme to Filter Attack Packets and Reduce Collateral Damage During Flooding Based DoS and DDoS Attacks","Saurabh, S.; Sairam, A.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Indian Inst. of Technol. Patna, Patna, India","Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT), 2012 Third International Conference on","20130110","2012","","","141","146","Defences against Denial and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks commonly responds to flooding by dropping excess traffic. Such rate limiting schemes drop all excess-traffic when the request arrival rate goes above a certain empirically calculated threshold. Flooding based DoS/DDoS attacks like TCP SYN Attack does not exhibit any special signature except that their arrival-rate is high enough to overwhelm the victim. Hence it is very difficult to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic as they share the same signature. As a result, rate limiting schemes cause heavy collateral damage by dropping out legitimate traffic [15]. In this paper we propose a novel packet marking mechanism which not only mitigates DoS/DDoS attacks by filtering but also reduces collateral damage significantly by selectively dropping attack packets based on its packet mark while allowing the legitimate traffic to be processed smoothly. Our packet mark contains fingerprint of the path in each single packet which allows us in identifying attack packets coming from various sources even in case of IP spoofing. Our scheme does not require any protocol specific knowledge and can generically filter out attack packets for all kinds of flooding attacks. We have extensively evaluated our packet marking scheme. Results show effectiveness of our scheme in filtering attack traffic. Our scheme inflicts extremely low collateral damage to legitimate traffic while quickly detecting and selectively filtering attack traffic.","","978-1-4673-3149-4","","10.1109/ICCCT.2012.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394683","Anomaly Detection;DDoS;TCP SYN Attack;collateral damage;packet marking;selective filtering","Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Limiting;Routing;Servers;Topology","IP networks;computer network security;protocols;telecommunication traffic","Eagle Eyes;IP spoofing;TCP SYN attack;attack packet filtering;attack traffic filtering;collateral damage reduction;distributed denial of service attacks;dropping attack packets;excess traffic dropping;flooding based DDoS Attacks;protocol independent packet marking scheme;rate limiting schemes","","0","","18","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Third International Conference on","20081118","2008","2","","1154","1158","Detecting network intrusion has been not only critical but also difficult in the network security research area. Traditional supervised learning techniques are not appropriate to detect anomalous behaviors and new attacks because of temporal changes in network intrusion patterns and characteristics. Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques such as SOM (self-organizing map) are more appropriate for anomaly detection. In this paper, we proposed a real-time intrusion detection system based on SOM that groups similar data and visualize their clusters. Our system labels the map produced by SOM using correlations between features. We experiments our system with KDD Cup 1999 data set. Our system yields the reasonable misclassification rates and takes 0.5 seconds to decide whether a behavior is normal or attack.","","978-0-7695-3407-7","","10.1109/ICCIT.2008.362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4682403","Correlations;Coutermeasures;Network Security;Real time Intrusion Detection System;Supervised Learning;Unsupervised Learning","Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Data visualization;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Neurons;Real time systems;Unsupervised learning","computer networks;real-time systems;self-organising feature maps;telecommunication security","feature correlation;intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection;network security;real-time system;self-organized map","","0","","15","","","11-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We review the existing threats in Java security and we rephrase the threats within OSGi service level. A rule-based control list and a threat detector are introduced to the OSGi framework. A software sensor is deployed in our design which detects service behaviors. The behaviors can be analyzed by the detector, which notifies the response manager to perform pre-defined rules. Malicious services that are harmful to other services or OSGi framework can be stopped so that other services work safely in the open environment.","","978-0-7695-2847-2","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4224156","","Access control;Computer crime;Detectors;Home automation;Information security;Intrusion detection;Java;Permission;Protection;Resource management","security of data","Java security;OSGi security layer;malicious services;open environment;response manager","","7","","18","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previously, many hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate regular expression matching using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) because FPGAs allow updating of new attack patterns. Because of the increasing number of attacks, we need to accommodate a large number of regular expressions on FPGAs. Although the minimization of logic equations has been studied intensively in the area of computer-aided design (CAD), the minimization of multiple regular expressions has been largely neglected. This paper presents a novel sharing architecture allowing our algorithm to extract and share common subregular expressions. Experimental results show that our sharing scheme significantly reduces the area of pattern matching circuits for regular expression.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2007.909801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378271","Finite automata;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);intrusion detection;pattern matching","Acceleration;Circuits;Design automation;Equations;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic design;Minimization;Pattern matching","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;minimisation;security of data","FPGA;attack patterns;computer-aided design;logic equations;minimization;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching circuits;regular expression matching;sharing architecture;subregular expressions","","22","14","19","","","Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
