IDS detects suspected patterns of network traffic on the remaining open parts through monitoring user activities (runtime gathering of data from system operations), and the subsequent analysis of these activities. The purpose of this work is to contribute ideas of finding a solution to detect attacks (intrusion) through building artificial detection system using feedforward neural networks to detect attacks with low false negative rate (which is the most important point), and low false positive rate. To do so, two feedforward neural networks architectures (one for non fuzzified data, the other for fuzzified data) are suggested, and their behaviors in detecting the attacks are studied. In this research, the suggested IDS not only has the ability to distinguish if the access is normal or attack, but also capable of distinguishing the attack type.","","978-1-4244-2799-4","978-1-4244-2800-7","10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5138399","Fuzzy set;Intrusion detection;Neural network","Artificial neural networks;Buildings;Data security;Feedforward neural networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Pattern analysis;Runtime;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;feedforward neural nets;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","artificial detection system;feedforward neural network;fuzzification;fuzzy set theory;intrusion detection system;low false negative rate;low false positive rate;network security;network traffic;pattern classification","","1","1","17","","","25-27 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, DTNs are vulnerable to insider attacks, in which the legitimate nodes are compromised and the adversary nodes launch blackhole attacks by dropping packets in the networks. The traditional approaches of securing routing protocols can not address such insider attacks in DTNs. In this paper, we propose a method to secure the history records of packet delivery information at each contact so that other nodes can detect insider attacks by analyzing these packet delivery records. We evaluated our approach through extensive simulations using both Random Way Point and Zebranet mobility models.

The existing work can only detect aggressive spreaders that scan a large number of distinct addresses in a short period of time. However, stealthy spreaders may perform scanning deliberately at a low rate. We observe that these spreaders can easily evade the detection because their small traffic footprint will be covered by the large amount of background normal traffic that frequently flushes any spreader information out of the intrusion detection system's memory. We propose a new streaming scheme to detect stealthy spreaders that are invisible to the current systems. The new scheme stores information about normal traffic within a limited portion of the allocated memory, so that it will not interfere with spreaders' information stored elsewhere in the memory. The proposed scheme is light weight; it can detect invisible spreaders in high-speed networks while residing in SRAM. Through experiments using real Internet traffic traces, we demonstrate that our new scheme detects invisible spreaders efficiently while keeping both false-positives (normal sources misclassified as spreaders) and false-negatives (spreaders misclassified as normal sources) to low level.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698181","","Detectors;Heart;Information science;Internet;Intrusion detection;Random access memory;Real time systems;Reconnaissance;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","SRAM chips;security of data","SRAM;background normal traffic;intrusion detection system;invisible spreaders;network security;real-time detection;traffic footprint","","0","","12","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, for the low frequency subband coefficients, we present a fusion rule based on the local entropy; while for the high frequency subband coefficients, a fusion rule based on the directional contrast combined with the local area energy is applied.

Along with the security measures that should be built into the smart grid from the beginning, appropriate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) should also be designed. Home area network (HAN) is one of the most vulnerable subsystems within the smart grid, mostly because of its physically insecure environment. In this paper, we present a layered specification-based IDS for HAN. Considering that ZigBee is the dominant technology in future HAN, our IDS is designed to target ZigBee technology; specifically we address the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. In our IDS the normal behavior of the network is defined through selected specifications that we extract from the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Deviations from the defined normal behavior can be a sign of some malicious activities. We further investigate the physical and MAC layer attacks in ZigBee networks and evaluate the performance of our proposed IDS against them. Our IDS provides a good detection capability against known attacks, and since this is an IDS based on anomalous event detection, we expect the same for unknown attacks.","","978-1-4577-1704-8","978-1-4577-1702-4","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102320","","IEEE 802.15 Standards;Jamming;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Security;Smart grids;Zigbee","Zigbee;access protocols;demand side management;home computing;power system security;security of data","ZigBee;anomalous event detection;home area networks;medium access control;physical control;smart grids;specification-based intrusion detection","","11","","17","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, summarized network connections from the DARPA 98 Lincoln Labs dataset are employed for training and testing a data driven learning architecture. The learning architecture is composed from a hierarchy of self-organizing feature maps. Such a scheme is entirely unsupervised, thus the quality of the intrusion detection system is directly influenced by the quality of the dataset. Dataset biases are investigated through three different dataset partitions: 10% KDD (default training dataset); normal connections alone; 50/50 mix of attack and normal.

In many ways outdoor security sensor technology can be described as “Slow-Tech” in a “High-Tech” world. In “High-Tech” we can expect a new product every few months with product lifetimes of one to two years. In the “Slow-Tech” world of outdoor security it typically takes two to three years to develop a new product and another two to three years to get the product approved by the user community. Fortunately once approved these products have a lifetime of ten to twenty years. The Carnahan Conference has provided an important venue for the introduction of new sensor technologies as they emerge from R&D, are tested by various agencies, and are introduced into the “real world” of outdoor security. The harsh realities of the outdoor environment and the wide range of threats faced by these sensors provide many challenges that have been the topic of many of the learned papers. The Carnahan conference provides an opportunity for the users of the technology to relate their experience to those who wish to introduce new technologies. Through the sponsorship of the IEEE these papers form a unique point of reference for the development of new sensors. Forty years ago most of the important players were large aerospace companies. Many of the sensor technologies used in perimeter security evolved from military developments. As one of the dominant users of perimeter security equipment, the US military sponsored much of this early development. This “mil-spec” environment had a profound effect on these developments which in many cases has survived to this day and is part of the heritage of the present world on outdoor perimeter security. These companies gave way to a number of small “spin-off” one product co- panies where the technologies were exploited. More recently most of one product companies have merged into larger “one-stop-shopping” companies. This paper describes the many changes in technology, the business models and the user community over the past 40 years and concludes with a prediction as to what the next 10 years will bring.","1071-6572","978-1-4673-2450-2","978-1-4673-2449-6","10.1109/CCST.2012.6393530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6393530","","Companies;Government;Industries;Military aircraft;Security;Sensor systems","military equipment;national security;sensors","Carnahan Conference;IEEE sponsorship;US military;VIP residents;aerospace companies;business models;critical assets;forty year perspective;high-tech world;mil-spec environment;military developments;one-stop-shopping companies;outdoor environment;outdoor perimeter security sensors;perimeter security equipment;sensor technology;slow-tech world;threats;user community","","0","","13","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm rate of AID techniques. To evaluate the effectiveness of the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies. The experimental results show that using the scheme, the intrusion contexts can be visualized and extracted from the audit trails correctly. In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis.

Consequently, it is difficult for administrators to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. Several alert correlation methods have been proposed. However, these methods don't consider the differences in reliability among alerts reported from multiple IDSs. This paper presents a novel alert correlation approach based on the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which regards the alerts as evidence of network attack and combines all the evidence according to the Dempster's combination rule, inferring whether the attack has taken place. The main advantage of the approach is that it can eliminate the ambiguity and confliction in alerts and reduce the number of alerts. With the DARPA 2000 test dataset, experimental results demonstrate that the approach can reduce more than 69% of reported alerts and decrease the false positive rate efficiently.","","978-1-4244-1009-5","978-1-4244-1009-5","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469406","D-S evidence theory;alert correlation;intrsion detection system;network security","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Correlation;Data security;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protection;Testing","computer networks;correlation methods;security of data;telecommunication security","Dempste combination rule;Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;intrusion alert correlation method;intrusion detection systems;network attack","","3","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the features selection is an important issue in intrusion detection. Reducing the features set improves the system accuracy and speeds up the training and testing phases considerably. In this paper, we improve the Enhancing Support Vector Decision Function (ESVDF) approach by integrate it with a fuzzy inferencing model. The fuzzy inferencing model is used to accommodate the learning approximation and the small differences in the decision making steps of the ESVDF approach. It simplifies the design complexity and reduces the execution time of the ESVDF, which speeds up the features selection processing and facilitates any modification or changes in the features selection process that may happen later. In addition, it improves the overall performance of the ESVDF. We have examined the feasibility of our approach by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can deliver a satisfactory performance in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing time.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-4000-9","978-0-7695-3638-5","10.1109/AINA.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076245","","Computer networks;Computer vision;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;System testing","approximation theory;decision making;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines","decision making;enhancing support vector decision function;feature set reduction;features selection;fuzzy ESVDF approach;fuzzy inference model;intrusion detection system;machine learning approximation;testing phase;training phase","","3","","28","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the use of MAC layer traffic data to characterize normal behaviors in the neighborhood of a mobile node, and to detect misbehaving nodes through MAC layer anomalies. In particular, we evaluate and select a set of features from MAC layer to profile normal behaviors of mobile nodes, and then we apply cross-feature analysis on feature vectors constructed from training data according to the proposed feature set. We are able to reliably detect MAC layer anomalies, some of which may be in fact caused by misbehavior of network layer, since most routing attacks directly impact MAC layer operations.

We formulate the tradeoff as an optimization problem for dynamically determining the best redundancy level to apply to multipath routing for intrusion tolerance so that the query response success probability is maximized while prolonging the useful lifetime. Furthermore, we consider this optimization problem for the case in which a voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm is applied to detect and evict malicious nodes in a HWSN. We develop a novel probability model to analyze the best redundancy level in terms of path redundancy and source redundancy, as well as the best intrusion detection settings in terms of the number of voters and the intrusion invocation interval under which the lifetime of a HWSN is maximized. We then apply the analysis results obtained to the design of a dynamic redundancy management algorithm to identify and apply the best design parameter settings at runtime in response to environment changes, to maximize the HWSN lifetime.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.043013.120282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514999","Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;energy conservation;intrusion detection;multipath routing;reliability;security","Energy conservation;Intrusion detection;Multipath channels;Network sensors;Routing protocls;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor management","energy consumption;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","HWSN;dynamic redundancy management algorithm;energy consumption;heterogeneous wireless sensor network;intrusion tolerance;multipath routing;optimization problem;query response success probability;security;voting-based distributed intrusion detection algorithm","","4","","40","","2013-05-13","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By the abilities of classification and clustering analysis of the above methods, IIDS can be adapted to both anomaly and misuse detections for intrusive outsiders. The training stage is a mixture of supervised manner and unsupervised one. Furthermore, IIDS uses the buffering and spoofing principles of address resolution protocol (ARP) to capture and refuse the insider intruders trying to log on a local area network (LAN). Therefore, IIDS is able to detect the intrusions/attacks both from the outer Internet and an inner LAN.

We propose CAPTRA, a coordinated packet traceback mechanism, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that takes advantage of the broadcasting nature of the packet transmissions. By remembering packets in multi-dimensional Bloom filters distributed in overhearing sensors and later retrieving the information, CAPTRA identifies the path of the packet transfers using a series of REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message exchanges between the forwarding and overhearing nodes. CAPTRA requires only small memory footprint on the sensors due to the usage of Bloom filters, and allows sensors to asynchronously refresh the Bloom filters so that the network traffic is continuously monitored. CAPTRA is simulated using J-Sim, and a few key parameters are tuned for the best tracing performance","","1-59593-334-4","","10.1109/IPSN.2006.244130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662453","Bloom filter;Wireless sensor networks;packet traceback","Broadcasting;Data mining;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","broadcasting;filters;information retrieval;packet radio networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","CAPTRA;IDS;REQUEST-VERDICT-CONFESS message;WSN;broadcasting;coordinated packet traceback mechanism;information retrieval;intrusion detection system;multidimensional Bloom filter;network traffic;packet transmission;persistent attack;sporadic attack;wireless sensor network","","4","","30","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce an IDS alert correlator, which we call Extrusion Detection Guard (EDGe), to detect infected hosts within a monitored network from IDS alerts. EDGe detects several malware that exhibit a multi-stage behavior and it can identify the family and even variant of certain malware, which helps to remediate and prioritize incidents. Our validation based on manual real-time analysis of a sample of detected incidents shows that only 15% of the detected infections are false positives. In addition, we compare EDGe with a state-of-the-art previous work and show that EDGe finds 60% more infections and has a lower number of false positives. A large part of this paper focuses on characterizing 4,358 infections (13.4 new infections per day) detected with EDGe from a unique dataset of 832 million IDS alerts collected from an operational network over a period of 9 months. Our characterization shows that infections exhibit spatial correlations and attract many further inbound attacks. Moreover, we investigate attack heavy hitters and show that client infections are significantly more bursty compared to server infections. Finally, we compare the alerts produced by different malware families and highlight key differences in their volume, aliveness, fanout, and severity.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901257","Intrusion detection;alert correlation;malware;malware measurements;snort","Grippers;Image edge detection;Monitoring;Servers;Trojan horses","invasive software","EDGe;ETH Zurich campus network;IDS alert correlation;Snort IDS;extrusion detection guard;intrusion detection systems;malware","","0","","36","","2014-09-17","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In cluster based IDS, feature vectors generated from network traffic are grouped into clusters as normal or abnormal (raising alert). The main cause for false alert generation is either, technique fails to differentiate an outlier from a genuine cluster point or the features extracted fail to separate the two classes. In this work, fuzzy clustering technique for anomaly intrusion detection has been explored to reduce the false alarms.

Due to special characteristics of these networks, security issue is a difficult task to achieve. Hence, applying current intrusion detection techniques developed for fixed networks is not sufficient for MANETs. In this paper, we proposed an approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial immune system (AIS), called GAAIS, for dynamic intrusion detection in AODV-based MANETs. GAAIS is able to adapting itself to network topology changes using two updating methods: partial and total. Each normal feature vector extracted from network traffic is represented by a hypersphere with fix radius. A set of spherical detector is generated using NicheMGA algorithm for covering the nonself space. Spherical detectors are used for detecting anomaly in network traffic. The performance of GAAIS is evaluated for detecting several types of routing attacks simulated using the NS2 simulator, such as Flooding, Blackhole, Neighbor, Rushing, and Wormhole. Experimental results show that GAAIS is more efficient in comparison with similar approaches.","","978-1-4799-3350-1","","10.1109/IranianCIS.2014.6802607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802607","Ad hoc network;Artificial immune system;Genetic algorithm;Intrusion detection;Routing attack","Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing protocols;Vectors","artificial immune systems;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;mobile ad hoc networks;security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AIS;AODV-based MANET;GA;NS2 simulator;NicheMGA algorithm;artificial immune system;blackhole simulator;dynamic intrusion detection technique;flooding simulator;genetic algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;neighbor simulator;network topology;network traffic;normal feature vector extraction;routing attack simulation;rushing simulator;security;spherical detector;wireless mobile node;wormhole simulator","","0","","13","","","4-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) curtails the amount of data to be compared by reducing their dimensions prior to classification that results in reduction of detection time. In this paper, PCA is adopted to reduce higher dimension dataset to lower dimension dataset. It is accomplished by converting network packet header fields into a vector then PCA applied over high dimensional dataset to reduce the dimension. The reduced dimension dataset is tested with Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), J48 Tree algorithm, Random Forest Tree classification algorithm, Adaboost algorihm, Nearest Neighbors generalized Exemplars algorithm, Navebayes probabilistic classifier and Voting Features Interval classification algorithm.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5198832","","Communications Society;Computerized monitoring;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Operating systems;Paper technology;Training data","hidden Markov models;operating system kernels;security of data","HIDS;HMM;anomaly detection;hidden Markov model;host-based intrusion detection system;maximum realizable ROC technique;operating system kernel;receiver operating characteristics;system call","","4","","17","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, and lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. A distributed intrusion detection approach based on timed automata is given. A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then the timed automata is constructed by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of dynamic source routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify the behaviour of every nodes by timed automata, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, the approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness. Finally, the intrusion detection method is evaluated through simulation experiments.","","","","10.1016/S1004-4132(08)60163-2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6072389","intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;routing protocol;security;timed automata","Automata;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols","","","","1","","","","","Aug. 2008","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

Computer vision extends the image processing paradigm to include understanding of scene content, tracking and object classification.

Due to improve the performance of existing intrusion detection methods which are implemented in the kernel of operating system, this paper focuses on the negative selection algorithm using maximum entropy model to avoid the degeneration caused by the valueless repetition of system calls.

The feature selection methods are analyzed on parameters like accuracy, number of features selected out of total features, time taken, TP rate and FP rate. The result shows that almost same level of accuracy can be achieved by reducing number of features considerably which also takes less computational time to detect threats. Filtered subset evaluation comes out to be best technique which suggests only 17.07 % of total features.

Detection rate (DR) and false alarm (FA) are influenced by radius of Detectors. Large radiuses would increase both DR and FA and small radiuses would decrease them, so selecting appropriate quantity plays an important role for achieving high accuracy in recognition. The radius of detectors is determined based on self-environment. The radius of self-region spheres has straight effect on detectors radiuses and is an important parameter to achieve high accuracy.

Due to the nature and deployment realities of the protocol (ASCII message representation, most deployments over UDP, limited use of message encryption), it becomes relatively easy to attack the protocol at the message level. To mitigate this, self-learning systems have been proposed to counteract new threats. However the efficacy of existing machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Existing literature indicates that Euclidean distance based classifiers work well to detect anomalous messages. Our work suggests that such classifiers do not produce adequate results for well-crafted malicious messages that differ very slightly from normal messages. To demonstrate this, we gather SIP traffic and minimally perturb it using 13 generic transforms to create malicious SIP messages. We use the Levenshtein distance, L, as a measure of similarity between normal and malicious SIP messages. We subject our dataset - consisting of malicious and normal SIP messages - to Euclidean distance-based classifiers as well as four standard classifiers. Our results show vast differences for Euclidean distance-based classifiers on our dataset than reported in current literature. We further see that the standard classifiers are better able to classify an anomalous message when L is small.","","978-1-4244-9219-0","978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990708","","Fires;Grammar;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Routing protocols","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);signalling protocols;telecommunication traffic","ASCII message representation;Euclidean classifiers;Internet;Levenshtein distance;SIP messages;UDP;anomalous message detection;machine learning algorithms;message encryption;multimedia session establishment protocol;self-learning systems;self-similar session initiation protocol","","3","","17","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design an intrusion prevention system to realize the source-end defense method. The packets are categorized into three types: normal, suspicious and attack packets. The attack packets are blocked before they enter the Internet. The bandwidth of the suspicious packets is restricted and the IP header is attached with a signature made by their edge router. When a victim confirms the suspicious packets with an attack action, it finds out the source of the attack by the signature on the packets and then informs their edge router to block such packets.","","978-1-4244-1272-3","978-1-4244-1272-3","10.1109/TENCON.2007.4428862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4428862","","Bandwidth;Computer crashes;Computer crime;Internet;Law;Legal factors;Lungs;Nuclear electronics;Power engineering and energy;Spine","Internet;bandwidth allocation;security of data","IP header;Internet;distributed denial of service;edge router;intrusion prevention system;network bandwidth;source-end defense;systems resources","","0","","22","","","Oct. 30 2007-Nov. 2 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new framework for real-time alert correlation which consists of two phases: Alert Preprocessing Phase and Scenario Constructing Phase. In our structure, we aggregate alerts into graph structures and then we extract unknown attack scenarios with mining frequent structure patterns. This method is based on the observation that most alerts have frequent and sequential characteristic, since we can use frequent item set mining methods for extracting attack scenarios. Our algorithm is efficient in memory and time consumption. For evaluation of our algorithm we used DARPA2000 dataset.

Building effective IDSs, unfortunately, has remained an elusive goal owing to the great technical challenges involved; and applied AI techniques are increasingly being utilized in attempts to overcome the difficulties. This paper presents a comparative study of using support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and linear genetic programs (LGPs) for intrusion detection. We investigate and compare the performance of IDSs based on the mentioned techniques, with respect to a well-known set of intrusion evaluation data gathered by Lincoln Labs. Through a variety of experiments and analysis, it is found that, with appropriately chosen population size, program size, crossover rate and mutation rate, LGPs outperform other techniques in terms of detection accuracy at the expense of time.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) deliver an extra layer of security that cannot be guaranteed by built-in security tools. IDS provide the ideal solution to defend databases from intruders. In this paper, we suggest an anomaly detection approach that summarizes the raw transactional SQL queries into compact data structure called hexplet, which can model normal database access behavior (abstract the user's role profile) and recognize impostors specifically tailored for role-based access control (RBAC) database system. This hexplet allows us to preserve the correlation among SQL statements in the same transaction by exploiting the information in the transaction-log entry. Our target is to improve detection accuracy, specially the detection of those intruders inside the organization who behave strange behavior. Our model utilizes Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) as a simple technique for evaluating the legitimacy of transaction.

To exclusively discriminate illegitimate nodes, we propose a method of using multiple and multiple-angle measurements of a Wi-Fi network nodepsilas signal strength. In this paper we present a real time unsupervised analysis method for identifying duplicate Wi-Fi network nodes which are physically separate.

It is also not enough to detect already-known intrusions, yet-unseen attacks or variations of those known present a real challenge in the design of these systems.

DAIS isolates likely suspicious actions before a definite determination of intrusion is reported. In this way, the database can be immunized from many malicious transactions. DAIS is a COTS-DBMS-specific implementation of a general isolation algorithm that was developed previously (P. Liu et al., 2000). The design of the first DAIS prototype, which is for Oracle Server 8.1.6, is discussed. DAIS uses triggers and transaction profiles to keep track of the items read and written by transactions, isolates attacks by rewriting user SQL statements, and is transparent to end users. The DAIS design is very general. In addition to Oracle, it can be easily adapted to support many other database application platforms such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, and Informix.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991538","","Data security;Database systems;Face detection;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Prototypes;Real time systems;Transaction databases","SQL;authorisation;data integrity;database management systems;fault tolerant computing;real-time systems;transaction processing","COTS-DBMS-specific implementation;DAIS;Informix;Microsoft SQL Server;Oracle;Oracle Server;Sybase;authorized malicious transactions;commercial database applications;data attacks;database application platforms;database security mechanisms;end user transparency;first DAIS prototype;general isolation algorithm;integrity;intrusion tolerance;likely suspicious actions;malicious transactions;real-time data attack isolation system;transaction profiles;user SQL statements","","3","","33","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples include buffer overflow attacks, flooding attacks, system break-ins, etc. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a key role in detecting such malicious activities and enable administrators in securing network systems. Two key criteria should be met by an IDS for it to be effective: (i) ability to detect unknown attack types, (ii) having very less miss classification rate. In this paper we describe an adaptive network intrusion detection system, that uses a two stage architecture. In the first stage a probabilistic classifier is used to detect potential anomalies in the traffic. In the second stage a HMM based traffic model is used to narrow down the potential attack IP addresses. Various design choices that were made to make this system practical and difficulties faced in integrating with existing models are also described.

In order to detect selective forwarding attack effectively, we propose the sequential mesh test based detection scheme in this paper. The cluster head node detects the packet drop nodes based on the sequential mesh test method after receiving the packet drop reports. This scheme extracts a small quantity of samples to run the test, instead of regulating the total times of test in advance. It decides whether continue the test or not based on the test result until it obtains the final conclusion. We show through experiments that our scheme can provide a higher detection accurate rate and a lower false alarm rate than the existing detection scheme.

This is in spite of the fact that many networks run some type of security mechanism at their connection to the Internet. Large enterprise networks, such as the network for a major university, are very inviting targets to hackers who are looking to exploit networks. Large enterprise networks may consist of many machines running numerous operating systems. These networks normally have enormous storage capabilities and high speed/high bandwidth connections to the Internet. Due to the requirements for academic freedom, system administrators are restricted in what requirements they can place on users on these networks. The high bandwidth usages on these networks make it very difficult to identify malicious traffic within the enterprise network. We propose that a Honeynet can be used to assist the system administrator in identifying malicious traffic on the enterprise network. By its very nature, a Honeynet has no production value and should not be generating or receiving any traffic. Thus, any traffic to or from the Honeynet is suspicious in nature. Traffic from the enterprise network to a machine on the Honeynet may indicate a compromised enterprise system.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232406","","Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;authorisation;bandwidth allocation;business communication;computer crime;message authentication;network operating systems;system monitoring;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Honeynets;Honeypots;Internet;bandwidth requirement;computer crime;computer network;exploited system detection;hacking;intrusion detection;large enterprise network;malicious traffic identification","","28","16","16","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem is approached statistically, as that of sequential (quickest) changepoint detection. A multi-cyclic setting of quickest change detection is a natural fit for this problem. We propose a novel score-based multi-cyclic detection algorithm. The algorithm is based on the so-called Shiryaev-Roberts procedure. This procedure is as easy to employ in practice and as computationally inexpensive as the popular Cumulative Sum chart and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average scheme. The likelihood ratio based Shiryaev-Roberts procedure has appealing optimality properties, particularly it is exactly optimal in a multi-cyclic setting geared to detect a change occurring at a far time horizon. It is therefore expected that an intrusion detection algorithm based on the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure will perform better than other detection schemes. This is confirmed experimentally for real traces. We also discuss the possibility of complementing our anomaly detection algorithm with a spectral-signature intrusion detection system with false alarm filtering and true attack confirmation capability, so as to obtain a synergistic system.","1932-4553","","","10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2233713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6380529","CUSUM;Changepoint detection;Shiryaev–Roberts Procedure;TCP SYN attacks;cybersecurity;distributed denial-of-service attacks;intrusion detection;network traffic","Computer networks;Computer security;Delay;Detection algorithms;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Tin","computer network security","Shiryaev-Roberts procedure;alarm filtering;attack confirmation capability;changepoint detection method;computer network anomaly detection;computer network traffic;cumulative sum chart;exponentially-weighted moving average scheme;likelihood ratio;multicyclic setting;online anomaly detection;score-based multicyclic detection algorithm;sequential changepoint detection;spectral-signature intrusion detection system;synergistic system","","3","","27","","2012-12-12","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to reduce the damage worms may cause, existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) need to be adaptive to the security-related requirements of their monitoring networks. This paper presents a Multilevel security based Autonomic Parameter Selector (MAPS) that can be implemented over any existing IDSs. The deployment architecture consists of a number of hierarchically placed local security managers, metropolitan security managers, and a global security manager. These security managers report events to a worm advisory system (WAS). WAS accordingly sets the threat level of the network. Based on this level, MAPS selects the most optimum parameters for the entire IDS to combat against the propagating worm. The MAPS architecture maintains the system performance by constantly evaluating three metrics, namely False Negative Avoidance, False Positive Avoidance, and performance overhead. Extensive experiments, using real network traffic and a recently proposed worm detection system, demonstrate that MAPS is capable of advising an IDS with optimum parameter values to effectively and promptly hinder further propagation of worms.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","1-4244-0357-X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150932","","Computerized monitoring;Data security;Frequency;Humans;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Optical propagation;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;invasive software","Internet worms;false negative avoidance;false positive avoidance;intrusion detection systems;multi-level security based autonomic parameter selection;performance overhead;security managers;worm advisory system","","0","","11","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

No knowledge is made of internal data structures of the target anomaly detector, only the anomaly rate reported by the detector. Such a ldquoblack boxrdquo methodology enables a vulnerability testing approach where both open-source and commodity anomaly detection systems can be tested.

Due to the propagation speed of worms, reactive defenses need to be automatic. It is important to understand where and how these defenses need to fit in the network so that they cannot be easily evaded. As there are several mechanisms malcode authors can use to bypass existing perimeter-centric defenses, this position paper argues that substantial defenses need to be embedded in the local area network, thus creating ""hard-LANs"" designed to detect and respond to worm infections. When compared with conventional network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), we believe that hard-LAN devices need to have two orders of magnitude better cost/performance, and at least two orders of magnitude better accuracy, resulting in substantial design challenges.","","0-7803-8686-8","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375206","","Communication system control;Computer aided software engineering;Computer worms;Costs;Humans;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Payloads;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;local area networks;telecommunication security","automatic reactive defenses;hard-LAN;local area network;malcode authors;network IDS;network intrusion detection systems;network worms;perimeter-centric defenses;propagation speed;self-propagating network programs","","6","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
