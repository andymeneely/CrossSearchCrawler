Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152Î¼ seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","0","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many situations, these algorithms give increased performance such as better detectability and/or reduced false alarm rates. To achieve these benefits, typically some system or signal model is given. This work focuses on the situation where the event signal is unknown and a false alarm criterion must be met. Specifically, the case where data from multiple passive infrared (PIR) sensors are processed to detect intrusion into a room while satisfying a false alarm constraint is analyzed. The central challenge is the space of intrusion signals is unknown and we want to quantify analytically the probability of false alarm. It is shown that this quantification is possible by estimating the background noise statistics and computing the Mahalanobis distance in the frequency domain. Using the Mahalanobis distance as the decision metric, a threshold is computed to satisfy the false alarm constraint.","","","","10.1109/SAS.2015.7133634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133634","","Frequency-domain analysis;Gaussian distribution;Noise;Noise measurement;Principal component analysis;Sensor fusion;Time series analysis","frequency-domain analysis;infrared detectors;probability;safety systems;security of data;sensor fusion;signal detection;statistics","Mahalanobis distance;PIR sensor;background noise statistics;false alarm probability constraint;frequency domain analysis;intrusion detection;multiple passive infrared sensor;sensor fusion algorithm","","1","","14","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the incident investigation, Intelligence gathering is the first phase of such attacks. To evade detection, hacker may make use of botnet, a set of zombie machines, to gain the access of a target and the zombies send the collected results back to the hacker. Even though the zombies would be blocked by detection system, the hacker, using the access information obtained from the botnet, would login the target from another machine without being noticed by the detection system. Such information gathering tactic can evade detection and the hacker grants the initial access to the target. The proposed defense system analyzes multiple logs from the network and extracts the reconnaissance attack sequences related to targeted attacks. State-based model is adopted to model the steps of the above early phase attack performed by multiple scouts and an intruder and such attack events in a long time frame becomes significant in the state-aware model.

When a deviation from this normal behavior is detected, an alert is raised. This anomaly approach, unlike the misuse approach, is able to detect unknown attacks. A basic technique to build such a model for a program is to use the system call sequences of the process. To improve the accuracy and completeness of this detection model, we can add information related to the system call, such as its arguments or its execution context. But even then, attacks that target non-control-data may be missed and attacks on control-data may be adapted to bypass the detection mechanism using evasion techniques. We propose in this article an approach that focuses on the detection of non-control-data attacks. Our approach aims at exploiting the internal state of a program to detect a memory corruption on non-control-data that could lead to an illegal system call. To achieve this, we propose to build a data-oriented detection model by statically analyzing a program source code. This model is used to instrument the program by adding reasonableness checks that verify the consistent state of the data items the system calls depend on. We thus argue that it is possible to detect a program misuse issued by a non-control-data attack inside the program during its execution. While keeping a low overhead, this approach allows to detect non-control-data attacks.","2151-4763","978-1-4244-4498-4","978-1-4244-4499-1","10.1109/CRISIS.2009.5411977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5411977","","Context modeling;Control systems;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Protection;Software tools","data handling;security of data","SIDAN tool;anomaly based intrusion detection system;data oriented detection model;detection model accuracy;detection model completeness;noncontrol data attacks detection;noncontrol data memory corruption;program internal state;program source code analyzation;software instrumentation","","1","","25","","","19-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to identify the attack scenarios is one of the challenges in many research fields, such as cyberspace security situation awareness, the detection of APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and so on. Alert correlation analysis based on causal knowledge is one of the widely adopted methods in CEP (Complex Event Processing), which is a promising way to identify multi-step attack processes and can reconstruct attack scenarios. However, current researches suffer from the problem of defining causal knowledge manually. In order to solve this problem, we propose an approach of mining for causal knowledge automatically based on the Markov property in this paper. Firstly, the raw alert stream is clustered into several alert sets, then each set is mined in order to obtain the one step transition probability matrix based on the Markov property, and after being generated, each matrix represents a piece of causal knowledge. Then we fuse the knowledge which has overlapping steps to create the knowledge base of attack patterns. Finally the experimental results show that this approach is feasible.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945304","alert correlation;attack scenario;causal knowledge;data mining","Correlation;Cyberspace;Data mining;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Markov processes;Sensors","Markov processes;data mining;matrix algebra;probability;security of data","APT detection;CEP;Markov property;advanced persistent threat detection;alert correlation analysis;attack scenarios;causal knowledge discovery;complex event processing;cyberspace security situation awareness;data mining;multistep attack processes;one step transition probability matrix;raw alert stream","","0","","21","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, intruders perform their attacks through a sequence of intermediary hosts before attacking the target. This type of attack is known as a ""stepping-stone attack"". Stepping-stone detection is to determine if a host machine is being used as a stepping-stone by attackers. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for stepping-stone detection using a pervious mapping-based detection method. The technique reduces the detection problem to finding a mapping between two streams of packets. If our algorithm cannot find the mapping, then no such mapping exists. But if there is a mapping, then the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find one and the solution will always be the one with minimum indexed. We provide the proof of the correctness of the algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithm has a low time complexity.

In this work, we design an FPGA-based architecture for anomaly detection in network transmissions. We first develop a feature extraction module (FEM) which aims to summarize network information to be used at a later stage. Our FPGA implementation shows that we can achieve significant performance improvements compared to existing software and application-specific integrated-circuit implementations. Then, we go one step further and demonstrate the use of principal component analysis as an outlier detection method for NIDSs. The results show that our architecture correctly classifies attacks with detection rates exceeding 99% and false alarms rates as low as 1.95%.

Instead of analyzing one time series for overall traffic, random aggregation of flows is used to investigate a fixed number of time series for grained analysis. Least mean square filter is used to predict the next value of the time series based on previous values, and Pearson Chi- square divergence is used to measure the deviations between the current and estimated probability distributions.

However, suitable detection models use in honeypot system have not been fully explored. We present HonIDS, a honeypot system for detecting malicious hosts and intruders in local network. HonIDS is characterized by its layered structure and is enhanced by two detection models: TFRPP (times, frequency, range, port risk, average payload length) model and Bayes model. The basic idea of these models is that although it is hard to directly judge whether one interaction with the honeypots is an attack or malicious activity, it is possible to identify intruders by analyzing the plentiful and global events of honeypots in a given period of time. The TFRPP model gives the honeypot system the ability to assess different risks, by assigning dubiety scores to the hosts who visited honeypots. The Bayes detection model can detect some main types of attacks by classification. The results of our evaluation experiments indicate that TFRPP model and Bayes model are effective and suitable for honeypot system","","0-7695-2564-4","","10.1109/IWIA.2006.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1610006","","Computer science;Event detection;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Noise generators;Payloads;Probes;Research and development;Security;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;local area networks;security of data;telecommunication security","Bayes detection model;HonlDS;classification;detective function;honeypot system;intruder identification;intrusion detection system model;local network intruder detection;malicious activity;malicious host detection;risk assessment","","4","","21","","","13-14 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper uses the unsupervised K-MEANS algorithm to model and detect anomaly activities. The aim is to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. A K-MEANS algorithm based on information entropy (KMIE) is proposed to detect anomaly activities. KMIE can filter the outliers on the dataset to reduce the negative impact, and indentify the initial cluster centers using entropy method. Then, KMIE can use these centers to iterative calculate and classify records into different clusters. This paper uses KDD CUP 1999 dataset to test the performance of KMIE algorithm.

System calls and the operating system related information are used by host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) to detect intrusions towards a host. However, the relationship between hardware architecture events and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks has not been well revealed. When increasingly sophisticated intrusions emerge, some attacks are able to bypass both the application and the operating system level feature monitors. Therefore, a more effective solution is required to enhance existing HIDSs. In this paper, we identify the following hardware architecture features: instruction count, cache miss, bus traffic and integrate them into a novel HIDS framework based on a modern statistical gradient boosting trees model. Through the integration of application, operating system and architecture level features, our proposed HIDS demonstrates a significant improvement of the detection rate in terms of sophisticated DoS intrusions.","","978-1-4244-2769-7","","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925084","","Application software;Boosting;Computer crime;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Radio access networks;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","architecture level features;hardware architecture;network-based intrusion detection systems;operating system;sophisticated denial-of-service attack detections;statistical gradient boosting trees model","","0","","23","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an IDS solution correlating attack symptoms from diverse information sources, which are collected at different architectural levels, and particularly the network, the DBMS, and the application level.

One important hypothesis of this type of detection is: different user exhibits different behavior in their online activities. The user behavior can be captured and compared. The efficiency of AIDS relies on the quality of the training data. Many prior studies encounter the problem of low hit rates and high false alarms. In this paper, we study the relationship between the user behavior in terms of operating system commands and the success rate of detection. We first used the principal component analysis (PCA) to select the commands that are highly effective in distinguishing users. Then we use these commands to classify users into categories.

Most host-based intrusion detection systems involve building some sort of reference models offline, usually from execution traces (in the absence of the source code), to characterize the system healthy behavior. The models can later be used as a baseline for online detection of abnormal behavior. Perhaps the most popular techniques are the ones based on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM). These techniques, however, require long training time of the models, which makes them computationally infeasible, the main reason being the large size of typical traces. In this paper, we propose an improved HMM using the concept of frequent common patterns. In other words, we build models based on extracting the largest n-grams (patterns) in the traces instead of taking each trace event on its own. We show through a case study that our approach can reduce the training time by 31.96%-48.44% compared to the original HMM algorithms while keeping almost the same accuracy rate.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364527","Behavioral modeling;HMM;Host-based Anomanly Detection Systems;N-gram extraction algorithm","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Training","hidden Markov models;security of data","HMM algorithms;execution traces;frequent common patterns;host-based intrusion detection techniques;improved hidden Markov model;n-grams;online detection;reference models;software system safety;software system security;system healthy behavior","","2","","30","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, it has become increasingly important to find new ways to implement and manage intrusion detection systems. Evolutionary-based systems offer the ability to adapt to dynamic environments and to identify unknown attack methods. Fuzzy-based systems accommodate the imprecision associated with mutated and previously unidentified attack modes.

Similarly, 'â' quantifies information gain or loss as the change in the number of false alarms generated by a misuse detection system when feature-extracted data is used instead of original data. We present two neural network methods for feature extraction: (1) NNPCA and (2) NLCA for reducing the 41-dimensional KDD Cup 1999 data. We compare our methods with principal component analysis (PCA).

Mathematical transformation algorithms have proven effective at interpreting multilingual, unstructured data, but high computational requirements of such algorithms prevent their widespread use. The rate of computation can be vastly increased with field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware. To experiment with this approach, we developed a system with FPGAs that ingests content over a network at high data rates. The system extracts basewords, counts words, scores documents, and discovers concepts on data that are carried in TCP/IP network flows as packets over a Gigabit Ethernet link or in cells transported over an OC48 link. These algorithms, as implemented in FPGA hardware, introduce certain constraints on the complexity and richness of the semantic processing algorithms. To understand the implications of these constraints and to benchmark the performance of the system, we have performed a series of experiments processing multilingual documents.

The alert verification module adopts a novel rule learning based mechanism which analyzes the change of system behavior caused by an intrusion to determine whether an attack succeeded and therefore lower the number of false alarms. In this framework, the host behavior is not represented by a single user or program activity; instead, it is represented by a set of factors, called behavior set, so that the host behavior can be described more accurately and completely","","0-7695-2772-8","","10.1109/ECBS.2007.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4148961","","Change detection algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Data mining;Face detection;Humans;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Telecommunication traffic","formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","alert verification;anomaly detection;behavior analysis-based learning;clustering algorithm;intrusion detection;machine learning;rule learning based mechanism","","2","","16","","","26-29 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To better defend these PoIs, the design of the bistatic radar network is investigated in two stages. First, we study the problem of optimally placing a number of radar transmitters and receivers in the sense of minimizing the maximum distance product between a PoI and its closest transmitter-receiver pair. For this problem, we propose a randomized Voronoi algorithm. Next, given the radars' locations, assuming that the transmitters use fixed and orthogonal frequencies to illuminate signals for interference avoidance, we study the problem of frequency selection for the receivers. Since an intelligent attacker can adaptively change the PoI to attack, the receivers should dynamically adapt their frequencies to cover different subsets of the PoIs. Accordingly, we model the dynamic interactions between the bistatic radar network and the attacker as a repeated security game. Based on their respective information, we propose two learning algorithms for each of them, respectively. We show that if both players follow the modified-regret-matching procedures, the empirical distributions of their actions converge to the set of correlated equilibria.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2013.011713.120892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416889","Bistatic radar network;learning algorithm;node placement;repeated game;security game","Bistatic radar;Games;Receivers;Security;Transmitters;Vectors","","","","0","","21","","2013-01-22","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the traditional detection method cannot meet actual demands. Applying wavelet neural network (WNN) to intrusion detection has become a research focus recently, but some inherent defects in WNN reduce its efficiencies in operation and identification. Aiming at eliminating these limitations, we propose a new improved WNN algorithm basing on genetic algorithm (GA). This new algorithm combines WNN with GA in order to optimize network parameters and improve network performance. Making use of the actual data extracted from the intrusion detection system, this paper tests the newly constructed algorithm emulationally. The results show that used in intrusion detection, the new algorithm has higher identification rate and it can increase network running efficiency and the success rate of training. Thereby it can reduce undetected rate and false alarm rate. Thus it proves the validity of the new algorithm.","","978-1-4244-4638-4","978-1-4244-4639-1","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5302607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302607","","Biological neural networks;Computer network management;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Helium;Information security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Neurons;Transfer functions","genetic algorithms;neural nets;security of data","GA-based WWN intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;identification rate;network running efficiency;network security;wavelet neural network","","0","","13","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The task of traffic identification is a complex task due to the constantly changing Internet and an increase in encrypted data. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as port-based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications use random ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes an Optimized Hybrid Model (OHM) that makes use of a rule-based model (Apriori) along with a self-organizing map (SOM) model to tackle the problem of traffic classification without making use of the payload or ports. The proposed method also allows the generation of association rules for new unknown applications and further labeling by experts. Besides that, a optimizer called Firefly Algorithm was also used to enhance the results by optimizing both Apriori and SOM parameters and a comparative study was performed on both optimized and non-optimized models. The OHM showed to be superior to a non-optimized model for both eMule and Skype applications, reaching levels superior to 94% for correctness rate. The OHM was also validated against another model based on computational intelligence, named Realtime, and the OHM proposed in this work presented better results when tested in real time.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6755057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755057","Association Rules;Firefly Algorithm;Network Traffic Measurement;Self-Organizing Maps","Association rules;Computational modeling;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Real-time systems;Training","Internet;computer network management;cryptography;data mining;evolutionary computation;pattern classification;self-organising feature maps","Apriori;DPI;Internet;OHM;Realtime computational intelligence;SOM;Skype;association rules;deep packet inspection;eMule;encrypted data;firefly algorithm;hybrid model;network traffic classification;network traffic identification;optimized hybrid model;port-based inspection;rule-based model;self-organizing map;traffic volume","","1","","24","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing and commercial IDS are generally centralized and suffer from a number of drawbacks, e.g., high rates of false positives, low efficiency, etc, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel mobile agent-based intrusion detection system focusing on the misuse detection approach, called DIDMAS (Distributed Intrusion Detection using Mobile Agents and Snort). DIDMAS takes advantages of the mobile agent paradigm to implement an efficient distributed system, as well as the integration of existing techniques, i.e., the well-known IDS SNORT.

However, they tend to show good performance on off-line data and their accuracy drop when they are deployed to realtime intrusion detection systems that receive data streams constantly. In other words, the problem with a conventional classifier model, when applied to realtime detection systems, is that it is likely to perform poorly against new data that is different from the patterns against which the model was trained. This work presents an adaptive classification framework for a realtime intrusion detection system that changes its behavior according to the patterns occurred in the new received data. The performance of the system is constantly monitored and whenever it drops under a certain level of accuracy, the classifier model is retrained to learn new patterns and eliminate the obsolete ones from its knowledge. Further, the framework uses a semi rule-based approach to classification in order to make the model more understandable for human experts and facilitate the user interference in the learning process.","","978-1-4673-1420-6","","10.1109/CYBER.2012.6392538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392538","","Accuracy;Association rules;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;user interfaces","adaptive classification framework;classification algorithm;classifier model;cyberinfrastructure;cybersecurity;data mining method;incremental semi rule-based learning model;realtime intrusion detection system;user interference","","0","","13","","","27-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, it is very difficult to find a real origin of attackers because DoS/DDoS attacker uses spoofed IP addresses. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic route selection algorithm to trace the attacker's real origin. This algorithm uses three types of packets such as an alert packet, an agent packet and a reply agent packet. The alert packet is in use to notify to a victim that DDoS attacks occur. The agent packet is in use to find the attacker's real origin and the reply agent packet is in use to notify to a victim that the agent packet is reached the edge router of the attacker. When source-end detector and victim-end detector detect attacks, the victim-end detector sends the alert packet to the victim. The victim received the alert packet generates the agent packet and sends it to a victim's edge router. The attacker's edge router received the agent packet generates the reply agent packet and send it to the victim. The agent packet and the reply agent packet is forwarded refer to probabilistic packet forwarding table by routers. The probabilistic route selection algorithm runs on the distributed routers and probabilistic packet forwarding table is stored and managed by routers. We simulate for the propose of validation this algorithm by using OPNET14.0 in terms of false positive and required number of packets to trace DDoS attack traffic source.","","978-1-4244-9222-0","978-1-4244-9223-7","10.1109/ICISA.2011.5772420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5772420","","Computer crime;IP networks;Image edge detection;Internet;Logic gates;Probabilistic logic;Watermarking","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;probability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack traffic source;DoS attack;Internet;OPNET14.0;agent packet;alert packet;distributed denial of service;probabilistic packet forwarding;probabilistic route selection algorithm;reply agent packet;source-end detector;spoofed IP addresses;victim-end detector","","0","","7","","","26-29 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After biological immune principles are introduced, the corresponding distributed intrusion detection model is described in detail. With the detector set generated by evolutionary negative selection algorithm, the immune agents can evolve to adapt to the change of intrusion patterns according to the real circumstance. Therefore the anomaly changes in large non-self space can be detected by the immune agents with relatively small detector sets.

Specifically, we present the recent advances on security threats/attacks and countermeasures in CRNs focusing more on the physical layer by categorizing them in terms of their types, their existence in the CR cycle, network protocol layers (exploited during their activities and defense strategies), and game theoretic approaches. The recent important attacks and countermeasures in CRNs are also summarized in the form of tables.

It is, however, currently abused in various ways. Tor exit routers are frequently troubled by administrative and legal complaints. To gain an insight into such abuse, we designed and implemented a novel system, TorWard, for the discovery and the systematic study of malicious traffic over Tor. The system can avoid legal and administrative complaints, and allows the investigation to be performed in a sensitive environment such as a university campus. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to discover and classify malicious traffic. We performed comprehensive analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard. Our results show that around 10% Tor traffic can trigger IDS alerts. Malicious traffic includes P2P traffic, malware traffic (e.g., botnet traffic), denial-of-service attack traffic, spam, and others. Around 200 known malwares have been identified. To mitigate the abuse of Tor, we implemented a defense system, which processes IDS alerts, tears down, and blocks suspect connections. To facilitate forensic traceback of malicious traffic, we implemented a dual-tone multi-frequency signaling-based approach to correlate botnet traffic at Tor entry routers and that at exit routers. We carried out theoretical analysis and extensive real-world experiments to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of TorWard for discovery, blocking, and traceback of malicious traffic.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2465934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182328","Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Traffic;Tor;intrusion detection system;malicious traffic","Bandwidth;Law;Logic gates;Malware;Protocols;Servers","computer network security;digital forensics;invasive software;law;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","IDS alerts;P2P traffic;Tor exit routers;TorWard;administrative complaints;botnet traffic;denial-of-service attack traffic;dual-tone multifrequency signaling-based approach;forensic traceback;intrusion detection system;legal complaints;low-latency anonymous communication system;malicious traffic traceback;malware traffic;spam;suspect connections;university campus","","0","","55","","2015-08-07","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a stat- based approach to measuring intrusion impacts on the basis of IDS reports, and analyzing costs and benefits of response polices supposed to be taken. Specifically, assuming the system evolves as a Markov process conditioned upon the current system state, imperfect observation and action, a partially observable Markov decision process to model the efficacy of IDSs (as well as alert correlation technology) as providing a probabilistic assessment of the state of system assets, and to maximize rewards (cost and benefit) by taking appropriate actions in response to the estimated states.

This paper present IDS based on Flexible Neural Trees. Flexible neural tree is hierarchical neural network, which is automatically created using evolutionary algorithms to solving of defined problem.

In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid-the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)-where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks. AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection.

These signatures are not descriptions of exploits, but instead are descriptions of the program conditions that lead to the exploitation of software vulnerabilities, i.e., they depend on the structure of the vulnerabilities themselves. A program vulnerability is generally induced by the execution of a combination of program statements. In this work we first analyze the execution profiles of a subject application in order to identify such suspicious combinations and consequently extract and define their corresponding signatures. Then, we insert probes in select locations in the application to enable online signature matching. To evaluate our technique, we implemented it for Java programs and applied it on Tomcat 3.0 in order to detect well-known attacks. Our results were promising, as no false negatives and a maximum of 4.5% false positives were observed, and the runtime overhead was less than 5%.","","978-1-4244-3725-2","","10.1109/IWSESS.2009.5068454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5068454","","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Conferences;Databases;Intrusion detection;Java;Pattern matching;Probes;Runtime","Java;digital signatures;program diagnostics;security of data","Java programs;Tomcat 3.0;execution profiles;intrusion detection system;malicious behavior;online signature matching;program analysis;program statements;security mechanism;signature extraction;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","26","","","19-19 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server. Our emulated Minos systems running Linux and Windows have stopped several actual attacks. We present a microarchitectural implementation of Minos that achieves negligible impact on cycle time with a small investment in die area, and minor changes to the Linux kernel to handle the tag bits and perform virtual memory swapping.","1072-4451","0-7695-2126-6","","10.1109/MICRO.2004.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1550996","","Computer science;Control systems;Counting circuits;Hardware;Internet;Kernel;Libraries;Linux;Microarchitecture;Protection","","","","64","30","36","","","04-08 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach is able to transform high-dimensional feature vectors into a low-dimensional domain. The similarity between new incoming packets and a normal profile is determined using Euclidean distance on the simple, low-dimensional feature domain.

However, since it still suffers from detecting an unknown attack, i.e., 0-day attack, the ultimate challenge in intrusion detection field is how we can exactly identify such an attack. Unlike the existing approaches that investigate raw traffic data, we introduced a feature extraction method in order to detect such an attack from IDS alerts [J. Song et al., 2007]. However, there is a problem that it can be only applied to limited IDS products. In this paper, we present a generalized version of the feature extraction method. To this end, we define new 7 features using only the basic 6 features of IDS alerts; detection time, source address and port, destination address and port, and signature name. In order to detect 0-day attack from IDS alerts with new 7 features, we apply an unsupervised learning technique, One-class SVM, to them. We evaluated our method over the log data of IDS that is deployed in Kyoto University, and our experimental results show that it has capability to detect not only a type of 0-day attack detected in our previous study, but also several different types of 0-day attack.","","978-0-7695-3297-4","","10.1109/SAINT.2008.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604543","","Computer security;Data security;Feature extraction;Informatics;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic;Unsupervised learning","feature extraction;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication security;unsupervised learning","0-day attack detection;cyber attacks;generalized feature extraction;intrusion detection system alerts;one-class SVM;raw traffic data;support vector machines;unknown attack detection;unsupervised learning","","5","","23","","","July 28 2008-Aug. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a testbed framework to simulate attacks that enables to study a wide range of security scenarios. The framework provides a notion of real-world arrangements, yet it retains full control over all the activities performed within the simulated infrastructures. Utilizing the sandbox environment, it is possible to simulate various security attacks and evaluate their impacts on real infrastructures. The design of the framework benefits from IaaS clouds.

A small number of malicious users can cause problems that affect a large number of users; more often, by not following proper procedures a user may let his/her system be used by malicious users; and there are various other misuses that all leave the network in a state of the tragedy of the commons. In this paper, we introduce the concept of credit-based networking - borrowing ideas from financial management and adapting them to network management. We first focus on a campus network by studying concrete scenarios of how credit-based network management can be applied. We then discuss how the concept is generally applicable to managing network behaviors as well by applying it to managing ISP peering relationships. We argue that the cascading effect of credit-based network management can enhance network management efficiency and improve the global network environment we all live in.","","978-1-4244-2912-7","978-1-4244-2913-4","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808889","","Computer network management;Concrete;Environmental management;Financial management","computer network management;security of data;telecommunication security","ISP peering relationships;cascading effect;computer network administrator;credit based networking;credit-based network management;financial management;global network environment;malicious users;network management efficiency;user behavioral problems","","0","","10","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel NSSA framework is presented. The framework includes two parts: calculate the Network Security Situation Value (NSSV) and discover intrusion processes. NSSA quantitative assesses the impact on network security caused by attacks upon Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and hierarchical network structure. Based on attack classification, intrusion processes discover the process how network security is affected.

Based on some improved dynamic clonal selection algorithms, an adaptive intrusion detection algorithm is presented in this paper. According to the algorithm, an intrusion detection system is composed of a self-body antigen set, a memorial immunocyte set, a mature immunocyte set and an immature immunocyte set. An immature immunocyte grows into a mature one if it goes through self-tolerance. A mature immunocyte grows into a memorial one if it matches enough non-self-body antigens in limited time and it goes through co-stimulation. A memorial immunocyte doesn't die until it can't go through co-stimulation. Immature immunocytes are generated with clone and hypermutation methods when necessary. The self-body antigen set is renewed during above co-stimulation. Simulation experiments prove that the algorithm have good adaptability and diversity","","0-7695-2528-8","","10.1109/ISDA.2006.253760","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021812","costimulation.;dynamic clonal selection algorithm;immature immunocyte generation algorithm;intrusion detection","Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Cloning;Computer architecture;Genetic mutations;Heuristic algorithms;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Satellites","security of data","adaptive intrusion detection;computer immunology;dynamic clonal selection algorithms;immature immunocyte;mature immunocyte;memorial immunocyte;self-body antigen","","0","","7","","","16-18 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the high data rate coupled with complex detection can cause the capacity of the fault tolerance system to be exhausted resulting in low detection accuracy. We present a new stateful detection mechanism which observes the exchanged application messages, deduces the application state, and matches against anomaly-based rules. We extend our previous framework (the monitor) to incorporate a sampling approach which adjusts the rate of verified messages. The sampling approach avoids the previously reported breakdown in the monitor capacity at high application message rates, reduces the overall detection cost and allows the monitor to provide accurate detection. We apply the approach to a reliable multicast protocol (TRAM) and demonstrate its performance by comparing it with our previous framework.","1060-9857","0-7695-2995-X","","10.1109/SRDS.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365703","","Application software;Computer errors;Costs;Distributed computing;Electric breakdown;Fault detection;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Sampling methods;Throughput","computer network reliability;electronic messaging;error detection;fault tolerant computing;multicast protocols;sampling methods;telecommunication security","anomaly-based rule;fault tolerance system;high throughput distributed system;message exchange;reliable multicast protocol;sampling approach;stateful error detection","","2","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
