This hybrid system combines the advantages of low false-positive rate of signature-based intrusion detection system (IDS) and the ability of anomaly detection system (ADS) to detect novel unknown attacks. By mining anomalous traffic episodes from Internet connections, we build an ADS that detects anomalies beyond the capabilities of signature-based SNORT or Bro systems. A weighted signature generation scheme is developed to integrate ADS with SNORT by extracting signatures from anomalies detected. HIDS extracts signatures from the output of ADS and adds them into the SNORT signature database for fast and accurate intrusion detection. By testing our HIDS scheme over real-life Internet trace data mixed with 10 days of Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) attack data set, our experimental results show a 60 percent detection rate of the HIDS, compared with 30 percent and 22 percent in using the SNORT and Bro systems, respectively. This sharp increase in detection rate is obtained with less than 3 percent false alarms. The signatures generated by ADS upgrade the SNORT performance by 33 percent.

Software vulnerability may jeopardize information confidentiality and cause software failure leading tocatastrophic threats to humans or severe economic losses. Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats. This paper is divided into two parts. It examines promising search based testing approaches to detecting software vulnerabilities, and then presents some of the most interesting open research problems.","","978-1-4244-4356-7","","10.1109/ICSTW.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976374","high dependability software;search based software testing;vulnerability exposure","Application software;Computer security;Costs;Data security;Humans;Production;Software performance;Software safety;Software systems;Software testing","data privacy;program testing;security of data","code breaking;computerized system security;cost-vulnerability problem;information confidentiality;pervasive problem;search based software testing;software failure;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","70","","","1-4 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy. We show the effectiveness of PBC when applying it to a large dataset.","","978-1-4673-7988-5","","10.1109/QRS.2015.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272921","Anomaly Detection Systems;Boolean Combination;Intrusion Detection Systems;Multiple-Detector Systems;Pruning Techniques","Accuracy;Boolean functions;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Monitoring;Probability distribution;Training","Boolean algebra;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS;PBC;anomaly detection system;intrusion detection system;machine learning technique;pruning Boolean combination;pruning technique","","","","","","","3-5 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These techniques build intrusion detection models adaptively. Random forests is an efficient data mining algorithm which can be used for network intrusion detection This can be used for real time intrusion detection.

However, the open architecture of WMNs paves way to malicious attackers who can exploit hidden loopholes in the routing protocol. In this paper, we mainly focus on the vulnerability of the network to a suction attack called blackhole attack. In detecting such attacks, we explore the use of intelligent agents called honeypots which are roaming virtual software agents that generate a dummy route request (RREQ) packets to lure and trap blackhole attackers. We illustrate the performance of our proposed detection approach by extensive simulation results using the ns-2 simulator.","","978-1-4244-5113-5","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336925","AODV;Blackhole;Honey pots;Malicious;Spoofed;Wireless Mesh Networks","Computer crime;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Relays;Routing protocols;Software agents;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless mesh networks","Internet;internetworking;radio networks;routing protocols;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","Internet gateway;blackhole attack detection;cooperatively relay;dummy route request;intelligent honeypot agent;routing protocol;static mesh router;virtual software agent;wireless mesh network","","6","","21","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a hierarchical VANETs intrusion detection system based on BUSNet is present. BUSNet is basically a virtual mobile backbone infrastructure that is constructed using public buses. We use the bus nodes as the cluster-heads to gather the routing control messages and data packets transmitted among the vehicles. The bus nodes first transmit the original network behavior information to the access points deployed along the road sides. Then the access points can get a global view of the VANETs, and we can detect anomaly behaviors through analyzing the data. The anomaly detection method is based on the neural network which can build the normal network behavior model through learning process. After the trained neural network is stable, it can monitor the VANETs security by detecting the network control message and data packet in real time and alarm immediately if there is anomaly behavior. The experiments in NS2 show that the detection method can detect anomaly behavior with low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-5821-9","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497798","","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Neural networks;Routing;Spine;Spread spectrum communication;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;neural nets;packet radio networks;security of data;system buses;telecommunication network routing;vehicles","BUSNet;NS2;VANET;data packet;dynamic topology;intrusion detection system;learning;multihop cooperative routing;neural network;routing control;vehicular ad hoc networks","","1","","25","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To analyze and design detection and defense mechanisms for CPSs requires new system frameworks. In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge. The paper illustrates these concepts using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously known designs.","","978-1-4799-7746-8","","10.1109/CDC.2014.7039433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7039433","","Algorithm design and analysis;Control systems;Detectors;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Security;Stochastic processes","security of data;stochastic games","CPS;Nash equilibrium strategies;attackers;control cost;cyber state;cyber-physical systems;defense mechanisms;defense policies;detection mechanisms;detection mode;moving-horizon hybrid stochastic game model;physical states;saddle-point equilibrium policy;secure control;switching strategies;system dynamics;system frameworks;system security overhead;zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growing popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) increases the risk of wireless security attacks. A fake AP can be set in any public space in order to impersonate legitimate APs for monetization. Existing fake AP detection methods analyze wireless traffic by using extra devices, and the traffic is collected by servers. However, using these server-side methods is costly and only provide secure communication, in limited places, of clients' devices. Recently, several fake AP detection methods have been designed in order to overcome the server-side problems in a client-side. However, there are two limitations to the client-side methods: cumbersome processes and limited resources. When the methods attempt to collect data, calculating interval time incurs time-consuming processes to detect fake characteristics in the client-side. Moreover, the operating systems in smartphones provide limited resources that can hardly be adopted in the client-side. In this paper, we propose a novel fake AP detection method to solve the aforementioned problems in the client-side. The method leverages received signal strengths (RSSs) and online detection algorithm. Our method collects RSSs from nearby APs and normalizes them for accurate measurement. We measure the similarity of normalized RSSs. If the similarity between normalized RSSs is less than the fixed threshold value, we determine that the RSSs are generated from a fake device. We can measure the optimal threshold value derived from the sequential hypothesis testing. In our experiment, when the fixed threshold value was 2, the true positive was over than 99% and the false positive was less than 0.1% in three observations.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-0989-9","978-1-4673-0988-2","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240312","","Clocks;Communication system security;Portable computers;Servers;Testing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","mobile handsets;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","WLAN;client devices;client-side methods;fake AP detection;fake access points;normalized RSS;online detection algorithm;optimal threshold value;received signal strengths;sequential hypothesis testing;server-side methods;smartphone users;time-consuming processes;wireless local area networks;wireless security attacks;wireless traffic","","5","","15","","","6-9 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","4","2","47","","2009-08-11","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this reason, most existing intrusion detection techniques have not met the requirements for practical deployment. In this paper, the authors proposed a theoretical basis for intrusion detection to argue about their principles and to analyze the existing problems for intrusion detection in a quantified manner. The root causes of these problems are identified as model inaccuracy and model incompleteness as well as the distinguishability lack in the features utilized. In addition, it is also found that static analysis (Wagner, et al., 2001), with a properly selected feature vector, is a promising intrusion detection technique in principle because it can avoid the quality issue of its behavior models.","","0-7803-9290-6","","10.1109/IAW.2005.1495951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495951","","Access control;Authentication;Computational efficiency;Computer applications;Face detection;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Power system modeling","digital signatures;feature extraction;program diagnostics","anomaly-based intrusion detection;behavior model;feature vector;information security infrastructure;model inaccuracy;model incompleteness;signature-based intrusion detection;static analysis","","4","1","27","","","15-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units.

However, realising a network of physical objects accessed through the Internet brings a potential threat in the shadow of the numerous benefits. The threat is “security”. Given that Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) leverage the potential of IoT quite efficiently, this paper faces the challenge of security attention on a particular, yet broad, context of IP-enabled WSNs. In particular, it proposes a novel threat visualisation tool for such networks, called VisIoT. VisIoT is a human-interactive visual-based anomaly detection system that is capable of monitoring and promptly detecting several devastating forms of security attacks, including wormhole attacks, and Sybil attacks. Based on a rigorous, radial visualisation design, VisIoT may expose adversaries conducting one or multiple concurrent attacks against IP-enabled WSNs.

The multiattribute IDS comprises a heterogeneous white list and behavior-based concept in order to make SCADA cybersystems more secure. This paper also proposes a multilayer cyber-security framework based on IDS for protecting SCADA cybersecurity in smart grids without compromising the availability of normal data. In addition, this paper presents a SCADA-specific cybersecurity testbed to investigate simulated attacks, which has been used in this paper to validate the proposed approach.","0885-8977","","","10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2300099","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737311","Cybersecurity;intrusion detection;smart grid;supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)","Computer security;Current measurement;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Protocols;SCADA systems","SCADA systems;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","IDS;SCADA cybersystems;behavior-based concept;cyber-attack threats;heterogeneous white list;multiattribute SCADA-specific intrusion detection system;multilayer cyber-security framework;power system networks;smart grids;supervisory control and data acquisition systems","","5","","23","","2014-02-11","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes. Moreover, it achieves close to the linear speedup by improving the intrusion detection and false alarm rates.","","978-1-4799-0453-2","978-1-4799-0452-5","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557670","","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Particle swarm optimization;Testing;Vectors","computer network security;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering","MapReduce intrusion detection system;anomaly fragments discover;commodity hardware;computer networks;false alarm rates;initial cluster centroids;large data sets;particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm;premature convergence;sensitivity problem","","2","","20","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic idea behind IMS is convergence; providing a single interface to different traditional or modern networking architectures allowing better working environment for the end users. IMS is still not commercially adopted and used but research is in progress to explore it. IMS is an IP based overlay next generation network architecture. It inherent number of security threats of session initiation protocol (SIP), TCP, UDP etc as it uses SIP and IP protocols. Some of them can degrade the performance of IMS seriously and may cause DoS or DDoS attacks. The paper presents a new approach keeping a vision of secure IMS based on intrusion detection system (IDS) using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) as classifier. The KNN classifier can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate. It can distinguish between the normal behavior of the system or abnormal. In this paper, we have focused on the key element of IMS core known as proxy call session control function (PCSCF). Network based anomaly detection mechanism is proposed using KNN as anomaly detector. Experiments are performed on OpenIMS core and the result shows that IMS is vulnerable to different types of attacks such as UDP flooding, IP spoofing that can cause DoS. KNN classifier effectively distinguishes the behavior of the system as normal or intrusive and achieve low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-2823-6","978-1-4244-2824-3","10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4777775","3GPP;DoS;IDS;IMS;KNN;PCSCF","Computer crime;Convergence;Degradation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Next generation networking;Protocols;Quality of service;TCPIP","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;pattern classification;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","3GPP;IP multimedia subsystem;IP protocols;IP spoofing;OpenIMS core;TCP;UDP flooding;intrusion detection system;k-nearest neighbor classifier;overlay next generation network architecture;proxy call session control function;quality of service;session initiation protocol","","1","","29","","","23-24 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detections systems are becoming more and more sophisticated to detect such attacks. However, more advanced detection techniques require more complicated analyses, e.g, sequential analysis, which incurs detection latency. If we have an intrusion detection system as a filter for all system inputs, we introduce a uniform processing latency to all transactions of the database system. In this paper, we propose to use a ""unsafe zone"" to isolate user's SQL queries from a ""safe zone"" of the database. In the unsafe zone, we use polyinstantiations and flags for the records to provide an immediate but different view from that of the safe zone to the user. Such isolation has negligible processing latency from the user's view, while it can significantly improve the integrity level of the whole database system and reduce the recovery costs. Our techniques provide different integrity levels within different zones. Both our analytical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our isolation techniques against data corruption attacks to the databases.

So they can 't satisfy the IDS evaluation requirement in highspeed network environment. After analyzing the requirement of IDSs evaluation and the characteristics of network traffic, this paper proposes a differential equation model of active flow rate.

To address such security challenges, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to detect the malicious attackers before they can accomplish any significant damages to the network. The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report. A new key exchange mechanism called Instant Key Generation Mechanism (IKGM) is introduced here to eliminate the predistributed keys requirement.

In this paper, we use a centroid-based technique for network intrusion detection in which the centroid is constructed on the basis of diversity. Diversity of a point is the sum of the distances from a point to all other points in a cluster. The point having minimum diversity is chosen as a centroid. The performance of diversity-based centroid shows significant improvement in the classification of intrusions.

In the same trend, the number and typologies of vulnerabilities exploiting these services and communication channels have increased as well. Therefore, smartphones may now represent an ideal target for malware writers. As the number of vulnerabilities and, hence, of attacks increase, there has been a corresponding rise of security solutions proposed by researchers. Due to the fact that this research field is immature and still unexplored in depth, with this paper we aim to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on security solutions for mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art on threats, vulnerabilities and security solutions over the period 2004-2011, by focusing on high-level attacks, such those to user applications. We group existing approaches aimed at protecting mobile devices against these classes of attacks into different categories, based upon the detection principles, architectures, collected data and operating systems, especially focusing on IDS-based models and tools. With this categorization we aim to provide an easy and concise view of the underlying model adopted by each approach.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2012.013012.00028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170530","Intrusion Detection;Mobile Malware;Mobile Security;Trusted Mobile","Bluetooth;Malware;Mobile communication;Network security;Smart phones;Trojan horses","invasive software;smart phones;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing","IDS-based models;communication channels;malware writers;mobile devices;mobile services;security;smart phones;ubiquitous services","","20","","165","","2012-03-15","First Quarter 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because of their dynamic ad hoc nature, in which unknown devices develop spontaneous interactions between themselves, these networks are particularly vulnerable to various security threats. In recent years considerable efforts have been made to design secure and robust routing protocol, and many security schemes have been proposed to tackle these security issues. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of security threats in MANET. In particular, we examine all routing threats that can target the operation of routing protocol, whether they belong to selfish behaviors or malicious attacks, as well as countermeasures against such attacks. In order to analyze the existent countermeasures in a structured manner we have classified them into three classes; solutions based on cryptography; intrusion detection systems; and trust management and reputation-based solutions.","","978-1-4673-6421-8","","10.1109/UKSim.2013.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6527503","Mobile ad hoc networks;countermeasures;malicious;security threats;selfish","Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;cryptography;dynamic topology;intrusion detection system;malicious attack;mobile ad hoc network;reputation-based solution;routing protocol;security threat;self-organizing mobile node;trust management","","1","","27","","","10-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these techniques only consider the relationship between system calls (or system audit events). We first refine the definition of maximal patterns given in (Wespi et al., 2000) and provide a pattern extraction algorithm to identify such maximal patterns. We then add one additional dimension to the problem domain by also taking into consideration the overlap relationship between patterns. We argue that an execution path of an application is usually not an arbitrary combination of various patterns; but rather, they overlap each other in some specific order. Such overlap relationship characterizes the normal behavior of the application. Finally, a novel pattern matching module is proposed to detect intrusions based on both intra-pattern and inter-pattern anomalies. We test this idea using the data sets obtained from the University of New Mexico. The experimental results indicate that our scheme detects significantly more anomalies than the scheme presented in (Wespi et al., 2000) while maintaining a very low false alarm rate.","","0-7695-1754-4","","10.1109/ICDM.2002.1184017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1184017","","Application software;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Testing;Windows","Unix;data mining;pattern matching;security of data;very large databases","UNIX;data mining;data sets;experimental results;false alarm rate;inter-pattern anomalies;intra-pattern anomalies;intrusion detection;maximal patterns;pattern extraction algorithm;pattern matching module;system calls","","6","","10","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Efficient NIDS can be developed by defining a proper rule set for classifying network audit data into normal or attack patterns. Generally, each dataset is characterized by a large set of features, but not all features will be relevant or fully contribute identifying an attack. Since different attacks need different subsets to have better detection accuracy, this paper describes an improved feature selection algorithm to identify most appropriate subset of features for a certain attack. The proposed method is based on MAHALANOBIS Distance feature ranking and an improved exhaustive search to choose a better combination of features. We evaluate the approach on the KDD CUP 1999 datasets using SVM classifier and KNN classifier. The results show that classification is done with high classification rate and low misclassification rate with the reduced feature subsets.","","978-1-4673-6452-2","","10.1109/SNS-PCS.2013.6553837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553837","Feature Selection;KNN;MAHALANOBIS Distance;SVM;classification;intrusion detection","Feature extraction;Industries;Kernel;Optimized production technology;Support vector machines;Virtual private networks","computer networks;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication security","K-nearest neighbor;KDD CUP 1999 datasets;KNN classifier;MAHALANOBIS distance feature ranking;NIDS;SVM classifier;detection accuracy;exhaustive search;feature selection algorithm;network audit data;network intrusion detection system;network security;support vector machines","","0","","14","","","18-19 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an anomaly detection system for web-based applications. The anomaly detection system monitors the attribute value pairs of successful HTTP requests received by webserver applications and automatically creates parameter profiles. It then uses these profiles to detect anomalies in the HTTP requests. Customized profiles help reduce the number of false positives.

Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.","","","","10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975641","Anomaly Detection;Software Security;Trace Analysis","Engines;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Servers;Testing;Training","digital forensics;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","TotalADS;automated anomaly detection framework;automated software anomaly detection system;daily emergence;execution traces;extensible Eclipse-based open source framework;forensic insights;host-based anomaly detection;modern Linux server;normal trace stream;software system;software threats;system administrators resort;system scanners","","0","","27","","","28-29 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since it seems impossible to guarantee complete protection to a system by means of the ""classical"" prevention mechanisms, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems has emerged as a key element in network security. In this paper we address the problem considering some techniques for detecting network anomalies. Our approach is based on the use of different compression algorithms for detecting anomalies in the network traffic running over TCP. In more detail we take into account the use of three different compression algorithms, based on distinct approaches, namely: Huffman coding, Dynamic Markov Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. The proposed methods are based on the consideration that the entropy represents a lower bound to the compression rate that we can obtain, and that the more redundant the data are and the better we can compress them. The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199270","","Communications Society;Compression algorithms;Cryptography;Data security;Entropy;Huffman coding;Image coding;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection","Internet;Markov processes;encoding;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Huffman coding;Internet;Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm;TCP;compression algorithms;dynamic Markov coding;intrusion detection systems;network anomaly detection;network security;network traffic;security attacks","","0","","19","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud networking extends cloud computing by providing virtualized networking functionalities and allows various optimizations, for example to reduce latency while increasing flexibility in the placement, movement, and interconnection of these virtual resources. However, this approach introduces new security challenges. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection model in which we combine a newly proposed genetic based feature selection algorithm and an existing Fuzzy Support Vector Machines (SVM) for effective classification as a solution. The feature selection reduces the number of features by removing unimportant features, hence reducing runtime. Moreover, when the Fuzzy SVM classifier is used with the reduced feature set, it improves the detection accuracy.

This paper proposes the application of a genetic algorithm to estimate the location of such malicious nodes. Simulation results show that with nine anchor nodes in a 1 km by 1 km area, the algorithm is capable of estimating the intruderpsilas position within a radius of 45 meters in 60% of the cases.

The lack of mechanisms for management frame authentication and the complexity of the protocol itself have derived into a considerable number of denial of service and identity spoofing attacks. As most denial of service attacks are based on spoofing of MAC addresses, spoofed frame detection schemes have gained attentions. Currently the most efficient techniques to detect this kind of attacks are based on the creation of profiles for the wireless nodes and behavior based protocol anomaly detection. However, these techniques tend to generate too many of false positives. This is caused by the unstable nature of the wireless medium and also because of the difficulty to model the behaviour of the diverse implementations from different manufacturers. One way to reduce false positives is to combine different techniques to carry out the analysis. We propose a novel method that identifies the impersonation of certain management frames, which helps to reduce the number of false positives within other existing MAC spoofing detection techniques.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529384","802.11 MAC address spoofing;false positive","Authentication;Availability;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer science education;Computer security;Identity management systems;Intrusion detection;Personal digital assistants;Protocols","access protocols;computational complexity;message authentication;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 network;beacon MAC frame spoofing attack detection;management frame authentication;protocol","","1","","26","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network traffic sample is considered an anomaly if its abstract feature falls on the outside of the fitting envelope. We justify the effectiveness of the presented approach against 150000+ traffic samples from the NSL-KDD dataset in training and testing, demonstrating positive promise in detecting network attacks by identifying samples that have abnormal features.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280573","incremental learning;intrusion detection system;neural networks;outlier detection","Adaptation models;Character recognition;Classification algorithms;Testing","computer network security;data structures;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","NSL-KDD dataset;abnormal features;anomaly behavior;data abstraction;dynamic changing environment;fitting envelopes;incremental majority learning;intrusion detection systems;iterative evolutions;large network traffic data;network attacks;network-traffic anomaly detection;unsupervised learning","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although research on the detection of attacks has been performed for several decades, today's systems are not able to cope with modern attack vectors. One of the reasons is the increasing use of encrypted communication that strongly limits the detection of malicious activities. While encryption provides a number of significant advantages for the end user like, for example, an increased level of privacy, many classical approaches of intrusion detection fail. Since it is typically not possible to decrypt the traffic, performing analysis w.r.t. the presence of certain patterns is almost impossible.

Despite many of these machine learning approaches have achieved the goal of getting high accuracy levels in a more automatic way, the fact is that only a few of them have actually been deployed on real life scenarios. This could be explained if we take into consideration that some of the assumptions in which these techniques rely on, do not easily hold. Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels.

One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper we propose an intrusion detection method that proposes rough set based feature selection heuristics and using fuzzy ants for clustering data. Rough set has to decrease the amount of data and get rid of redundancy. Fuzzy ants clustering methods allow objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership.

One difficult class of attack to defend against is user-initiated malicious software (malware) execution. User-initiated malware penetrates the security perimeter with assistance provided, either intentionally or unintentionally, by and enterprise's end users. These users assist the attacker by downloading malware from a Web site, invoking malware arriving as e-mail attachments and introducing malware inside the perimeter via the unauthorized use of foreign media, e.g., floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or unauthorized media devices, e.g., USB drives, or unauthorized wireless networking hardware. In this paper, we describe characteristics of the most widely used defense techniques for the blocking of user-initiated malware and why these techniques are insufficient. We then introduce a module verification strategy that eliminates, or at least severely reduce, this problem by extending the classic ""defense in depth"" network security strategy. We then describe how the augmentation of a standard operating system loader to include references to a database of cryptographic hashes of module executables can be used to implement this strategy.

But intrusions and misuses have always threatened the secured data communication over networks. Consequently, network security has come into issue. Now-a-days intrusion detection systems play an important role in security infrastructures. Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. The host based systems as well as the network based systems have their own limitations. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present NIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces some significant problems contained by the previous systems such as trust issues and message spreading problems. In the proposed IDS we donpsilat need to install the system for every host. That reduces the system overhead to a reasonable extent. This system generates steady responses against intrusions and stops the intruder to proceed for further attacks.","","978-0-7695-3653-8","","10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5169326","Discard Packet;Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion Prevention;Packet Behavior;Trust Issue","Centralized control;Communication system security;Computer science;Control systems;Data communication;Data security;Global communication;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Springs","computer networks;data communication;security of data;telecommunication security","IDS;NIDS;computer network;global communication;host based system;intrusion prevention;malicious attack;message spreading problem;network based intrusion detection system;network based system;network security;secured data communication;security infrastructure;system overhead;trust issue","","0","","10","","","17-20 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main contribution of this paper is a novel methodology to design and implement secure mobile devices by offering a resource-optimized method that combines efficient, light-weight malware detection on the mobile device with high precision detection methods on cloud servers. We focus on the early detection of behavioral patterns of malware families rather than the detection of malware binary signatures. Upon detection of an attack, an alarm is raised and the damage that can be caused by the detected malware type is estimated. Furthermore, the database with behavioral patterns is continuously updated, thus keeping a device resistant to new malware families.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2014.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980300","behavioral patterns;distributed detection;information security;machine learning;mobile malware","Databases;Detection algorithms;Feature extraction;Malware;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets","cloud computing;invasive software;mobile computing","attack detection;cloud servers;efficient-light-weight malware detection;high-precision detection methods;malware family behavioral pattern detection;mobile devices;mobile malware detection;resource-optimized approach;resource-optimized method;secure mobile device design;secure mobile device implementation","","0","","49","","","8-12 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new approach to automated response called the Response and Recovery Engine (RRE). Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.","","978-1-4244-4422-9","978-1-4244-4421-2","10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307","","Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics)","Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game","","21","2","28","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper; we evaluate the performance of various rule based classifiers like: JRip, RIDOR, NNge and decision table using ensemble approach in order to build an efficient network intrusion detection system. We use KDDCup'99, intrusion detection benchmark dataset (which is a part of DARPA evaluation program) for our experimentation.

In this paper, to solve this problem, we introduce a new approach for anomaly detection using contiguous expert voting algorithm (CEVS). At first, we present our framework of the anomaly detection system, and then we define a new algorithm based on data mining, at last we will use this algorithm to detect the internet anomaly and report our experimental result.

Traditionally, the approach taken to find attacks is to inspect the contents of every packet. However, packet inspection cannot easily be performed at high-speeds. Therefore, researchers and operators started investigating alternative approaches, such as flow-based intrusion detection. In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed. The concept of flows is explained, and relevant standards are identified.

This paper describes a collection of 0/1 Integer Programming Problems that are associated with the selection of appropriate Rule Portfolios for Real Time Intrusion Detection Systems. The problems are shown to have Knapsack and Set Packing constraints. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the parameters in the cost models, a robust version of the problem is also studied, where parametric uncertainties are allowed to be present.
