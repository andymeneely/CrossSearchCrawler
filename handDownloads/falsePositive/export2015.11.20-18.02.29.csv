Due to these advancements more and more services are available for malicious exploitation. New vulnerabilities are found from common programs and even on vulnerability in a single computer might compromise the network of an entire company. There are two parallel ways to address this threat. The first way is to ensure that a computer doesn't have any known security vulnerabilities, before allowing it to the network it has access rights. The other way, is to use an Intrusion Detection System. IDSs concentrate on detecting malicious network traffic, such as packets that would exploit known security vulnerability. Generally the intrusions are detected by analyzing 41 attributes from the intrusion detection dataset. In this work we tried to reduce the number of attributes by using various ranking based feature selection techniques and evaluation has been done using ten classification algorithms that I have evaluated most important. So that the intrusions can be detected accurately in short period of time. Then the combinations of the six reduced feature sets have been made using Boolean AND operator. Then their performance has been analyzed using 10 classification algorithms. Finally the top ten combinations of feature selection have been evaluated among 1585 unique combinations. Combination of Symmetric and Gain Ratio while considering top 15 attributes has highest performance.","","978-1-4799-7682-9","","10.1109/PDGC.2014.7030720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030720","Boolean AND operator;Data Mining;Feature Selection Techniques;Garret's Ranking Technique;Intrusion Detection System;NSL-KDD Dataset;WEKA","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Training;Vegetation","Boolean functions;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","Boolean AND operator;IDS;classification algorithms;combinational feature selection approach;malicious network traffic detection;network intrusion detection system;ranking based feature selection techniques","","0","","26","","","11-13 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper adds survey on BPSK and M-ary QAM OEWC, which can properly support anti-MAI (Multiple-Access Interference) capability on DS-CDMA system. Variable-length characteristic of the OEWC family allows arbitrary code chip, hence, chip length can be chosen to suit the number of users for improving system efficiency and utilization.

This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","5","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and Naïve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of Naïve Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we develop novel algorithms by which mobile robots can coordinate their motions in order to minimize the time required to verify the advertised location for given accuracy bounds. Our specific contributions on this paper are threefold. Firstly, we develop a framework that uses a combination of the particle filters (for position estimation) and the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (for threshold of validation) to drive the motion models for rapid verification of the reported position. We believe our approach is the first in the literature that is accurate, easy to compute, and feasible for practical implementation. Secondly, we propose a centralized coordinated motion algorithm that is optimal at each sampling time. This provides a lower bound on detection time that can be used as a benchmark for practical considerations. Thirdly, we present a practical heuristic approach that allows for distributed protocol based on the concept of the gradient vectors. Subsequently, we also advocate a sub-optimal approach, derived from our heuristic approach, which provides a good trade-off between performance and computational resources. Our results are important for the development of secure access control schemes to prevent unauthorized access of communication networks from malicious users.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2015.2398834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066967","Particle filters;intrusion detections;networked multi-robot systems;target tracking","Base stations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Robot kinematics;Trajectory;Wireless communication","RSSI;mobile robots;optimisation;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio transceivers;radionavigation","Cramer-Rao lower bounds;centralized coordinated motion algorithm;distributed protocol;gradient vectors;heuristic approach;mobile robots;optimized trajectory;particle filters;position estimation;rapid wireless tracking verification;received signal strength measurements;suboptimal approach","","0","","","","2015-03-24","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","","978-1-4799-7324-8","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","0","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One positive example to thousands of negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning treats the extremely small instances as noise. The standard approach for this difficulty is balancing training data by resampling them. However, this results in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing majority instances by partitioning them into clusters. This greatly reduces the ambiguity between minority instances and instances in each cluster. For moderately high imbalance ratio and low in-class complexity, our technique gives better prediction accuracy than undersampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio like splice site prediction problem, we demonstrate that this technique serves as a good filter with almost perfect recall that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed and yield significant improvements over previous predictor. We also show that the technique works for sub cellular localization and post-translational modification site prediction problems.","","0-7695-2457-5","","10.1109/ICHIS.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587765","","Application software;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Genomics;Machine learning;Proteins;Supervised learning;Testing;Training data;Unsupervised learning","biology computing;genetics;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","data imbalance;functional genomics;machine learning;post-translational modification site prediction;subcellular localization;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","","2","","21","","","6-9 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We assume that the effect of each active intrusion on a particular significant measure is superimposed on the normal operation of that measure; thus, we are able to obtain a complete representation of the overall bipartite graph model by superimposing the simpler graphs associated with each individual intrusion. The key ingredient of our MIDS is the development of a modified belief propagation max-product algorithm (MPA) that avoids the exponential complexity of the original MPA by limiting, during the iteration process, the number of active intrusions that are connected to a particular measure. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed MIDS performs well in detecting both single and multiple intrusions with a very low false alarm rate.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2008.928536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4598827","Bayesian network;belief propagation algorithm;intrusion detection;multiple intrusion model;naive Bayesian network model","Application software;Bayesian methods;Belief propagation;Bipartite graph;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Particle measurements","graph theory;security of data","belief propagation;graphical inference;max-product algorithm;multiple intrusion detection system;weighted bipartite graph","","2","","37","","","Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, these logs and alerts are not only huge in number but also poor in data quality i.e. containing false logs/alerts. This in turn poses two main challenges to higher-level operations; first computationally efficient algorithms are needed to process and shift through large unverified logs and alerts. Second is the need to develop algorithms that avoid making wrong conclusions due to poor quality logs and alerts. In this paper, we implement intrusion alert quality framework to reduce false positive alerts in IDS. Using this framework, we enrich each alert with quality parameters such as correctness, accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity. To compliment this effort, we normalize the enriched alerts in the IDMEF format. In this form (enriched and normalized), higher level operations are given the option to utilize the quality parameters values tagged in the alerts in their core operations in order to produce good conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in reducing false positive alerts using DARPA 2000 network traffic.","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635545","Alert Correlation;Data Quality;Intrusion Detection;Security","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Information filtering;Information filters;Information security;Intrusion detection;Organizing;Telecommunication traffic","security of data;telecommunication security","DARPA 2000 network traffic;false positives reduction;filtering routers;firewalls;intrusion alert quality framework;security monitoring sensors","","2","","22","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The implementation of these critical systems will require appropriate cyber-security measures. A network anomaly detection solution is considered in this paper. In common network architectures multiple communications streams are simultaneously present, making it difficult to build an anomaly detection solution for the entire system. In addition, common anomaly detection algorithms require specification of a sensitivity threshold, which inevitably leads to a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives rates. In order to alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a novel anomaly detection architecture. The designed system applies a previously developed network security cyber-sensor method to individual selected communication streams allowing for learning accurate normal network behavior models. In addition, an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2 FLS) is used to model human background knowledge about the network system and to dynamically adjust the sensitivity threshold of the anomaly detection algorithms. The IT2 FLS was used to model the linguistic uncertainty in describing the relationship between various network communication attributes and the possibility of a cyber attack. The proposed method was tested on an experimental smart grid system demonstrating enhanced cyber-security.","","978-1-4673-0161-9","978-1-4673-0162-6","10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6309292","Anomaly Detection;Critical Systems;Cyber Sensor;Domain Knowledge;Fuzzy Logic System;Smart Grid","Detection algorithms;Feature extraction;Frequency selective surfaces;Fuzzy logic;Pragmatics;Sensitivity;Telecommunication traffic","fuzzy logic;security of data;smart power grids","IT2 FLS;anomaly detection algorithms;anomaly detection solution;cyber-security measures;false negatives rates;false positive rates;interval type-2 fuzzy logic system;linguistic domain knowledge;normal network behavior models;novel anomaly detection architecture;planned large scale deployment;smart grid network devices;smart grid systems","","2","","25","","","14-16 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops an approach, interactive visualization of wormholes (IVoW), to monitor and detect such attacks in large scale wireless networks in real time. We characterize the topology features of a network under wormhole attacks through the node position changes and visualize the information at dynamically adjusted scales. We integrate an automatic detection algorithm with appropriate user interactions to handle complicated scenarios that include a large number of moving nodes and multiple worm-hole attackers. Various visual forms have been adopted to assist the understanding and analysis of the reconstructed network topology and improve the detection accuracy. Extended simulation has demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectively locate the fake neighbor connections without introducing many false alarms. IVoW does not require the wireless nodes to be equipped with any special hardware, thus avoiding any additional cost.

Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming. The proposed approach classifies and simplifies the long observation sequence by virtue of rough set reduction, and the decision conditions obtained in rough set reduction phase could be used in further detection. The experimental results indicate that this method can promote the model training efficiency.

Anomaly intrusion detection models detect new attacks by observing the deviation from profile. However there are many problems in the traditional IDS such as high false alarm rate, low detection capability against new network attacks and insufficient analysis capacity. The use of machine learning for intrusion models automatically increases the performance with an improved experience. This paper proposes a novel method of integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) by optimizing the kernel parameters using automatic parameter selection technique. This technique reduces the training and testing time to identify intrusions thereby improving the accuracy. The proposed method was tested on KDD data set. The datasets were carefully divided into training and testing considering the minority attacks such as U2R and R2L to be present in the testing set to identify the occurrence of unknown attack. The results indicate that the proposed method is successful in identifying intrusions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method outperforms other classification techniques using SVM as the classifier and other dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques. Minimum resources are consumed as the classifier input requires reduced feature set and thereby minimizing training and testing overhead time.","","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019692","Cross Validation;Dimensionality Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;Principal Component Analysis;Radial Basis Function Kernel;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feature selection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;KDD data set;PCA;R2L;U2R;anomaly intrusion detection model;automatic parameter selection technique;classification accuracy;classification technique;dimensionality reduction;false alarm rate;feature selection technique;insufficient analysis capacity;intrusion detection system;intrusion model;kernel parameter;low detection capability;machine learning;network attack;optimized SVM;principal component analysis;support vector machine","","0","","39","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks. DARPA 2000 intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and a testbed network were used to evaluate the innovative alert correlation model. Comparisons with a previous correlation system were performed. The results of processing these datasets and recognizing the attack patterns demonstrated the potential of the improved correlation model and gave favorable results.","","978-0-9893-1933-1","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918249","Alert Correlation;Alert Reduction;False Alarm Rate;Intrusion Detection Systems","Collaboration;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern recognition","security of data","CIDS;attack patterns;collaborative intrusion alert correlation;collaborative intrusion detection systems;correlation components;correlation process performance;correlation processing time;innovative alert correlation model;innovative framework;intruders intention;modified algorithm;security related activity","","0","","34","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo. Moreover, ns-2 simulation results show that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged, while energy savings of 20 to 100 times are achieved, depending on the scenario.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654513","Sensor networks;local monitoring;malicious nodes.;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna","Antennas;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Sleep;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","ELMO;WSN;energy aware local monitoring;energy constrained system;energy consumption;local monitoring based security algorithm;sleep wake management;wireless sensor network","","3","","40","","2010-12-03","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.","","978-1-4799-8098-7","","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064618","Excerpt Query;Hash-based traceback;Packet Attribution System;Payload Attribution System","Hafnium;IP networks","Internet;computer network security;data structures;digital forensics;optimisation;quality of service;query processing;telecommunication network routing","AS;Internet security;NMS;QoS;autonomous system;bloom filters;excerpt query process optimization;network forensic technique;packet attribution system;packet data store;routing task;source traceback","","0","","18","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

(2) LDPM uses a new IP header encoding scheme to store the complete identification information of a router into a single packet, thus it can protect the privacy of network topology and victims can identify attack ingress router with one packet. It also can cope with large distributed attacks with thousands of attackers. (3) LDPM can manipulate the marking information at the edge ingress routers. Therefore, as a value-added services, ISPs can provide traceback business to their customers. Compared with previous traceback schemes, LDPM improves the performance and practicability of IP traceback.","","978-0-7695-3825-9","","10.1109/EmbeddedCom-ScalCom.2009.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341555","IP traceback;deterministic packet marking;distributed denial of service;network security;packet logging","Computer crime;Computer networks;Embedded computing;Encoding;IP networks;Information security;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Privacy;Protection","IP networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP header encoding scheme;IP spoofing attack;IP traceback mechanism;attack ingress router;deterministic packet logging;deterministic packet marking;distributed hierarchical IP traceback system;network topology privacy protection;single packet router","","3","","24","","","25-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules. A worst-case analysis shows that the saving in hardware resources is achieved with a relatively small buffer space, currently available in cheap, low end, FPGA boards, with no impairment on the resulting throughput.","1946-1488","978-1-4244-7842-2","","10.1109/FPL.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694212","","","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based solution;NIDS;elastic buffers;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;reconfigurable rule matching core;reprogrammability;worst-case analysis","","5","","13","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To minimize these drawbacks, we propose an event-driven intrusion detection architecture which integrates subject-verb-object (SVO) multi-point monitors and an impact analysis engine.

The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model.

In this article, we first introduce native API briefly and then divide the captured sequences with slide window method to establish normal pattern database. Then support vector machine method is used for anomaly detection due to its advantages in small-scale dataset and generalization capability.

Our classification use a combination of keyword matching technique and statistical behavior profiles. Keywords are pre-defined by observing from both audio and video traffic. Behavior profiles consist of three attributes, which are the average received packet size, a ratio of number of server-client packets, and the flow duration. Each attribute have an independent threshold of mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma). The experimental results show that our method can classify an audio traffic, a video traffic and normal Web traffic with a high precision and recall.","","978-1-4244-4521-9","978-1-4244-4522-6","10.1109/ISCIT.2009.5341026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341026","","Bandwidth;Communication system traffic control;Communications technology;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Shape control;Streaming media;TV;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;audio streaming;transport protocols;video streaming","HTTP protocol;Internet;Web traffic;audio streaming;audio traffic classification;hyper text transfer protocol;keyword matching technique;online services;standard deviation;statistical behavior;video streaming;video traffic classification","","2","","11","","","28-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different intrusion detection techniques can be employed to search for attack patterns in the observed data. Misuse detection and anomaly detection are the most commonly used techniques. But they have their own disadvantages. To overcome those issues, hybrid methods are used. Hybrid classifiers are able to provide improved accuracy, but have a complex structure and high computational cost. Hence a new hybrid learning method, that integrates k-means clustering and naïve bayes classification, has been introduced. A relation between the distances from each data sample to a number of centroids found by a clustering algorithm is introduced. This is used to form new features, based on the features of the original data set. These distance sum-based features are then used for classifier training and detection.","","978-1-4673-6822-3","","10.1109/ICSCN.2015.7219835","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219835","Euclidean distance function;Intrusion detection;k-means clustering;naïve bayes classifier","Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Signal processing algorithms;Support vector machines;Training","Bayes methods;firewalls;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering","IDSs;anomaly detection;distance sum-based features;firewalls;hybrid learning method;intrusion detection systems;k-means clustering;misuse detection;naïve Bayes classifier;static security mechanisms","","0","","18","","","26-28 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a survey of the main types of attack at the network layer, and we then review intrusion detection and protection mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature. We classify these mechanisms as either point detection algorithms that deal with a single type of attack, or as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that can deal with a range of attacks.

IEEE","20021107","2002","3","","1530","1539","We propose a simple and robust mechanism for detecting SYN flooding attacks. Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","86","7","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system.
