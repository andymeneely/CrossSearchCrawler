Most correlation algorithms use only one characteristic and require all values in the correlation matrix (the correlation value of all flows to all other flows) to be updated on every event. We have developed an algorithm that tracks multiple (n) characteristics per flow, and requires updating only the flow's n values upon an event, not all the values for all the flows. The n correlation values are used as coordinates for a point in n-space; two flows are considered correlated if there is a very small Euclidean distance between them.

The security of wireless sensor networks is a big concern. Hence for secure communication it is important to detect and prevent the attacks in network. Major focus is given on security and on detection and prevention of attacks. Adversary can create gray-hole attack and black-hole attack simultaneously; there are many methods which do not provide proper method to defend against these kinds of attacks. The Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) scheme is used for detecting Gray-Hole attack and Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgment (EAACK) mechanism is used for detecting black-hole attack in network. But only by detecting and preventing the attacks, it does not provide the better security to wireless network. Therefore, to secure network a hybrid mechanism is deployed in wireless sensor network. Security algorithm for wireless sensor networks such as CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is used for secure communication. The CAWS and Modern Encryption Standard (MES-1) is an advanced cryptography method which is used for encryption and decryption process to provide special security. This paper focuses on strong security by detecting and preventing attacks, also ensures data authentication, integrity of data and solves less power transmission of data and receiver collision problem, by deploying hybrid mechanism.","","","","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164714","AODV;CAWS;EAACK;MES-1;secure routing protocol;wireless sensor network","Communication system security;Encryption;Intrusion detection;Standards;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","AODV scheme;CAWS;EAACK mechanism;MES-1;ad hoc on demand distance vector scheme;attack prevention;black-hole attack detection;cryptography method;data authentication;data integrity;enhanced adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;gray-hole attack detection;intrusion detection system;modern encryption standard;receiver collision problem;wireless sensor network security","","0","","17","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel real-time QRS detection technique using two-phase hashing is proposed in this paper. Our technique relies more on the data stream corresponding to ECG beats than any particular feature. We use the concept of shared counters to minimize the memory requirement while efficiently shifting through suspicious strings.

As a program runs, it uses the services of the underlying operating system to do some system calls. This system does not exactly need to know the program codes of each process. Normal and intrusive behaviors are collected with gathering the sequences of system calls for each process. Analysis of data is done via data mining and fuzzy techniques. Data mining is used to extract the normal behavior.

In this work we propose a cross-layer based routing attack detection system for ad hoc networks. Previous work that uses mostly audit trails collected from the routing protocol suffers from inadequacy of features to construct a reliable model for detecting anomalous routing behavior. On the other hand, use of linear detectors lead to very high false positives and false negatives because of the inherent non-linear nature of the feature space. In this work, we address these issues by collating features from multiple protocols at different layers and using a non-linear detector based on support vector machine (SVM). The consequent problem of computational expense of the detection process is addressed by a combination of novel data reduction techniques. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CRADS is far superior than conventional protocol-specific detection systems.","1525-3511","978-1-4244-1997-5","","10.1109/WCNC.2008.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489304","","Ad hoc networks;Communications Society;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cross layer design;Data security;Detectors;Multimedia systems;Routing protocols;Support vector machines","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;support vector machines;telecommunication security","CRADS;MANET;ad hoc networks;anomalous routing behavior detection;cross layer routing attack detection systems;cross-layer based routing attack detection system;data reduction;integrated cross layer;linear detectors;multiple protocols;nonlinear detector;nonlinear nature;routing protocol;support vector machine","","5","","14","","","March 31 2008-April 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an improved “requires/provides” model is presented which established a cooperation between statistical and knowledge-based model, to achieve higher detection rate with the minimal false positives. A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs. The proposed model has been implemented in real-time and has successfully generated security events on establishing a correlation between attack signatures.

This paper explores the negative impacts of packet dropping attacks and a method to detect such attacks. First, three dropping patterns are classified and investigated. We demonstrate that attackers can choose different dropping patterns to degrade TCP service to different levels, and selectively dropping a very, small number of packets can result in severe damage to TCP performance. Second, we show that a hacker can utilize a DDoS attack tool to control a “uncompromised” router to emulate dropping attacks. This proves that dropping attacks are indeed practically very possible to happen in today's Internet environment. Third, we present a statistical analysis module for the detection of TCP packet dropping attacks. Three measures, session delay, the position and the number of packet reorderings, have been implemented in the statistical module. This paper has evaluated and compared their detection performance","","0-7695-0921-5","","10.1109/ICNP.2000.896310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=896310","","Computer crime;Computer hacking;Counting circuits;Degradation;Delay;Internet;Position measurement;Quality of service;Statistical analysis;Statistics","Internet;packet switching;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;transport protocols","Internet environment;TCP performance;denial of service attacks;detection performance;dropping attack;hacker;malicious packet dropping;packet reorderings;position;router;session delay;severe damage;statistical analysis module","","6","","14","","","2000","14 Nov 2000-17 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But as the network advanced, intrusions and misuses followed. Consequently, network security has come into issue. Now-a-days intrusion detection systems have become a standard component in security infrastructures. Intrusions typically start with intruders infiltrating a network through a vulnerable host and after that approaching for further malicious attacks. The techniques used for intrusion detection have their particular limitations. Any of the intrusion detection systems proposed so far is not completely flawless. And practically all of them require some kind of termination in network connections. So, the quest for betterment continues. In this progression, here we present PIDS: a complete intrusion detection system which reduces most of the problems contained by the previous systems and it doesnpsilat need to terminate any network connections to detect the intruder. This system generates quick responses against intrusions and stops the intruder to proceed for further attacks.","","978-0-7695-3595-1","","10.1109/ICIME.2009.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5077011","Intrusion Detection System;Intrusion Prevention;Network Connection Termination;Packet Behavior;Trust Issue","Centralized control;Computer science;Control systems;Humans;Information management;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Real time systems","computer networks;security of data","PIDS;computer networks;global connectivity;malicious attacks;network intrusion detection;network intrusion prevention;network security","","1","","10","","","3-5 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies and notifies other nodes in the network to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. Numerous schemes have been proposed for intrusion detection and response systems, for ad hoc networks. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. In this paper, we examine the vulnerabilities of wireless networks and argue that we must include intrusion detection in the security architecture for mobile computing environment. We propose a mIDS (mobile intrusion detection system) suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, which detects nodes misbehavior, anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. mIDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes. Simple rules are designed to identify the misbehavior nodes. Theproess of identyfing the misbehavior node is carried out by a special node called a monitor node. Periodically monitor node is identified in the network.","","978-0-7695-3126-7","","10.1109/ISA.2008.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511525",": IDS;CDMA;DoS;QoS;TDMA;mIDS","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Availability;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Protection;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;authorisation;cryptography;mobile computing;packet radio networks;telecommunication security","authentication;encryption software;firewalls;mobile computing environment;mobile intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;packet transmissions;response systems;security services;wireless networks","","3","","21","","","24-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To provide an indication of different volumetric motion sensing technologies' strengths and weaknesses in these areas, investigation has been made into the performances of dual and quad element passive infrared, and dual technology passive infrared/microwave sensors. This was accomplished by practical testing, with theoretical analyses of the outcomes before comparison of specific detectors to allow interpretations about each technology type. Some interpretations do not agree with outcomes predicted from theory or common views within the electronic security industry.

As the popularity of VoIP systems increases, they are being subjected to different kinds of intrusions some of which are specific to such systems and some of which follow a general pattern. VoIP systems pose several new challenges to intrusion detection system (IDS) designers. First, these systems employ multiple protocols for call management (e.g., SIP) and data delivery (e.g., RTP). Second, the systems are distributed in nature and employ distributed clients, servers and proxies. Third, the attacks to such systems span a large class, from denial of service to billing fraud attacks. Finally, the systems are heterogeneous and typically under several different administrative domains. In this paper, we propose the design of an intrusion detection system targeted to VoIP systems, called SCIDIVE (pronounced ""Skydive""). SCIDIVE is structured to detect different classes of intrusions, including, masquerading, denial of service, and media stream-based attacks. It can operate with both classes of protocols that compose VoIP systems - call management protocols (CMP), e.g., SIP, and media delivery protocols (MDP), e.g., RTP. SCIDIVE proposes two abstractions for VoIP IDS - stateful detection and cross-protocol detection. Stateful detection denotes assembling state from multiple packets and using the aggregated state in the rule-matching engine. Cross protocol detection denotes matching rules that span multiple protocols. SCIDIVE is demonstrated on a sample VoIP system that comprises SIP clients and SIP proxy servers with RTP as the data delivery protocol. Four attack scenarios are created and the accuracy and the efficiency of the system evaluated with rules meant to catch these attacks.","","0-7695-2052-9","","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311913","","Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer networks;IP networks;Internet telephony;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Streaming media;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet telephony;client-server systems;data communication;protocols;security of data","IP networks;SCIDIVE;SIP proxy servers;VoIP systems;billing fraud attacks;call management protocols;cross-protocol detection;data delivery;denial-of-service intrusion;intrusion detection;masquerading intrusion;media delivery protocols;media stream-based attacks;rule-matching engine;stateful detection;voice traffic transmition;voice-over-IP","","29","4","17","","","28 June-1 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a novel fast multi-pattern matching algorithm, the Hash Boyer-Moore (HBM) Algorithm, is presented, which reduces the memory footprint of the heuristic table using a hash function and adds another heuristic table to reduce the false-positive ratio. Analyses and simulations show HBM offers higher speed and lower memory cost than some existing algorithms. The HBM algorithm was implemented on the Intel IXP 2400 Network Processor (NP) platform and experiments show suitable performance results in a Gigabit Ethernet LAN environment.","0190-3918","978-0-7695-2933-2","","10.1109/ICPP.2007.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4343823","","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computer networks;Computer security;Costs;Filters;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","authorisation;computer networks;cryptography;digital signatures;pattern matching;telecommunication security","deep packet inspection;firewall;hash Boyer-Moore algorithm;heuristic table;intrusion detection system;multipattern matching algorithm;network processor;network security;signature based scanner","","3","","24","","","10-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three particular scenarios are highlighted, which showcase this need. When using supervised Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), these systems need labelled datasets to be trained. Also, the real nature of the analysed datasets must be known when evaluating the efficiency of the IDSs when detecting intrusions. Another scenario is the use of feature selection that works only if the processed datasets are labelled. In normal conditions, collecting labelled datasets from real networks is impossible. Currently, datasets are mainly labelled by implementing off-line forensic analysis, which is impractical because it does not allow real-time implementation. We have developed a novel approach to automatically generate labelled network traffic datasets using an unsupervised anomaly based IDS. The resulting labelled datasets are subsets of the original unlabelled datasets. The labelled dataset is then processed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach, which performs the task of feature selection. The GA has been implemented to automatically provide the set of metrics that generate the most appropriate intrusion detection results.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956736","Automatic Labelling;Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm;Network Traffic Labelling;Unsupervised Anomaly IDS","Biological cells;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Measurement;Telecommunication traffic","digital forensics;feature selection;genetic algorithms","GA based approach;automatic dataset labelling;feature selection;genetic algorithm;labelled network traffic dataset;offline forensic analysis;real-time implementation;supervised intrusion detection systems;unlabelled dataset;unsupervised anomaly based IDS","","1","","13","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To balance the resource consumption and prolong the lifetime of all nodes, each cluster should elect a node with the most remaining resources as its leader. However, without incentives for serving others, a node may behave selfishly by lying about its remaining resource and avoiding being elected. We present a solution based on mechanism design theory. More specifically, we design a scheme for electing cluster leaders that have the following two advantages: First, the collection of elected leaders is the optimal in the sense that the overall resource consumption will be balanced among all nodes in the network overtime. Second, the scheme provides the leaders with incentives in the form of reputation so that nodes are encouraged to honestly participate in the election process. The design of such incentives is based on the Vickrey, Clarke, and Groves (VCG) model by which truth-telling is the dominant strategy for each node.

Recent advances in biological immune systems showed that the innate part of the system plays a greater role than previously thought. In this paper, this recent development is the corner stone of the new multi-layer model of artificial immune systems. We describe a work in progress to construct a multi-layered defense system composed of two main layers, innate and adaptive layers. This paper describes the multi-layered system layers and components, gives a detailed justification and design considerations of the system components, and shows first results from the innate layer of the system.

In this paper, we propose a simple solution called ""Buttercup"" to counter against attacks based on buffer-overflow exploits (such as CodeRed, Nimda, Slammer, and Blaster). We have implemented our idea in SNORT, and included 19 return address ranges of buffer-overflow exploits.

Based on the behavioral profiles, a two-level matching is used in identifying new traffic. We first determine if a host participates in the application by comparing its behavior with the profiles. Subsequently, for each flow of the host we compare if it matches with the patterns in the profiles to determine which flows belong to this application.

In order to improve the detecting efficiency of detectors and the dependence of matching threshold on an experienced value in the negative selection algorithm, an algorithm named VRGA for detector generation is proposed in this paper. Variable matching threshold r (r-variable) is introduced in VRGA to effectively increase the detector coverage. Clonal selection strategy considering detector similarity is adopted to increase the diversity of detectors. With above two improvements, VRGA brings the self-adaptability of matching threshold in negative selection and reduces the dependence of matching threshold on experience. In addition, VRGA increases the coverage and diversity of the detector set. The experimental results show that VGRA has better performance and its detecting efficiency is also improved correspondingly over the traditional negative selection algorithm.","","978-0-7695-3304-9","","10.1109/ICNC.2008.617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4667907","artificial immune;concentration of detector;matching threshold;negative selection","Biology computing;Computer science;Detectors;Educational institutions;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Phase detection;Protection;Random number generation","pattern matching;security of data","VRGA;clonal selection;detector generation;detector similarity;immune-based intrusion detection system;negative selection algorithm;self-adaptability;variable matching threshold","","1","","17","","","18-20 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It defines normal and abnormal classes using the normalized “standard scores” of the traffic data with a novel unit-circle representation. In this approach, the feature values of the traffic data are first standardized to reduce statistical dependencies of local structural variations within a class and then normalized to isolate statistical inaccuracies between classes. A unit-circle is then constructed using two selected features. The unit-circle algorithm reveals that the normal and the back attack traffic in NSL-KDD datasets fall inside the normal and the abnormal classes respectively.

Its dynamics and flexibility allow the network to be easily set up without the requirement of a predetermined infrastructure. The advancement of the technology itself draws attentions from intruders as well as researchers and developers. Consequently, detecting intrusions on wireless ad hoc network is one of the most challenging issues facing today's researchers. Its dynamic nature permits the existence of a great number of difficulties in implementing its security features. In a highly dynamic ad hoc network, it is inefficient to learn normal behaviours of each node from the network where nodes move in and out all the time. This research introduces an approach for sinkhole countermeasure. Sinkhole attacks occur when malicious nodes do not relay the received data to a destination and finally cause an availability problem to the network in the form of denial-of-services. Here, malicious nodes try to disable any services passing through it. We present a mechanism for adaptively detecting and defending against sinkhole attacks in a dynamic ad hoc system by applying trust-based algorithm on ad hoc nodes. Weights and thresholds are used for separating suspicious behaviours from normal ones","","0-7803-9545-X","","10.1109/AERO.2006.1655944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1655944","","Ad hoc networks;Adaptive systems;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Paper technology","ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","adaptive sinkhole detection;denial-of-services;intrusion detection;security features;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","21","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm is unable to eliminate false packets with short lifespan. Secondly, the algorithm lacks the capability to manage the trade-offs between false and true positives. Consequently, system administrators are frequently swamped with massive false alerts from intrusive packets that cannot achieve their objectives and unfortunately, such alerts are often mixed with few true positives. However, how to substantiate these two generic groups of alerts without incurring additional overheads are classical research issues. Therefore, we present clustering-based adaptive P-filter model to investigate false positives. Alerts from Snort were the input to the P-filter model and they were clustered with some sequential filtering criteria. Extensive evaluations that we performed have demonstrated high efficacy of our approach to collaborate with pattern matching algorithm in achieving significant reduction of false positives during intrusion detections.","","978-1-4244-5984-1","","10.1109/ISMS.2010.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416121","false positive;intrusion aggregation;pattern matching;time to live;true positive","Clustering algorithms;Collaboration;Detectors;Engines;Filtering;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Performance evaluation","computer network security;pattern clustering;pattern matching","Snort;clustering-based adaptive P-filter model;false positive reduction;network intrusion detection systems;pattern matching algorithm;sequential filtering criteria","","2","","25","","","27-29 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are three merits of this novel model. First, danger theory provides a method of 'grounding' the immune response to reduce false alarms. Second, each layer of the model can work independently and interact with each other, so the efficiency of detecting is greatly improved.

Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model.

Based on this, traffic from an identified attacker is redirected to an alternative server where damage can be mitigated. The advantage of this system is that it blocks intrusions in a manner transparent to the attacker and allows for observation and investigation of attacks in order to enable the administrator to take appropriate action.

One problem with current implementations, however, is the sheer number of alerts they can generate, many of which tend to be false alarms. This drawback makes effective use of such systems a challenging task. In this paper we explore three-dimensional approaches to visualizing network intrusion detection system alerts and aggregated network statistics in order to provide the system administrator with a better picture of the events occurring on his or her network. While some research has been done using two-dimensional concepts, 3D approaches have not received much attention with regard to detecting network intrusions. Evaluation of our visualizations using the 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set demonstrates the potential benefit of utilizing the third dimension.

This advanced computing paradigm, also known as the Internet of Things or cyber-physical computing, leads internet and computing to appear everywhere and anywhere using any device and location. With maximum appreciation and due regards to the evolutionary arc, depth and scope of ceaseless internet utilities, it is equally necessary to envisage the security and data confidentiality challenges posed by the free and ubiquitous availability of internet. Wireless communication, by virtue of a plethora of networked devices, is severely prone to illegal use, unauthorized access, protocol tunneling, eavesdropping, and denial of service attacks as these devices are unknowingly exposed to illegal access from undefined locations. Amidst the rapidly expanding arena of cybercrime, banks, stock exchanges, business transactions and shopping firms such as Amazon and eBay are heavily dependent on internet. The freedom offered by wireless and 3G based internet communication and its open character has led to many incidences of abuse of technology. Unrestricted accessibility to internet has intensified the likelihood of sophisticated attacks, malicious intrusions and malware, capable of inflicting widespread damage on modern human life and economy. The classical intrusion detection systems have been found to be less equipped to handle the magnitude and complexity of wireless networks due to enormous user activities and constantly varying behavior patterns. This paper analyses the role of computational intelligence techniques to design adaptive and cognitive intrusion detection systems that can efficiently detect malicious network activities and proposes novel three-tier archite- ture for designing intelligent intrusion detection systems for wireless networks.","","978-1-4799-1594-1","","10.1109/ICCIC.2013.6724156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6724156","IP address;MAC address;Pervasive computing;adaptation;attacks;computational intelligence;intrusion detection;wireless integration","Communication system security;Computational intelligence;IP networks;Internet;Security;Wireless networks","artificial intelligence;computer network security;radiocommunication;ubiquitous computing","3G based Internet communication;Amazon;Internet of Things;banks;business transactions;computational intelligence based intrusion detection systems;computing paradigm;cyber-physical computing;cybercrime;data confidentiality;eBay;malicious intrusions;malware;pervasive computing networks;shopping firms;sophisticated attacks;stock exchanges;wireless communication capability;wireless communication networks","","1","","14","","","26-28 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The behaviors of business applications on cloud are constantly evolving due to technical upgrading, cloud migration as well as social outbreaks. These changes bring the challenge of detecting anomalies during the change of applications on cloud. LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm has already been proven as the most promising outlier detection method for detecting network intrusions. To improve the performance of detection, LOF needs a complete set of normal behaviors of business applications, which is usually not available in cloud computing. We present an adaptive anomaly detection scheme for cloud computing based on LOF. Our scheme learns behaviors of applications both in training and detecting phase. It is adaptive to the change during detecting. The adaptability of our scheme reduces demand of efforts on collecting training data before detecting. It also enables the ability to detect contextual anomalies.

First, devices capable of detecting intrusions on high-speed links of 10 Gbps and higher are rather expensive, or must be built based on complex arrays. Second, legislation commonly restricts the way in which backbone network operators can analyse the data in their networks. To overcome these constraints, flow-based intrusion detection can be applied, which traditionally focuses only on packet header fields and packet characteristics.

The behavior of a host is checked continuously by the AD sensor and an alert is raised when the behavior deviates from its behavior profile. Unfortunately, the majority of AD sensors suffer from high volumes of false alerts either maliciously crafted by the host or originating from insufficient training of the sensor. We present a cluster-based AD sensor that relies on clusters of behavior profiles to identify anomalous behavior. The behavior of a host raises an alert only when a group of host profiles with similar behavior (cluster of behavior profiles) detect the anomaly, rather than just relying on the host's own behavior profile to raise the alert (single-profile AD sensor). A cluster-based AD sensor significantly decreases the volume of false alerts by providing a more robust model of normal behavior based on clusters of behavior profiles. Additionally, we introduce an architecture designed for the deployment of cluster-based AD sensors. The behavior profile of each network host is computed by its closest switch that is also responsible for performing the anomaly detection for each of the hosts in its subnet. By placing the AD sensors at the switch, we eliminate the possibility of hosts crafting malicious alerts.

Because traditional software alone pattern matching approaches can no longer meet the high throughput of today's networking, many hardware approaches are proposed to accelerate pattern matching. Among hardware approaches, memory-based architecture has attracted a lot of attention because of its easy reconfigurability and scalability. In order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful network intrusion detection system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement. For Snort rule sets, the new algorithm achieves 21% of memory reduction compared with the traditional Aho-Corasick algorithm. In addition, we can gain 24% of memory reduction by integrating our approach to the bit-split algorithm which is the state-of-the-art memory-based approach.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2028346","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5272427","Aho–Corasick (AC) algorithm;finite automata;pattern matching","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Decoding;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Scalability;Throughput","memory architecture;pattern matching;security of data","Snort rule sets;bit-split algorithm;hardware design;memory architecture;memory reduction;network intrusion detection system;packet content inspection;pattern matching algorithm;pattern matching approach","","3","","30","","2009-09-29","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, the need for dedicated Grid Intrusion Detection Systems (Grid-IDS) is motivated by giving such an example attack on a federated service protocol. A generic Grid-IDS architecture is presented as well as a concrete realization based on various Web services specifications. At the heart of the introduced Grid-IDS architecture is the correlation service, which receives the event information from sensors distributed across the federation and detects intrusions by analyzing and correlating the events. A protocol-aware correlation service is proposed, in which each service protocol is abstracted to a generic representation - a relationship of roles. Finally, based on the developed Grid-IDS and the gathered experiences, an approach towards intrusion tolerance is presented and discussed.","","978-1-4244-0974-7","978-1-4244-0975-4","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550328","Grid;Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Tolerance;SOA","Access protocols;Authentication;Authorization;Banking;Europe;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National electric code;Service oriented architecture","","","","0","","36","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, some issues like high false alarm rate, low detection rate and limited types of attacks which can be detected are still in existence so its wide applications in practice has been restricted. A new network anomaly detection method has been proposed in this paper. The main idea of the method is network traffic is analyzed and estimated by using Relative Entropy Theory (RET), and a network anomaly detection model based on RET is designed as well. The numerical value of relative entropy is used to alleviate the inherent contradictions between improving detection rate and reducing false alarm rate, which is more precise and can effectively reduce the error of estimation. On the 1999 DARPA/Lincoln Laboratory IDS evaluation data set, the detection results showed that the method can reach a higher detection rate at the premise of low false alarm rate.","","978-0-7695-3643-9","","10.1109/ISECS.2009.174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5209889","anomaly detection;evaluation data;intrusion detection;relative entropy theory","Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Detection algorithms;Electronic commerce;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Signal analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication traffic","intrusion detection;network anomaly detection method;network traffic;relative entropy theory","","2","","17","","","22-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Access controls are used to protect against malicious attacks and to ensure that established database privileges are not misused. Intrusion detection systems can augment these controls by alerting the intrusion response team after an attack has occurred. While intrusion detection can assist forensic analysis, a passive response to detection can permit the inflicted damage to go undetected for a long period of time, allowing the damage to potentially propagate. In contrast, we propose an adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system to secure the database from attacks. The approach requires the database to learn the activities considered normal using training data taken from production. The model adapts to stringent variations of the training data while in operation, reducing the potential for normal activities to be misclassified as malicious.","","","","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974450","Database;Database Security;Intrusion Prevention Systems;Security Algorithms","Databases;Intrusion detection;Production;Semantics;Syntactics;Training data","authorisation;data protection;database management systems;digital forensics","access controls;adaptive anomaly-based intrusion prevention system;database privileges;database roles;database security;fine-grained object access;forensic analysis;inflicted damage;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response team;malicious attacks protection;virtual private databases","","0","","18","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We employ MPM, since MPM has been shown a better performance, compared with RF in terms of model building time. To validate the feasibility, we carry out several times of experiments with KDD 1999 intrusion detection dataset.
