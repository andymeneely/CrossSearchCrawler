It needs to perform exact matching on multi-pattern signatures in real time. In this paper we introduce an efficient data structure called extended Bloom filter (EBF) and the corresponding algorithm to perform the multi-pattern signature matching. We also present a technique to support long signature matching so that we need only to maintain a limited number of supported signature lengths for the EBFs. We show that at reasonable hardware cost we can achieve very fast and almost time-deterministic exact matching for thousands of signatures. The architecture takes the advantages of embedded multi-port memories in FPGAs and can be used to build a full-featured hardware-based NIDS.","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577937","","Costs;Data structures;Hardware;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Payloads","Internet;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;handwriting recognition;nonlinear filters;pattern matching;security of data","FPGA;Internet;data structure;extended Bloom filter;hardware network intrusion detection systems;malicious attacks;multipattern signature matching;packet payload;time-deterministic exact matching","","10","7","16","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sleep deprivation attack is one of the most interesting attack in layer 2 where the attacker tries to use a low energy node until all its energy is exhausted and the node goes into permanent sleep. This attack is also possible in routing level. In OLSR low energy node declare their status through willingness property of HELLO message. Using this information an attacker node can choose that low energy node deliberately and forward all traffic through that node. This leads to low energy node in a permanent sleep mode.

This paper addresses the issue of identifying important input features in building an intrusion detection system (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless inputs leads to a simplification of the problem, faster and more accurate detection may result. Feature ranking and selection, therefore, is an important issue in intrusion detection. We apply the technique of deleting one feature at a time to perform experiments on SVMs and neural networks to rank the importance of input features for the DARPA collected intrusion data. Important features for each of the 5 classes of intrusion patterns in the DARPA data are identified. It is shown that SVM-based and neural network based IDSs using a reduced number of features can deliver enhanced or comparable performance.

International Conference on","20071105","2007","","","366","371","This paper discusses about a network anomaly detection system which is aimed at reduction of the number of false positives and negatives generated by conventional IDSs. A statistical model of the network activities is built using the payload and is trained with the normal behavior of user(s) in the network over a period of time. This model in-turn is used to detect deviations that are high from the expected behavior which indicate a security breach or a possible attack. The payload of the network traffic is analyzed by the system in an unsupervised manner and then classifies as normal traffic during training phase. The value-byte frequency of the application payload is calculated for each normal packet based on payload length and port number. The Mahalanobis distance and a similarity measure is then used to measure the similarity of the incoming data with the already computed values in the detection phase. This distance is then compared against a threshold value and generates an alert if it exceeds the value. In the clustering phase we provide a method to reduce the resource consumption which can easily update the stored profile using an incremental algorithm and the model is continuously updated so that it is accurate. The modeling method that is being followed is completely unsupervised and also tolerant to noise in the training data. The method proposed is also resistant to mimicry-attack. This system is designed to be integrated into other detectors in order to mitigate false positive rates so that this enriches the chances of detecting zero-day worms and new attack exploits","","1-4244-0997-7","1-4244-0997-7","10.1109/ICSCN.2007.350764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156646","","Clustering algorithms;Detectors;Frequency;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Phase detection;Phase measurement;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data;statistical analysis","IDS;Mahalanobis distance;clustering phase;false alarm rate;incremental learning algorithm;network anomaly detection system;network traffic;statistical model;value-byte frequency","","0","","15","","","22-24 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In view of the enormous computing power available in the present-day processors, deploying multiple IDSs in the same network to obtain best-of-breed solutions has been attempted earlier. The paper presented here addresses the problem of optimizing the performance of IDSs using sensor fusion with multiple sensors. The trade-off between the detection rate and false alarms with multiple sensors is highlighted. It is illustrated that the performance of the detector is better when the fusion threshold is determined according to the Chebyshev inequality. In the proposed data-dependent decision (DD) fusion method, the performance optimization of individual IDSs is first addressed. A neural network supervised learner has been designed to determine the weights of individual IDSs depending on their reliability in detecting a certain attack. The final stage of this DD fusion architecture is a sensor fusion unit which does the weighted aggregation in order to make an appropriate decision. This paper theoretically models the fusion of IDSs for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in performance, supplemented with the empirical evaluation.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2026954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159469","Chebyshev inequality;data-dependent decision (DD) fusion;intrusion detection systems (IDSs);neural network;sensor fusion","","Chebyshev approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;security of data;sensor fusion","Chebyshev inequality;best-of-breed;data-dependent decision;intrusion detection systems;multiple sensors;neural network;performance optimization;sensor fusion;supervised learning","","10","","27","","2009-07-07","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more popular in HTTP applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on compressed traffic. Based on the observations of DFA, we design a scheme to skip most of the matching process in the compressed parts of traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to design an efficient regular expression matching on compressed traffic. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The evaluation results show that our approach can reduce the number of state access in the DFA significantly.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5962596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5962596","","Automata;Computers;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","computer network security;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA-based regular expression matching;Snort;compressed traffic;deep packet inspection;layer-7 filtering;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection system;rule sets;traffic monitoring","","1","","25","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are usually deployed along with other preventive security mechanisms, such as access control and authentication, as a second line of defense that protects information systems. There are several reasons that make intrusion detection a necessary part of the entire defense system.

It is immense challenge for researcher to protect the mobile ad hoc network from the malicious node as topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious node can easily inject false routes into the network. A traditional method to detect such malicious nodes is to establish a base profile of normal network behavior and then identify a node's behavior to be anomalous if it deviates from the established profile. As the topology of a MANET constantly changes over time, the simple use of a static base profile is not efficient. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to detect the malicious node in MANET. In proposed method k-means clustering-based anomaly detection approach is used in which the profile is dynamically updated. The approach consists of three main phases: training, testing and updating. In training phase, the K-means clustering algorithm is used in order to establish a normal profile. In testing phase, check whether the current traffic of the node is normal or anomalous. If it is normal then update the normal profile otherwise isolate the malicious node and ignore that node from the network. To update the normal profile periodically, weighted coefficients and a forgetting equation is used.","","","","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155836","Dynamic Intrusion Detection System;K-means clustering;MANET","Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing;Testing;Training","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection approach;dynamic learning;intrusion detection approach;k-means clustering;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc network;network data;novel framework;security system;static base profile;surveillance system;topology node","","0","","16","","","26-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But solving a support vector machine problem is a typical quadratic optimization problem, which is influenced by the feature dimensions and number of training samples. Feature selection or attribution reduction can help reduce the SVM classification time and saving memory space effectively. This paper concerns using rough set for attribution ranking and reducing and using support vector machine for intrusion detection classification. An elicitation attribution reduction algorithm (EARA) based on attribution significance and discernibility matrix is presented and three data discretization algorithms were applied to identify the important attributions. The classification performance of the presented algorithm and classical SVM were compared in accuracy, time, false positive rate, and detection rate. The experiment results show the presented algorithm has ability to reduce the complexity of the structure of the support vector machine, simplify training sets and decrease training time and data storage without obviously sacrificing the detection correctness.","","978-0-7695-3881-5","","10.1109/WCSE.2009.776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403252","ID;Network Security;Rough Set;SV","Computer science;Electronic mail;Information science;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Set theory;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","SVM classification time;attribution ranking;attribution significance;data discretization;discernibility matrix;elicitation attribution reduction algorithm;feature selection;intrusion detection classification;intrusion detection classifier;quadratic optimization problem;rough set;support vector machine","","0","","10","","","28-30 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a technique that combines a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network with the well-known Kappa coefficient to perform feature selection.

The recent attack of `stuxnet' worm on the SCADA systems and nuclear power plants has posed a very critical threat to the existing security system. With new worms appearing at fast pace off late, conventional classification and defense techniques do not cover all worm attacks. So in this paper we propose a novel classification of worms which is much exhaustive as compared to earlier classifications, includes recent worm attacks and gives better and quicker understanding of recent worm behavior so that accurate defense mechanism can be designed very quickly. This paper discusses honeypot with signature based detection and honeypot with anomaly based detection. Further a novel hybrid scheme is proposed that integrates anomaly and signature detection with honeypot. Our proposed scheme combines detection scheme (i.e. signature based and anomaly based) with containment scheme, taking the advantages of both and hence developing an effective defense against Internet worms.

The authors first employed several techniques, that is, information gain (IG), wrapper with Bayesian networks (BN) and Decision trees (C4.5), to select important subsets of features for network intrusion detection based on KDD'99 data. The authors then validate the feature selection schemes in a real network test bed to detect distributed denial-of-service attacks. The feature selection schemes are extensively evaluated based on the two data sets. The empirical results demonstrate that with only the most important 10 features selected from all the original 41 features, the attack detection accuracy almost remains the same or even becomes better based on both BN and C4.5 classifiers.

The network security is a prominent feature of the network ensuring accountability, confidentiality, integrity, and protection against many external and internal threats. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a type of security software designed to automatically alert administrators when someone or something is trying to compromise information system through malicious activities or through security policy violations.

The various personal information sharing practices that social network providers promote have led to their success as innovative social interaction platforms. At the same time, these practices have risen much critique and concerns with respect to privacy and security from different stakeholders. In fact, the massive use of online social networks has risen the attention of hackers and attackers that want to propagate malware and viruses for obtaining sensitive data. In this way, every social network user should be able to easily access, control and analyse the information he shares on his profile in order to efficiently detect any usage deviation. The possibility of detecting different sources of shared information in the same account lead us to design a system based not on information itself but on the timestamps associated to it. The proposed event collector framework can collect all posted information and store it in a relational database for further analysis. Using a friendly graphical interface, users can access all stored information in a comprehensible manner, according to the type of event, thus facilitating the analysis of the user behaviour. Since each event is stored with its corresponding timestamp, it is possible to perform an efficient analysis of all posted contents, compute statistics over collected data, infer/establish the so called ""normal"" or ""typical"" usage profile and, thus, be able to detect possible deviations that may correspond to a compromised user account.","","","","10.1109/NETWKS.2014.6959218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6959218","Monitoring Framework;Social networks;User Behaviour Modelling","Databases;Facebook;Privacy;Security;Servers;Web pages","graphical user interfaces;relational databases;social networking (online)","daily digital interactions;graphical user interface;innovative social interaction platforms;relational database;social network events collection;user behaviour analysis","","0","","11","","","17-19 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are some approaches suggested for anomaly detection in MANETs that most of them are static and use a predefined model. Due to the dynamic characteristics of MANETs, they cannot be applied to these networks well. In this paper we have proposed a one-class SVM for dynamic anomaly detection in mobile ad-hoc networks with AODV routing protocol, called ManetSVM. The efficiency of ManetSVM for detection of flooding, blackhole, neighbour, rushing, and wormhole attacks has been evaluated.

In many applications, it is important to take into account some extra knowledge in addition to the one encoded by the classifier. For example, in spam filtering which can be seen as a classification problem, it can make sense for a user to require that the spam filter predicts less than a given rate or number of spams. In this paper, we propose an approach allowing to combine expert knowledge with the results of a decision tree classifier. More precisely, we propose to revise the outputs of a decision tree in order to take into account the available expert knowledge. Our approach can be applied for any classifier where a probability distribution over the set of classes (or decisions) can be estimated from the output of the classification step. In this work, we analyze the advantage of adding expert knowledge to decision tree classifiers in the context of intrusion detection and alert correlation. In particular, we study how additional expert knowledge such as ""it is expected that 80% of traffic will be normal"" can be integrated in classification tasks. Our aim is to revise classifiers' outputs in order to fit the expert knowledge.

It acts as an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) for the human body and detects anomalies that make the body deviate from its normal behavior. This inspired researchers to build artificial immune systems (AISes) which imitate the behavior of the HIS and are capable of protecting hosts or networks from attacks. An artificial immune system (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period. Although several AISes have been proposed, only a few make use of collaborative approaches. In this paper we propose P2P-AIS, a P2P approach for AISes in which peers exchange intrusion detection experience in order to enhance attack detection and mitigation. P2P-AIS implements Chord as a distributed hash table (DHT) protocol to organize the peers.","","978-1-4244-4623-0","978-1-4244-4624-7","10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5307053","artificial immune systems;distributed denial of service;intrusion detection;peer-to-peer systems","Artificial immune systems;Broadcasting;Computer crime;Computer science;Error correction;Floods;Humans;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protocols","artificial immune systems;cryptographic protocols;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Chord;DDoS flooding attacks;P2P-AIS;artificial immune system;distributed hash table protocol;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention system","","0","","20","","","23-26 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, MANET is venerable to attacks due to its mobile and ad hoc natures. The security issue is becoming a main concern in the applications of MANET. We consider the problem of decreasing the number of false positives generated by cooperative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection techniques, a hierarchical distributed model of multi-level detection intrusion is proposed. The model utilizes the intelligent, lightweight mobile agent as alternative to the client server distribution model and nonoverlapping zone framework. So it can effectively detect complicated attacks. The data collection, data analysis, alert message and alarm message can be achieved by using mobile agents, which may reduce the data transmission to save the bandwidth resource in the MANET. The model can adjust itself dynamically to adapt to the change of the external environmental. Also the model is robust and scalable.","","978-1-4244-2282-1","978-1-4244-2283-8","10.1109/CANET.2008.4655310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4655310","","Communication system security;Data analysis;Data communication;Intelligent agent;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Network servers;Packet radio networks;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile agents;security of data","mobile ad hoc networks;mobile agent intrusion detection system;multi-hop packet radio network","","1","","10","","","23-25 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier.

The key concept is to represent system calls as states of kernel modules, analyze the state interactions, and identify anomalies by comparing the probabilities of occurrences of states in normal and anomalous traces. In addition, the proposed technique allows a visual understanding of system behaviour, and hence a more informed decision making. We evaluated this technique on Linux based programs of UNM datasets and a new modern Firefox dataset. We created the Firefox dataset on Linux using contemporary test suites and hacking techniques.

In this paper, we consider distributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange data with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most existing DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups or coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged. However, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be involved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping coalitions. Here, we address this problem using novel techniques from a class of cooperative games, known as overlapping coalition formation games, and based on the game model, we propose a distributed DCS algorithm in which the SUs self-organize into a desirable network structure with overlapping coalitions. Simulation results show that the proposed overlapping algorithm yields significant performance improvements, decreasing the total error probability up to 25% in the Q<sub>m</sub> + Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the missed detection probability up to 20% in the Q<sub>m</sub>/Q<sub>f</sub> criterion, the overhead up to 80%, and the total report number up to 10%, compared with the state-of-the-art non-overlapping algorithm.","0090-6778","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2350503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881693","Cognitive radio;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing","Bandwidth;Cascading style sheets;Cognitive radio;Detectors;Games;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;game theory;signal detection","cognitive radio network;common fusion center;cooperative games;cooperative spectrum sensing;distributed sensing;multiple cooperative coalition;overlapping coalition formation;secondary user","","0","","37","","2014-08-21","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE","20070212","2006","","","1","7","Several approaches have been proposed for intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks. Most of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected ad hoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. Using a traditional intrusion detection and mitigation scheme designed for well-connected ad hoc networks, the delivery ratio in a sparsely connected ad hoc network (50 nodes over 2000times2000 m <sup>2</sup>) can only improve from 76.5% to 79.9% with selective dropping attacks. Thus, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks. Our simulation results indicate that our new ferry-based scheme is more effective than the traditional mitigation schemes that are used for well-connected mobile ad hoc networks. Our FBIDM scheme reduces the impact of the data dropping attacks performed by malicious nodes in a sparsely connected ad hoc network. Without any mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio is 76.5% with selective dropping attacks. With FBIDM, the system achieves a delivery ratio that ranges from 87% (with a single ferry) to 93% (with four ferries) with selective dropping attacks. Without the mitigation scheme, the delivery ratio with black hole attacks drops to 65.9%. With FBIDM, the achieved delivery ratio ranges from 82.9% (with a single ferry) to 91.9% (with four ferries) with black hole attacks","","1-4244-0617-X","1-4244-0618-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086633","DSR;DoS resilience;disruption tolerant networkst;intrusion detection;routing;sparsely connected adhoc networks","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Resilience;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;security of data","FBIDM scheme;ferry-based intrusion detection-mitigation scheme;mobile ad hoc network;sparsely connected network","","3","","17","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new integrated approach is presented for building future, network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS). We integrate the Snort (a NIDS) with a custom-designed anomaly detection system (ADS) to yield a powerful cyber defense system, called CAIDS. This system detects known attacks through signature matching and reveals network anomalies by Internet traffic data mining. The CAIDS design integrates two different detection engines for alert correlation between intrusions and anomalies. We aim to automate signature generation into Snort database. The system was tested over an Internet trace of 24 millions of packets containing 200 attacks. Our simulation experiments result in a 75% detection rate on all attacks with a low 5% false alarm rate. The system generates alerts on both intrusive attacks to distributed resources and anomalies detected in the Internet, intranet, and extranet connections.","","0-7695-2312-9","","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420251","","Buildings;Data mining;Distributed computing;Extranets;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;computer network management;data mining;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic data mining;Snort;automatic signature matching;cyber defense system;distributed computing system;network anomalies detection system;network security breach;network-based intrusion detection system","","4","","16","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These coordinated attacks can be difficult to detect at an early stage, since the evidence of the attack may be widely distributed across different subnetworks in the Internet. A critical issue for research is how to detect these large scale attacks by correlating information from multiple intrusion detection systems in an efficient manner. Several collaborative detection systems have been proposed in the literature. However, these proposals have lacked large scale testing in real networks, and the practicalities of how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of these systems has not been demonstrated. To address these challenges, we propose LarSID, a scalable decentralized large scale intrusion detection framework. LarSID provides a service for defending against attacks by sharing potential evidence of intrusions between participant intrusion detection systems via a distributed hash table (DHT) architecture. In particular, we investigate how to optimize the trade-off between detection accuracy and reaction time of LarSID based on an analysis of a large, real-world intrusion detection dataset (DShield Dataset), which has been collected from over 1600 firewall administrators across the world. LarSID has been deployed and tested on the PlanetLab testbed, and is built on top of OpenDHT - a public DHT service. Our experimental results show significant reductions in detection latency compared to a centralized detection architecture. Currently, LarSID has been deployed on 128 PlanetLab nodes as a large scale intrusion detection service.","","1-4244-0798-2","1-4244-0799-0","10.1109/INM.2007.374772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258524","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Testing","Internet;cryptography;groupware;software architecture","Internet;OpenDHT;collaborative intrusion detection;decentralized architecture;distributed hash table;network intrusion detection","","12","2","38","","","May 21 2007-Yearly 25 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due to their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on cooperative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. Among the various attacks to which MANETs are vulnerable, malicious packet dropping attack is very common where a malicious node can partially degrade or completely disrupt communication in the network by consistently dropping packets. In this paper, a mechanism for detection of packet dropping attack is presented based on cooperative participation of the nodes in a MANET. The redundancy of routing information in an ad hoc network is utilized to make the scheme robust so that it works effectively even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed scheme is fully cooperative and thus more secure as the vulnerabilities of any election algorithm used for choosing a subset of nodes for cooperation are absent. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the protocol.","","978-1-4244-1094-1","978-1-4244-1094-1","10.1109/ICTMICC.2007.4448606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4448606","distributed algorithm;mobile ad hoc network;packet dropping attack;routing security","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Degradation;Femtocell networks;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Robustness;Routing;Spread spectrum communication","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ad hoc network;distributed protocol;mobile nodes;multihop mobile ad hoc networks;network security;packet dropping attack;routing information","","6","3","7","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, for a comprehensive intranet security strategy, such defenses alone may not be enough. An enterprise needs mechanisms to analyze alerts and detect real attacks, and policies on how to respond to attacks. A framework for effective response to detection of misuse or attack is a central theme. The focus is towards security of corporate intranets. We first discuss the access control models that are currently being deployed and used at most intranet solutions. Using role based access control as a base, we develop a framework of interaction of various entities in the model. We then propose a prioritization scheme based on cost of impact in case of misuse and business criticality of transactions. The scheme is developed based on categorization and prioritization of risk and vulnerability assessment results for an enterprise intranet. Alerts are a critical element of a real-time response, but how alert engines operate and filter tons of log data decides the effectiveness of such infrastructure. We propose incorporation of priority schemes into alert mechanisms to develop a more effective intrusion countermeasure against misuse and attack. It leverages the enterprise's investment in security technology to develop an optimized solution to respond to those attacks, by advising the enterprise's on-site administrators.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232418","","Access control;Authorization;Computer science;Costs;Data security;Filters;Information security;Investments;Search engines;USA Councils","authorisation;business communication;computer crime;intranets;risk management","access control model;alert engines;alert mechanism;business transaction;corporate intranet;enterprise intranet;enterprise security;intranet access security;intrusion countermeasures;prioritization scheme;real-time response;risk assessment;role based access control","","0","","9","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Congress on","20090529","2009","","","2029","2035","In the paper we present a novel approach based on applying a modern metaheuristic Gene Expression Programming (GEP) to detecting web application attacks. This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and web server mechanisms to put them in a web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.","","978-1-4244-2958-5","978-1-4244-2959-2","10.1109/CEC.2009.4983190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4983190","","Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Web server","SQL;genetic algorithms;online front-ends;query processing;security of data","SQL;Web application attack detection;Web browser;Web server mechanisms;data retrieval;intrusion detection problem;metaheuristic gene expression programming","","1","","15","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the result of clusters can be obtained by repeating the computation process. Because affiliating matrix, obtained by the introduction of SVM into FCM, is defined to be the fuzzy membership function, each different input data sample can have different penalty value, and the separating hyper-plane is optimized.

A new approach to system call monitoring based on authenticated system calls is introduced. An authenticated system call is a system call augmented with extra arguments that specify the policy for that call and a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) that guarantees the integrity of the policy and the system call arguments. This extra information is used by the kernel to verify the system call. The version of the application in which regular system calls have been replaced by authenticated calls is generated automatically by an installer program that reads the application binary, uses static analysis to generate policies, and then rewrites the binary with the authenticated calls. This paper presents the approach, describes a prototype implementation based on Linux and the PLTO binary rewriting system, and gives experimental results suggesting that the approach is effective in protecting against compromised applications at modest cost.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467810","Intrusion tolerance;compiler techniques;operating systems;sandboxing;security policy","Application software;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Costs;Cryptography;Kernel;Message authentication;Protection;Prototypes","Linux;cryptography;data integrity;formal verification;message authentication;program compilers;program diagnostics;rewriting systems","Linux;binary rewriting system;cryptographic message authentication code;data integrity;static analysis;system call argument;system call authentication;system call monitor;system call verification","","7","3","24","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence a wireless intrusion signature may be as simple as say a changed MAC address or jamming signal to as complicated as session hijacking. Therefore merely managing and cross verifying the patterns from an intrusion source are difficult in such a network. Beside the difficulty of detecting the intrusion at different layers, the network credential varies from node to node due to factors like mobility, congestion, node failure and so on. Hence conventional techniques for intrusion detection fail to prevail in wireless networks. Therefore in this work we device a unique agent based technique to gather information from various nodes and use this information with an evolutionary artificial immune system to detect the intrusion and prevent the same via bypassing or delaying the transmission over the intrusive paths.

"A graph-based clustering algorithm for anomaly intrusion detection","Zhou Mingqiang; Huang Hui; Wang Qian","Coll. of Comput.

So as one of important techniques of data mining, clustering is an important means for intrusion detection. Due to the disadvantages of traditional clustering methods for intrusion detection, this paper presents a graph-based intrusion detection algorithm by using outlier detection method that based on local deviation coefficient (LDCGB). Compared to other intrusion detection algorithm of clustering, this algorithm is unnecessary to initial cluster number. Meanwhile, it is robust in the outlier's affection and able to detect any shape of cluster rather that the circle one only. Moreover, it still has stable rate of detection on unknown or muted attacks. LDCGB uses graph-based cluster algorithm (GB) to get an initial partition of data set which is depended on parameter of cluster precision rather than initial cluster number. On the other hand, because of this intrusion detection model is based on mixed training dataset, so it must have high label accuracy to guarantee its performance. Therefore, in labeling phrase, the algorithm imposes outlier detection algorithm of local deviation coefficient to label the result of GB algorithm again. This measure is able to improve the labeling accuracy. The detection rate and false positive rate are obtained after the algorithm is tested by the KDDCup99 data set. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm could get a satisfactory performance.","","978-1-4673-0241-8","","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295306","Graph-based clustering;cluster precision;intrusion detection;labeling accuracy;outlier detection","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms;Shape","data mining;graph theory;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCup99 data set;LDCGB;anomaly intrusion detection system;data mining;graph-based clustering algorithm;graph-based intrusion detection algorithm;initial cluster number;local deviation coefficient;mixed training dataset;muted attacks;outlier affection;outlier detection method;unknown attacks","","1","","14","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to keep up with the ever-higher line speed, recent research trend is to implement scan detection in fast but small SRAM. This leads to a difficult technical challenge because the amount of traffic to be monitored is huge but the on-die memory space for performing such a monitoring task is very limited. We propose an efficient scan detection scheme based on dynamic bit sharing, which incorporates probabilistic sampling and bit sharing for compact information storage. We design a maximum likelihood estimation method to extract persource information from the shared bits in order to determine the scanners. Our new scheme ensures that the false positive/false negative ratios are bounded with high probability. Moreover, given an arbitrary set of bounds, we develop a systematic approach to determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the amount of memory needed to meet the bounds. Experiments based on a real Internet traffic trace demonstrate that the proposed scan detection scheme reduces memory consumption by three to twenty times when comparing with the best existing work.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-9919-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935169","","Electrostatic discharge;Maximum likelihood estimation;Memory management;Probabilistic logic;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Security","Internet;maximum likelihood detection;probability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","compact information storage;high-speed network;intrusion detection system;maximum likelihood estimation;memory consumption;on-die memory space;optimal dynamic bit sharing;probabilistic sampling;probability;real Internet traffic trace;scan detection","","1","","20","","","10-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new method for anomaly intrusion detection is proposed based on linear prediction and Markov chain model. Linear prediction is employed to extract features from system calls sequences of the privileged processes which are used to make up of the character database of those processes, and then the Markov chain model is founded based on those features. The observed behavior of the system is analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov chain model of the norm profile supports the observed behavior. A low probability of support indicates an anomalous behavior that may result from intrusive activities. The experiments show this method is effective and efficient, and can be used in practice to monitor the computer system in real time.","","0-7803-8273-0","","10.1109/WCICA.2004.1342339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1342339","","Computer science;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Handwriting recognition;Intrusion detection;Predictive models;Spatial databases","Markov processes;computer networks;security of data","Markov chain model;behavioral model;character database;computer system monitoring;feature extraction;intrusion detection;linear prediction model;network security","","2","","6","","","15-19 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","14","23","Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) attempt to identify attacks by comparing collected data to predefined signatures known to be malicious (misuse-based IDSs) or to a model of legal behavior (anomaly-based IDSs). Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behavior, which may result in a large number of false alarms. Almost all current anomaly-based intrusion detection systems classify an input event as normal or anomalous by analyzing its features, utilizing a number of different models. A decision for an input event is made by aggregating the results of all employed models. We have identified two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems. One is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs in the decision phase. Often, only the sum of the model results is calculated and compared to a threshold. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. This additional information can be related to the models, such as the confidence in a model's output, or can be extracted from external sources. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose an event classification scheme that is based on Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of different model outputs and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the event classification process is significantly improved using our proposed approach.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254306","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Operating systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","belief networks;computer crime;message authentication;pattern classification","Bayesian event classification;Bayesian networks;anomaly-based IDS;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;input event decision;misuse-based IDS;model output aggregation;predefined malicious signatures","","30","1","26","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type ""opportunistic adversaries"". This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions. Experimental results show that our algorithm has higher detection accuracy than other approaches based on outlier detection or change-point detection.","2166-0778","978-1-4673-2318-5","978-0-7695-4770-1","10.1109/SRII.2012.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310988","Anomaly detection;Machine learning;Opportunistic adversary","Automation;Business;Decision trees;Humans;Insurance;Machine learning;Training","business data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","change-point detection;countermeasure algorithm;human decision processes;imminent threats;machine-learning-based business process automation;misclassification cases;opportunistic adversaries;outlier detection;post-classification data distributions;real-world classification problems;reduced classification accuracy","","0","","20","","","24-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
