It intends to verify if networking of heterogeneous sensors in WSN improves the system reliability and security. Unlike many other reported approaches, which employ conventional networking intrusion detection techniques in a WSN environment, this paper presents methods specific to sensor networks. They are designed to take an advantage of receiving sensor signals from networked sensors by building the models of the sensor signals and, on the higher network levels, objects under measurement. The methods are based on statistical processing of the measurement results coming from sensors and employing those models to detect the anomalies caused either by an equipment malfunctioning or human malicious activities and mistakes. Three algorithms are examined and implemented with SunSpot sensor kits produced by Sun Corp. Their performance in two intrusion activities executed on real sensor networks is analyzed.","1930-0395","978-1-4244-4548-6","978-1-4244-5335-1","10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5398525","","Acoustic sensors;Base stations;Computer science;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Protection;Sensor systems;Vibration measurement;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Sun Corp;SunSpot sensor;WSN;heterogeneous sensors networking;intrusion detection methods;statistical processing;system reliability;system security;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","25-28 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While it is well-understood that operational conditions may differ from test conditions, little attention has been paid to the question of assessing the effect on IDS results of parameter estimation errors resulting from these differences. In this paper we consider this question in the context of multi-step attacks. We derive simulated distributions of the posterior probability of exploit given the observation of a series of alerts and bounds on the posterior uncertainty given a particular distribution of the model parameters. Knowledge of such bounds introduces the novel prospect of a confidence versus agility tradeoff in IDS administration. Such a tradeoff could give administrators flexibility in IDS configuration, allowing them to choose detection confidence at the price of detection latency, according to organizational priorities.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721564","Bayesian network;Intrusion detection;Probabilistic inference","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer security;Expert systems;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Phase detection;System testing;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;parameter estimation;probability;security of data","inference uncertainty;intrusion detection system;low base rate address;parameter estimation error;posterior probability distribution;test condition;uncertainty-bounding multistep analysis","","0","1","11","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731","Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine","Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput","deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching","ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching","","1","","30","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Even if a lot of research was already done on this topic, the perfect IDS has still not been found and it stays a hot and challenging area in computer security research. This paper presents a simple and robust method for intrusion detection in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA) where each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is then employed to reduce the high dimensional data vectors and thus, detection is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. Our experiments with the KDD Cup 99 dataset, although not yet completed, have shown that this approach is promising in terms of detection accuracy. It is also effective to identify most known attacks as well as new attacks.

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead. On a 1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine with gigabit Ethernet interfaces, the throughput of the CTCP router is 420.3 Mbits/sec, whereas the throughput of a generic Linux router on the same hardware is only 409.1 Mbits/sec.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377240","","Computer crime;Fingerprint recognition;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;RAKE receivers;Sockets;TCPIP;Throughput","Internet;Linux;open systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine;CTCP router prototype;Internet;Linux kernel;OS fingerprinting;gigabit Ethernet interface;network security;transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture","","2","","39","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evolutionary approaches play an important role in identifying attacks with high detection rates and low false discovery rates. In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. Multi-objective PSO approach is used for feature selection from a set of 41 features and Random Forests (RF), a highly accurate and fast algorithm, is used for classification. Empirical results show that the proposed technique outperforms well-known classification and regression techniques in most of the cases.","","","","10.1109/SMC.2013.422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722175","Intrusion detection;Multi-objective optimization;Particle swarm optimization (PSO);Random forests (RF)","Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Probes;Radio frequency;Training;Vectors;Vegetation","authorisation;data mining;evolutionary computation;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;random processes;regression analysis","KDD99Cup dataset;PROBE attacks detection;evolutionary approach;false discovery rate;feature selection;hybrid technique;intrusion detection rate;intrusion prevention system;multiobjective PSO approach;multiobjective particle swarm optimization approach;network intrusions;network resource manipulation;network security;pattern classification;random forests;regression techniques;unauthorized access","","2","","20","","","13-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional way for intrusion prevention is done by pure software solution with high performance CPU. However, this method is out of date, when gigabit network is booming and the high performance throughput is required. In recent years, the programmable hardware solutions have been proposed but they cannot deal with deep and large amount of pattern matching and are lack of flexibility when signatures are growing up. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern-matching coprocessor that overcomes the difficulties in TCAM implementation when pattern length is deep and signature set is large. Since patterns are all stored in TCAM, it is a scalable and flexible system.","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577957","","Communication system security;Computer viruses;Coprocessors;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;National security;Pattern matching;Throughput","computer networks;coprocessors;pattern matching;security of data;telecommunication security","gigabit network;network intrusion prevention system;network security system;pattern matching coprocessor;programmable hardware solutions;signature set;ternary content addressable memory","","1","","13","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address the above issue, a two-step feature selection algorithm is proposed in this paper. Depending on the definition of relevant feature and redundant feature and using mutual information as criterion, it firstly eliminates the irrelevant features and then eliminates the redundant features. With low time complexity, the feature selection algorithm independent of detection algorithm could easily balance the detection accuracy and the number of features through threshold. Experiments over networks connection records from authoritative data set KDD CUP 1999 were implemented for several detection algorithms to evaluate the proposed method.

A weakness of these techniques is that they focus on control flows involving system calls, but not their arguments. This weakness makes them susceptible to several classes of attacks, including attacks on security-critical data, race-condition and symbolic link attacks, and mimicry attacks. To address this weakness, we develop a new approach for learning dataflow behaviors of programs. The novelty in our approach, as compared to previous system-call argument learning techniques, is that it learns temporal properties involving the arguments of different system calls, thus capturing the flow of security-sensitive data through the program. An interesting aspect of our technique is that it can be uniformly layered on top of most existing control-flow models, and can leverage control-flow contexts to significantly increase the precision of dataflows captured by the model. This contrasts with previous system-call argument learning techniques that did not leverage control-flow information, and moreover, were focused on learning statistical properties of individual system call arguments. Through experiments, we show that temporal properties enable detection of many attacks that aren't detected by previous approaches. Moreover, they support formal reasoning about security assurances that can be provided when a program follows its dataflow behavior model, e.g., tar would read only files located within a directory specified as a command-line argument","1081-6011","0-7695-2574-1","","10.1109/SP.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624000","","Computer science;Context modeling;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning automata;Web server","data flow analysis;security of data","control flows;dataflow anomaly detection;dataflow behavior model;dataflow program behaviors;formal reasoning;intrusion detection;mimicry attacks;race-condition attacks;security-critical data attacks;security-sensitive data;symbolic link attacks;system call arguments;system calls","","21","2","35","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender. Examples are presented and discussed both analytically and numerically.","8164-9547","1-4244-0355-3","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024492","","Computer security;Face detection;Game theory;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Minimax techniques;Nash equilibrium;Neural networks;Payloads","","","","2","","19","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To protect such archives, we propose a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive intrusion detection system. As a first step towards building such a system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior, this model exhibits a low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks) while still detecting most attacks.

This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system. Our model is capable of tracking changes in the data distribution in the monitored environment.

In the learning phase tokens are passed to recurrent neural network (RNN) trained by back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm.

Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each time. The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses. Asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the composite hypotheses case, where there is uncertainty in the distribution parameters. Simulation results then illustrate the performance of the algorithms.","","","","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6736855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736855","Anomaly detection;intrusion detection;sequential hypothesis testing","Approximation methods;Error probability;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Testing;Uncertainty","computer network security;minimisation;probability;statistical testing","abnormal components;abnormal independent component;abnormal state;anomalous component;anomaly localization;asymptotically optimal low-complexity algorithms;component priorities;composite hypothesis;distribution parameter uncertainty;distribution parameters;error probability constraints;expected weighted completion time sum minimization;independent model;normal component;optimal index policies;overall network damage reduction;resource-constrained cyber network","","4","","24","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection of attacks on a particular network is not an easy task. Since recently, several machine learning, pattern classification and evolutionary techniques have been used on KDD99Cup dataset for detecting different kinds of intrusions that exist in the dataset. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA)-based technique for detecting Remote-to-Local (R-to-L) attacks in the network. The problems in other techniques with accuracy, false positive rates and speed have been resolved by using incremental GA in our proposed mechanism. We extract features from the dataset and build rules upon them to identify the attacks. The speed of training and testing is reduced by using less number of features in the incremental GA. The results of the R-to-L Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are rechecked for confirmation by using two more detection systems. The latter detection systems make sure that a particular record identified by the first IDS is really an R-to-L attack. The overall system's false positive rates are decreased and detection rates are increased. The model is verified on the dataset taken from KDD99Cup which is a standard dataset used for intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-8862-9","978-0-9564263-6-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678024","","","computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","IDS;R-to-L intrusion detection system;evolutionary techniques;feature extraction;incremental genetic algorithm;machine learning;network security;pattern classification;remote-to-local attack detection;standard dataset","","0","","18","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examining players' best responses, the solution of the game follows by locating all the Nash Equilibria (NE). We extend the NE notion to the logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), to capture players' bounded rationality.

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.","","978-1-4244-8448-5","978-0-7695-4236-2","10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852","ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence","Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation","computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems","biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator","","0","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) solutions are one of such applications that have dramatically been transformed. This is mainly due to increasing number of attacks as well as sophisticated nature of today's intrusions. Moreover, it has been shown that various critical components of a system can be targeted. This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion. We call our proposed DIDS model Consultative Trusted Computing-based Collaborative IDS (CTC IDS).

In the present trend of self-organizing and self-protecting system, a special type of IDS that operates by non-supervised learning is an interesting approach. This type of IDS is able to extract models of behavior of the environment without the need of prior knowledge about attacks or signatures. One of the techniques used to create such models is data clustering, where patterns of data access are collected and grouped to create IDS rules. In this paper we focus on the development of a non-supervised IDS for protecting Web servers from attacks using malicious HTTP access patterns. We propose a heuristic method for assigning labels to groups considering simultaneously the source and the content of the HTTP requests. The proposed method is completely self-organized, and does not require configuration or signature updates to prepare the IDS to detect new forms of attacks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method yield fewer false positive alerts when compared to similar non-supervised methods in the literature.","","978-1-4673-6425-6","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632070","Intrusion detection;anomaly-based detection;clustering;security","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Training;Web servers","Internet;file servers;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;self-adjusting systems;statistical analysis;transport protocols","HTTP access patterns;clustering-based method;data clustering;heuristic method;intrusion detection systems;nonsupervised IDS;nonsupervised learning;protecting Web servers;self-organizing system;self-protecting system;web servers","","0","","19","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers have proposed a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques to address SQLIAs, but all existing solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness and practicality. %In particular, We claim that the main cause of such limitations is reliance on a single detection model and/or on information generated by a single source. Correlation of information from diverse sources has been proven to be an effective approach for improving detection performance, i.e. reducing both the rate of false positives and the percentage of undetected intrusions. In order to do so, we collect symptoms of attacks against web-based applications at different architectural layers, and correlate them via a systematic approach that applies a number of different anomaly detection models to combine data from multiple feeds, which are located in different locations within the system, and convey information which is diverse in nature. Preliminary experimental results show that, by rearranging alerts based on knowledge about the ability of individual security probes of spotting a specific malicious action, the proposed approach does indeed reduce false positives rates and increase the detection coverage.","","978-1-4244-4678-0","978-0-7695-3760-3","10.1109/LADC.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234325","Anomaly Detection;Correlation;Information Diversity;Intrusion Detection;SQL Injection Attacks","Cryptography;Data security;Encapsulation;Encoding;Feeds;Information resources;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Probes","security of data","Web applications;false positives;individual security probes;security threats;single detection model;specific malicious action;symptom correlation approach;undetected intrusions;weight-based symptom correlation approach","","3","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536","intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering","Costs;Engines;Face detection;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Reconfigurable architectures;Scalability;Software performance;Throughput","computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security","DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture","","1","","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20070813","2007","","","1211","1216","Attacks against encrypted protocols are becoming increasingly popular. They pose a serious challenge to the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which heavily rely on inspecting the network packet fields and are consequently unable to monitor encrypted sessions. IDSs can be broadly categorized into two types: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. The signature-based IDSs rely on previous attack signatures but are often ineffective against new attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based detection systems depend on detecting the change in the protocol behavior caused by an attack. The latter can be employed to detect novel attacks, and therefore are often preferred over their signature-based counterpart. In this paper, we envision an anomaly-based IDS which can detect attacks against popular encrypted protocols, such as SSH and SSL. The proposed system creates a normal behavior profile and uses non-parametric Cusum algorithm to detect deviation from the normal profile. Upon detecting an anomaly, the proposed mechanism generates an alert, sets a delay to the protocol response, and traces back the attacker.

We examine these issues in the context of a prototype distributed detector for self-contained, in-band wormholes in OLSR networks. We propose an opportunistic voting algorithm and present test results from a 48-node testbed in which colluding attackers generate corroborating false accusations against pairs of innocent nodes.

In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times.

The SPS consists of a spoofing detection module which is installed on the security center in the HAN, as well as spoofing prevention agents installed on network nodes. Once an attack is detected, the agents differentiate and filter malicious frames by analyzing the RSS values of received frames. Two methods are introduced and investigated for attack prevention, static threshold and dynamic threshold. The former has very low computational requirements, yet due to high false positive rate introduces some network overhead during the attack.

Each anomalous component of the system incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Different anomalous components may incur different costs depending on their criticality to the system. Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each given time. The observations from a probed component are realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. The objective is a probing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost, incurred by all the components during the detection process, under reliability constraints. We consider both independent and exclusive models. In the former, each component can be abnormal with a certain probability independent of other components. In the latter, one and only one component is abnormal. We develop optimal index policies under both models.

Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that the vast majority of common abnormal data represent attack vectors rather than false positives.

We seek to identify the optimal length of a trust chain among peers in a trust Web so as to maximize the trust levels for peers on the trust chain, by trading off trust space for trust level. The cognitive nodes in the network can dynamically adapt to changing network environments by adjusting their design parameter settings over time to establish an acceptable trust level with other nodes.

Confidentiality is the most important point of information security with respect to integrity and availability in cloud computing especially in financial, governmental and military usage. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) service increases the cloud's security level. In this paper, a hybrid approach is introduced that can be used in cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers or untrusted employees in a circular chain protection model. This model is proposed over an existing model, AdjointVM, which uses three types of technologies (trusted computing, host-based IDS, virtual machine monitor based IDS) to tackle external and internal threats in cloud systems. The proposed model claims to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, and aims to build a more secure cloud environment for the users by adding additional security mechanism between VMs. In the proposed model, responsibility of confidentiality is not giving up only to the providers or cloud administrators, a VM can protect another VM in a circular manner and this results a chain structure and constructs a circular structure to enhance global security of the system. At the same time, users can also manage and monitor their own confidentiality by themselves.","","978-1-4673-5612-1","","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557202","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Authentication;Computational modeling;Computer hacking;Cryptography;Military computing;Monitoring","cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;trusted computing;virtual machines","AdjointVM;circular chain VM protection model;cloud administrators;cloud computing security level;cloud providers;corporate areas;external threats;host-based IDS;information availability;information confidentiality;information integrity;information security;internal threats;intrusion detection system service;private areas;trusted computing;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees;virtual machine monitor-based IDS","","2","","16","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is difficult to prevent because DDoS attacker send spoofing packets to victim which makes the identification of the origin of attacks very difficult. A series of techniques have been studied such as pattern matching by learning the attack pattern and abnormal traffic detection. However, pattern matching approach is not reliable because attackers always set attacks of different traffic patterns and pattern matching approach only learns from the past DDoS data. Therefore, a reliable system has to watch what kind of attacks are carried out now and investigate how to prevent those attacks. Moreover, the amount of traffic flowing through the Internet increase rapidly and thus packet analysis should be done within considerable amount of time. This paper proposes a scalable, real-time traffic pattern analysis based on genetic algorithm to detect and prevent DDoS attacks on Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scalable DDoS protection system.","","","","10.1109/CEC.2015.7257075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7257075","DDoS attack;Genetic Algorithm;Hadoop","Accuracy;Computer crime;Distributed processing;Genetic algorithms;Genetics;IP networks;Sparks","computer network security;data handling;genetic algorithms;parallel processing;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack prevention;Hadoop cluster computing framework;Hadoop distributed processing infrastructure;Internet security;distributed denial-of-service attack protection system;genetic algorithms;scalable DDoS protection system;spoofing packets;traffic pattern analysis","","","","22","","","25-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important issue that has not been well studied so far is the selection of normal training data for network anomaly detection algorithm, which is highly related to the detection performance and computational complexity. Based on our previous proposed TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) anomaly detection method, which can detect anomalies with high detection rate and low false positive rate, we develop an instance selection mechanism for TCM-KNN based on EFCM (Extended Fuzzy C-Means) clustering algorithm in this paper, aiming at limiting the size of training dataset, thus reducing the computational cost of TCM-KNN and boosting its detection performance.

Owing to the special target market, several specific features of such systems are required including high accuracy, high performance, high concealment and ease of deployment. In this study, the authors proposed an infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system for indoor intrusion detection. This system, named BriGuard, shares a similar idea with radar. A 940 nm infrared light beam goes through an optical diffraction grating to generate light spot matrix imagery in the view of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor. The coordinates of the light spots are extracted and recorded. When someone enters the monitored area, the imaging plane changes and leads to a variation of the pre-recorded light spots coordinates. The light beam is modulated in order to be distinguished from the light in the environment. The lightweight algorithms require little computation power and data storage. BriGuard achieves a nearly zero false detection rate while covering a distance up to 10 m. It can process 30 full HD (1920 × 1080) frames per second. More importantly, because of unnoticeable infrared lights and very small form factor, the whole detection equipment is very hard to observe.","1751-8822","","","10.1049/iet-smt.2013.0171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089380","","","CMOS image sensors;diffraction gratings;infrared detectors;infrared imaging;optical modulation;security of data;video surveillance","BriGuard;complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensor;form factor;infrared light spot displacement-based surveillance system;light beam modulation;light spot matrix image generation;light spots coordinates extraction;lightweight algorithm;lightweight indoor intrusion detection system;optical diffraction grating;radar;wavelength 940 nm;zero false detection rate","","0","","","","","5 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSes) are one solution, however, these systems do not work effectively when the accesses are encrypted by protocols. Because the IDSes inspect the contents of a packet, it is difficult to find attacks by the current IDS. This paper presents a novel approach to anomaly detection for encrypted web accesses. This approach applies encrypted traffic analysis to intrusion detection, which analyzes contents of encrypted traffic using only data size and timing without decryption. First, the system extracts information from encrypted traffic, which is a set comprising data size and timing for each web client. Second, the accesses are distinguished based on similarity of the information and access frequencies are calculated. Finally, malicious activities are detected according to rules generated from the frequency of accesses and characteristics of HTTP traffic. The system does not extract private information or require enormous pre-operation beforehand, which are needed in conventional encrypted traffic analysis. We show that the system detects various attacks with a high degree of accuracy, adopting an actual dataset gathered at a gateway of a network and the DARPA dataset.","","978-0-7695-2847-2","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221118","","Cryptography;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Network servers;Protocols;Research and development;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Web server","Internet;cryptography","HTTP traffic;Web client;anomaly detection;encrypted Web accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;intrusion detection systems","","5","1","23","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
