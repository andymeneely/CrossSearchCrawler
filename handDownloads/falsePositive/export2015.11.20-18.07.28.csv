Four feature selection measures were used to reduce the number of features. We applied support vector machines on the resulting feature subsets. In addition, we used active learning as a selective sampling method to increase the performance of the classifier and improve its robustness in noisy data.

To ensure that a certain level of security is maintained in such environments, the system behavior has to be restrained by a security policy in order to regulate the nature and the context of actions that can be performed within the system, according to specific roles. In this paper, we propose a passive testing approach that permits to check whether a system respects its security policy. To reach this goal, we specify this policy using 'Nomad' formal language which is based on deontic and temporal logics. This language is well adapted to passive testing methods that aim to analyze collected system execution traces in order to give a verdict about their conformity with to the system security requirements.

Different features have different importance, which are often described by weights. So how to adaptively learning weights of different features is a very key issue in CBR, which impact directly the quality and performance of case extraction. Currently, in most practical CBR systems, the feature weights are given by domain experts subjectively. In this paper, we propose a PID operator-based feature weight learning method based on the fundamental theory of the control system. PID-based feature weighting method is a self-adaptive method, which utilizing the similar neural network architecture to construct the case base. Through designing 3 kinds of adjusting operators: Proportional, integral and derivative operator (PID), and each operator with different properties: reactive, prudent and sensitive, we can adjust the feature weight from different point of views, such as the current adjust results, the history results or the last two results. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the method, the experiment of network anomaly detection is conducted and the experimental results show that all 3 operators are effective which can converge the intrusion detection system into a stable state in relative small iterations.","","978-0-7695-3507-4","","10.1109/CSIE.2009.355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170599","Feature Weight Learning;Intrusion Detection;PID operators","Application software;Computer science;Control systems;Costs;History;Indexing;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Neural networks;Three-term control","adaptive control;case-based reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neurocontrollers;security of data;self-adjusting systems;stability;three-term control","CBR system;PID-based feature weight learning method;adaptively learning weight;case-based reasoning;domain expert;intrusion detection system;network anomaly detection;neural network architecture;proportional-integral-and-derivative operator;self-adaptive method;stable state","","0","","16","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The widely accepted existing routing protocols designed to accommodate the needs of such self-organised networks do not address possible threats aimed at the disruption of the protocol itself. The assumption of a trusted environment is not one that can be realistically expected; hence several efforts have been made towards the design of a secure routing protocol for ad hoc networks. The main problems with this approach are that it requires changes to the underlying routing protocol and that manual configuration of the initial security associations cannot be completely avoided. We propose RIDAN, a novel architecture that uses knowledge-based intrusion detection techniques to detect, in real-time, attacks that an adversary can perform against the routing fabric of a mobile ad hoc network. Our system is designed to take countermeasures minimising the effectiveness of an attack and maintaining the performance of the network within acceptable limits. RIDAN does not introduce any changes to the underlying routing protocol since it operates as an intermediate component between the network traffic and the utilised protocol with minimum processing overhead.

The built IDSs allow the detection of an acceptable proportion of variants of intrusion, beyond the already known intrusion forms. This last characteristic presents expressive advantages comparing to intrusion detection systems purely based on rules, because it dismisses the use of an extensive knowledge base and solves the false negative and false positive problems, through the fine adjustment of weights, given by the variation of the acceptation rate in the network output, when the network is trained.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-2065-0","978-1-4244-2066-7","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575234","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575234","","Artificial neural networks;Computer displays;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Packaging;Protection;Prototypes","computer networks;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;telecommunication security","IDS Snort;adaptive process;artificial neural network;intrusion detection;knowledge base;learning phase;network training","","0","","15","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It usually make use of software bugs to crash or freeze a service or network resource or bandwidth limits by making use of a flood attack to saturate all bandwidth. Predicting a potential DOS attacks would be very helpful for an IT departments or managements to optimize the security of intrusion detection system (IDS). Nowadays, false alarm rates and accuracy become the main subject to be addressed in measuring the effectiveness of IDS. Thus, the purpose of this work is to search the classifier that is capable to reduce the false alarm rates and increase the accuracy of the detection system. This study applied Artificial Immune System (AIS) in IDS. However, this study has been improved by using integration of rough set theory (RST) with Artificial Immune Recognition System 1 (AIRS1) algorithm, (Rough-AIRS1) to categorize the DoS samples. RST is expected to be able to reduce the redundant features from huge amount of data that is capable to increase the performance of the classification. Furthermore, AIS is an incremental learning approach that will minimize duplications of cases in a knowledge based. It will be efficient in terms of memory storage and searching for similarities in Intrusion Detection (IDS) attacks patterns. This study use NSL-KDD 20% train dataset to test the classifiers. Then, the performances are compared with single AIRS1 and J48 algorithm. Results from these experiments show that Rough-AIRS1 has lower number of false alarm rate compared to single AIRS but a little bit higher than J48.

It's difficult to detect out by conventional techniques as firewall or misuse-based intrusion detection. Anomaly detection has been considered as a promising approach for masquerade detection, which is based on the idea that significant departures from normal behavior could be considered due to a masquerade. However, for low detection accuracy and high false alarm rate, it is still in research stage. Till now, many methods have been proposed from different viewpoints, such as Hidden Markov Model, Naive Bayes, SVM, and so on. Compared with other methods that with well theoretical backgrounds, two intuitive determined statistical methods: the Customized Grammars method and the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness, reported the much better detection efficiency. Especially, both methods based on the intuitive notion that the more frequently a usage pattern was employed by current user previously, the more indicative of normal. In other hand, the statistics of usage pattern in the Customized Grammars method was based on sequential grammars, and that of the Self Signature approach combined with Uniqueness was on commands and 2-grams. In this paper, these two methods are compared and evaluated on two benchmark data sets of Unix command sequence: the Schonlau data and the Greenberg data. As a result, contributions of command frequency and command sequence grammar in IDS were analyzed and clarified.","","978-1-4244-3782-5","978-4-9904-2590-6","10.1109/SMCIA.2008.5045945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5045945","Command sequence;Customized grammar;Intrusion detection system (IDS);Masquerade detection;N-gram;Self signature;Uniqueness;Unix","Application software;Computer applications;Computer industry;Data security;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Statistical analysis;Statistics;Support vector machines","Unix;authorisation;grammars;statistical analysis","Greenberg data;IDS;Schonlau data;Unix command sequence;anomaly detection;command frequency;command sequence grammar;customized grammars;firewall;masquerade detection;misuse-based intrusion detection;self signature approach;statistical methods","","1","","18","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This act is called jamming and the malicious nodes are referred to as jammers. Jamming techniques vary from simple ones based on the continual transmission of interference signals, to more sophisticated attacks that aim at exploiting vulnerabilities of the particular protocol used. In this survey, we present a detailed up-to-date discussion on the jamming attacks recorded in the literature. We also describe various techniques proposed for detecting the presence of jammers.

The binary tree structure of a PT enables the model to divide the intrusion detection problem into sub-problems and solve them in decreased complexity in different tree levels. The expert neural networks (ENNs) embedded in the internal nodes can be simplified by limiting the number of inputs and hidden neurons. The potential advantage of a PT is that the trained learning model is actually a Â¿gray boxÂ¿ since each embedded simplified ENN can be interpreted into explicit rules easily. However, the whole structure of a PT is likely to be high complex, i.e., the trained PT is probably composed of a large number of internal nodes. In this case, the disjunctive description of the learned intrusion detection rules extracted from such PT is too complex to understand. The generalization ability of the detection approach may be depressed as well. In view of this situation, the structure of the trained PT needs to be fine pruned. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve competitive detection accuracy as well as refined learning model structure.","","978-1-4244-3835-8","978-0-7695-3816-7","10.1109/AICI.2009.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376342","decision tree;intrusion detection;perceptron tree;tree pruning","Artificial intelligence;Binary trees;Computational intelligence;Computer security;Decision trees;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","learning (artificial intelligence);perceptrons;security of data;trees (mathematics)","binary tree structure;expert neural networks;gray box;intrusion detection approach;perceptron tree learning model;refined learning model structure","","1","","16","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method uses promiscuous mode of working along with rating and collaborative decision making based on multiple threshold values. All nodes join the network with an initial value of 1 for an honesty rate index, termed as h-rate. The h-rate of a node dynamically increases or decreases depending on its behavior. A node is rewarded when it forwards packets for other nodes. It is penalized when it does some malicious act like dropping packets, etc. The h-rate for a node NX is recomputed based on its current h-rate, and the rewards or penalty points that it has accrued. The proposed rule-based scheme reduces the h-rate of a node gradually, if it behaves abnormally. This provides an inherent mechanism against phantom intrusion detection. The h-rate may also be used for secure routing in MANET.","","978-0-7695-3184-7","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557846","IDS;MANET;attacks;collaborative decision making;neighborhood watch;private key","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;security of data","MANET;collaborative decision making;collaborative intrusion detection system;honesty-rate;mobile ad-hoc networks;multiple threshold values;packet forwarding;phantom intrusion detection;rule-based scheme","","4","","15","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers and scientists are concerned on how to enhance the intrusion detection performance, to be able to deal with real-time attacks and detect them fast from quick response. One way to improve performance is to use minimal number of features to define a model in a way that it can be used to accurately discriminate normal from anomalous behaviour. Many feature selection techniques are out there to reduce feature sets or extract new features out of them. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detectors generation approach using genetic algorithm in conjunction with several features selection techniques, including principle components analysis, sequential floating, and correlation-based feature selection. A Genetic algorithm was applied with deterministic crowding niching technique, to generate a set of detectors from a single run. The results show that sequential-floating techniques with the genetic algorithm have the best results, compared to others tested, especially the sequential floating forward selection with detection accuracy 92.86% on the train set and 85.38% on the test set.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644096","Anomaly detectors generation;feature selection;genetic algorithms","Accuracy;Biological cells;Detectors;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data","anomaly detectors generation approach;correlation-based feature selection;deterministic crowding niching technique;feature selection techniques;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection systems;principle components analysis;real-time attacks;sequential-floating techniques","","2","","28","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article we run a simulation study of an attack causing an 86% decrease in packet delivery ratio and an increase in packet drops by the same proportion for a selected scenario. We simulated a wireless sensor network with the presence of phenomenon, to investigate and extended it to generate denial of service attacks. We have used the phenomenon contribution to generate a realistic traffic pattern for accurate evaluation of protocols, and compared it to the traditional method of using only Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic, usually employed by most researchers. We then adapted an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) into our simulated sensor network, and achieved detection rate of greater than 90% with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%. Each node was configured to independently monitor, detect and report intrusions, providing us with more accurate results and avoiding the additional delays and existence of a central point of failure that a centralised IDS would introduce. We also investigated the impact of a Black-hole attack on MANETS and we observed that under the on-demand routing protocol, the closer a malicious node is to the source of traffic, the greater the extent of damage inflicted on the networks.

This paper proposes a multiple level hybrid classifier for an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers which uses Enhanced C4.5 which rely on labeled training data and an Enhanced Fast Heuristic Clustering Algorithm for mixed data (EFHCAM). The main advantage of this approach is that the system can be trained with unlabelled data and is capable of detecting previously ""unseen"" attacks. Verification tests have been carried out by using the 1999 KDD Cup data set. From this work, it is observed that significant improvement has been achieved from the viewpoint of both high intrusion detection rate and reasonably low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4244-1924-1","978-1-4244-1924-1","10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447164","","Classification tree analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Data security;Heuristic algorithms;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Training data","","","","2","","11","","","4-6 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on networks that use a new service paradigm as a nested DiffServ model, which has been described as service vectors in combination with the explicit end-point admission control (EEAC) scheme [1]. The main objectives of service vectors are to improve the QoS granularity and service routing flexibility. These improvements enhances both network utilization and user benefits. However, QoS routing schemes need to consider service vectors to achieve such improvements. In this paper, we discuss a new set of requirements that are added into QoS routing schemes to avoid false routing and low network utilization when using service vectors. The OSPF protocol, as the widely used protocol, guarantees feasible deployability of service vectors in existing networks. Furthermore, we introduce a network architecture that integrates security into the set of QoS parameters and show how security-enabled QoS (SQoS) can also use the OSPF protocol for SQoS routing.","","978-1-4244-0002-7","978-1-4244-0003-4","10.1109/SARNOF.2006.4534791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534791","Network Security;OSPF;Quality of Service;Service Vector;k Shortest Paths","Admission control;Algorithm design and analysis;Computer security;Cost function;Data communication;Diffserv networks;National security;Routing;State feedback","","","","2","1","8","","","27-28 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considerable research related to portscan detection has been done and many algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the network intrusion detection system (NIDS). In order to distinguish portscanners from remote hosts, most portscan detection algorithms use a fixed threshold that is manually managed by the network manager. Because the threshold is a constant, even though the network environment or the characteristics of traffic can change, many false positives and false negatives are generated by NIDS. This reduces the efficiency of NIDS and imposes a high processing burden on a network management system (NMS). In this paper, in order to address this problem, we propose an automatic portscan detection system using an fast increase slow decrease (FISD) scheme, that will automatically and adaptively set the threshold based on statistical data for traffic during prior time periods. In particular, we focus on reducing false positives rather than false negatives, while the threshold is adaptively set within a range between minimum and maximum values. We also propose a new portscan detection algorithm, rate of increase in the number of failed connection request (RINF), which is much more suitable for our system and shows better performance than other existing algorithms. In terms of the implementation, we compare our scheme with other two simple threshold estimation methods for an adaptive threshold setting scheme. Also, we compare our detection algorithm with other three existing approaches for portscan detection using a real traffic trace. In summary, we show that FISD results in less false positives than other schemes and RINF can fast and accurately detect portscanners. We also show that the proposed system, including our scheme and algorithm, provides good performance in terms of the rate of false positi- es.","1229-2370","","","10.1109/JCN.2010.6388436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388436","Adaptive threshold setting;automatic portscan detection;false negative;false positive","Adaptive systems;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Feature extraction;Heating;IP networks;Real-time systems","","","","1","","19","","","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The second, called an attack invariant, describes semantic properties that hold in any instance of the attack. For example, an invariant may state that a given FTP attack must include a successful FTP login and can be launched only after the FTP representation mode has been set to ASCII. We iteratively eliminate false positives and negatives from an initial session signature by comparing the signature language to the language of the invariant.

Test result shows that the proposed approach works well in detecting different attacks accurately with less false positive and negative rate and it is comparable to those reported in the literature.","","978-1-4244-6591-0","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2010.5592568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5592568","Back Propagation Algorithm;Feed Forward Neural Network;Intrusion Detection;KDD Cup'99 data","Artificial neural networks;Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Probes;Testing;Training","backpropagation;computer network security;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence)","artificial neural network;backpropagation algorithm;feed forward neural network;intrusion detection;machine learning;network based computer systems;profile data set","","0","","16","","","29-31 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A weight hamming distance method is used in detection, which is simple and correct in finding anomalous behavior. A well-trained ANNIDS can monitor the network in real time. The experimental results show that ANNIDS performs best when vigilance parameter is 0.4 to 0.5 and intrusion threshold is 0.4.

Existing IDPSs do not seem to provide a satisfactory method of achieving these two conflicting goals. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) fulfill the network performance requirement but exhibit poor protection under successive attacks. On the other hand, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) can protect the network by dropping the malicious packets that match any attacking pattern; however, this can have a negative impact on network performance in terms of delay as the attacking patterns increase. This results in a tradeoff between security enforcement levels on one hand and the performance and usability of an enterprise information system on the other. This paper aims to study the impact of security enforcement levels on the performance and usability of an enterprise information system. We propose a rule mode selection optimization technique that aims to determine an appropriate IDPS configuration set in order to maximize the security enforcement levels while avoiding any unnecessary network performance degradation. Simulation was conducted to validate our proposed technique.

Modern intrusion detection applications face complex requirements - they need to be reliable, extensible, easy to manage, and have low maintenance cost. In recent years, data mining-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have demonstrated high accuracy, good generalization to novel types of intrusion, and robust behavior in a changing environment. Still, significant challenges exist in the design and implementation of production quality IDSs. Instrumenting components such as data transformations, model deployment, and cooperative distributed detection remain a labor intensive and complex engineering endeavor. This paper describes DAID, a database-centric architecture that leverages data mining within the Oracle RDBMS to address these challenges. DAID also offers numerous advantages in terms of scheduling capabilities, alert infrastructure, data analysis tools, security, scalability, and reliability.

In addition, they can be implemented as a black box solution that sits away from the host using methods that allow rapid processing of the incoming packets without the need to examine high layer information such as protocol details or host profiles. However, the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic can shift. These changes, caused by various site-level phenomenon (such as changes in overall activity at the networked site or even system updates), can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates. In turn, this effect puts a heavy burden on the post-detection stages which inspect the packets that have raised alarms thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to guarantee the level of reliability such a system is expected to provide, we need an autonomous mechanism for detecting when a valid traffic change occurs and a self-tuning mechanism when such an alarm is raised. In this paper, we explore in detail the first step towards automating the tuning of intrusion detection systems-the alarm generation. We present a scheme for computing when a traffic change occurs using statistical analysis with anomaly score data. This method can be adapted to a variety of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. We show that, with some modification, a combination of technical analysis methods (typically used in predicting and verifying financial market data) can be used to guide the intrusion detection system by providing information on when the traffic change occurs. We also discuss the possibility of quick re-tuning using incoming packets collected on-line with a noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme.","1097-2641","978-1-4244-9330-2","","10.1109/PCCC.2010.5682339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682339","anomaly detection;concept drift;intrusion detection;network security","Correlation;Intrusion detection;Linear regression;Prediction algorithms;Training data","security of data;statistical analysis","alarm generation;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;black box solution;dynamic self-tuning;never-seen attacks;noise-resistant intrusion detection scheme;site-level phenomenon;statistical analysis;statistical fingerprint;technical analysis methods;traffic change","","0","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though it is not computationally feasible for every circumstance, it is elastic enough for the usual use case. Paper [8] proposes an interesting approach based on attack graphs. An attack graph is a graph that represents all possible sequences of the attacker's actions that lead him/her to the established goals. These action sequences are also called attack traces. The main disadvantage of this approach is its high computational complexity. Thus, attack modeling needs to represent not only the sequences of actions, but also the attack impact, as well as how countermeasures can mitigate this impact and at which cost. However, the human body, based on the immune system, calculates risk every second for offering the correct manner of immune response to foreign threats, without hampering normal cell operation. Why don't we use this behavior in cyber defense systems? Applying Matzinger's danger theory, with the key concept of a distress signal, involved in risk assessment seems to be the logical decision, due to its lite resource consumption and categorical nature, which rapidly defines an attack surface, when correlating information gathered from local agents dispersed on protected hosts. As a proof of concept in favor of supporting this idea, a feed-forward backward-propagating neural network was setup to correlate threat data from agents installed on remote protected hosts. This intelligent system assesses the risk of a cyber-attack taking place and bringing the defense systems to an alarmed state in a timely manner, which can help offer a quick response against an attacker.","","","","10.1109/ICComm.2014.6866746","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866746","attack vector;cyber security;danger theory;early warning systems;neural networks;risk assessment","Alarm systems;Artificial intelligence;Immune system;Internet;Neural networks;Risk management","computational complexity;computer network security;feedforward;graph theory;neural nets;risk management","Matzinger danger theory;attack graph;attack surface;attack traces;biologically inspired risk assessment;computational complexity;cyber security;feedforward backward-propagating neural network;immune response;immune system;intelligent system;threat data","","2","","10","","","29-31 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the early stage of an attack, however, these changes are hard to detect and difficult to distinguish from usual traffic fluctuations. Rapid response, a minimal false-alarm rate, and the capability to detect a wide spectrum of attacks are the crucial features of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we develop efficient adaptive sequential and batch-sequential methods for an early detection of attacks that lead to changes in network traffic, such as denial-of-service attacks, worm-based attacks, port-scanning, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These methods employ a statistical analysis of data from multiple layers of the network protocol to detect very subtle traffic changes. The algorithms are based on change-point detection theory and utilize a thresholding of test statistics to achieve a fixed rate of false alarms while allowing us to detect changes in statistical models as soon as possible. There are three attractive features of the proposed approach. First, the developed algorithms are self-learning, which enables them to adapt to various network loads and usage patterns. Secondly, they allow for the detection of attacks with a small average delay for a given false-alarm rate. Thirdly, they are computationally simple and thus can be implemented online. Theoretical frameworks for detection procedures are presented.

The dynamic topology of MANET allows nodes to join and leave the network at any point of time. Wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation and constrained capability. In Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET), network traffics are redirected to a specific node or from the malicious node causing serious damage. And also it causes false identification of a good node as a bad one. This increases false alarms and as a result any further communication with that node or via that node is halted. It occurs due to lack of authentication and it grants provision for any node to corrupt other node's legitimate information. In this paper we compare and analysis the performance of various attacks with proposed attacks on different routing protocol in mobile ad hoc networks. Various types of scenarios are generated and each of the attacks is simulated on each of these, then their parameters like throughput, packet delivery ratio and delay will be compared The performance differentials are analyzed using varying pause time, constant nodes and dynamic topology.

Therefore, we need strong mechanism to detect these malevolent nodes and to classify normal and abnormal nodes as per the behavior of nodes. Machine learning techniques distinguish outlier nodes quickly and accurately provide classification by observing behavior of those nodes in the network. In this paper, we study various machine learning techniques as artificial neural network, support vector machine, decision tree, Q-learning, Bayesian network for identifying the malicious nodes. These techniques are able to detect black hole, gray hole, flooding attacks and other packet dropping attacks. These types of misbehaving nodes are identified and future behaviors of the nodes are predicted with supervised, un-supervised, reinforcement machine learning techniques.","","","","10.1109/SPACES.2015.7058308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058308","Mobile ad hoc network;black hole;gray hol;machine learning techniques;packet dropping attacks;support vector machine (SVM)","Bayes methods;Genetic algorithms;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Support vector machines","belief networks;computer network security;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines","Bayesian network;Q-learning;artificial neural network;black hole detection;decision tree;flooding attack detection;gray hole detection;malevolent node detection;malicious node detection;mobile ad hoc network classification;packet dropping attack node detection;reinforcement machine learning technique;supervised learning;support vector machine;unsupervised learning","","0","","38","","","2-3 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the existing approaches either are rigid, inflexible designs tailored to a specific situation or require manual setting of design parameters such as the initial number of clusters. In this paper we allow the design parameters to be determined dynamically by adopting a layered hybrid architecture, hence resolving the aforementioned shortcomings. The first layer uses FCM and GK fuzzy clustering to extract the features and the second layer uses a set of RBF neural networks to perform the classification. The flexible design parameters are initial number of clusters, number of RBF networks and number of neurons inside each network which are determined with minimal input from the user. The simulation result shows high detection rates as well as fewer false positives compared to earlier approaches.","","978-1-4577-0040-8","978-0-7695-4393-2","10.1109/CNSR.2011.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771201","computational intelligence;fuzzy clustering evaluation;radial basis function;software architecture","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Neurons;Principal component analysis;Radial basis function networks;Training","computer network security;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;radial basis function networks","FCM fuzzy clustering;GK fuzzy clustering;RBF neural networks;adaptive hybrid architecture;automatic detection;design parameters;intrusion detection;layered hybrid architecture;network intrusion","","1","","21","","","2-5 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed framework, there are two modules, the data preprocessing module and the classifier module. Data preprocessing module is the process of preparing and adjusting the raw data in order to feed into the classification algorithms. Multiple classifiers are used depending on the number of the attack types, in the classifier module. Additionally, the Boolean weighted score method is applied to each classifier to improve performance and accuracy. The weighted score is assigned to an instance and content from the dataset by computing a linear combination of attribute scores where each attribute contributes a Boolean value. Then, it is combined with the probability of an attack of attribute learning by the training model. This score will then be used to evaluate whether it is attack or not. The study was based on available network traffic datasets (KDD'99 dataset and WiSNet dataset). According to the experimental results, using the multi-classifiers and the Boolean weighted scoring can better detect the attack instances than the single classifier does.","","978-1-4673-1937-9","","10.1109/ICCISci.2012.6297119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6297119","Classification algorithm;Intrusion Detection;Scoring and Weighting","Computational modeling;Computers;Data preprocessing;Intrusion detection;Probes;Telecommunication traffic;Training","Boolean algebra;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","Boolean value;Boolean weighted score method;KDD99 dataset;WiSNet dataset;attack detection;attack type;attribute learning;attribute scores;classification algorithm;classifier module;data preprocessing module;multiple classifiers;network traffic dataset;probability;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection system;training model","","0","","32","","","12-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this work is to provide a systematic virus detection hardware solution for network security for embedded systems. Instead of placing entire matching patterns on a chip, our solution is a two-phase dictionary-based antivirus processor that works by condensing as much of the important filtering information as possible onto a chip and infrequently accessing off-chip data to make the matching mechanism scalable to large pattern sets. In the first stage, the filtering engine can filter out more than 93.1% of data as safe, using a merged shift table. Only 6.9% or less of potentially unsafe data must be precisely checked in the second stage by the exact-matching engine from off-chip memory.

In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that are protocol-compliant, non-intrusive, and utilize legitimate application-layer requests to overwhelm system resources. We characterize application-layer resource attacks as either request flooding, asymmetric, or repeated one-shot, on the basis of the application workload parameters that they exploit. To protect servers from these attacks, we propose a counter-mechanism namely DDoS Shield that consists of a suspicion assignment mechanism and a DDoS-resilient scheduler. In contrast to prior work, our suspicion mechanism assigns a continuous value as opposed to a binary measure to each client session, and the scheduler utilizes these values to determine if and when to schedule a session's requests. Using testbed experiments on a web application, we demonstrate the potency of these resource attacks and evaluate the efficacy of our counter-mechanism. For instance, we mount an asymmetric attack which overwhelms the server resources, increasing the response time of legitimate clients from 0.3 seconds to 40 seconds.

The SN-IDS utilizes social relations as metrics-of-interest for anomaly detections, which is different from most traditional IDS approaches. To construct proper social networks, we first investigate ad hoc MAC and network layer data attributes and select relevant social feature sets; then we build up a set of socio-matrices based on these features. Social analysis methods are applied to these matrices to detect suspicious behaviors of mobile nodes. NS-2 simulation results show that this SN-IDS system can effectively detect common attacks with high detection rates and low false positive alarm rates. Furthermore, it has clear advantages over the conventional association rule based data mining IDS in terms of computation and system complexity.","","978-1-4244-2308-8","978-1-4244-2309-5","10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784728","","Ad hoc networks;Association rules;Computational modeling;Data mining;Data security;Electronic mail;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Routing;Social network services","ad hoc networks;computer networks;security of data;social sciences","MAC layer;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection system;network layer;social network analysis;socio-matrix","","1","","9","","","10-13 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper includes an overview of several IDS implementations. Many approaches based on hidden Markov models and various forms of finite state automata have been proposed to solve problem of detecting anomaly intrusion, a security attack in which an intruder assumes the identity of a legitimate user. It is proposed to give a general framework for IDS based on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics and agent technology. Our approach is focused on the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. To achieve low false positive rate in this framework the intrusion can be detected by means of comparing the signature of the current user's session with already existing signatures of the potential intruder. The algorithms of computational biology such as approximation algorithm and Carillo-Lippman heuristic algorithm and sum-of-pairs scoring function are used to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder, the user signature and past intruder's signatures. Finally in this research work computational bioinformatics techniques and agent technology are used to offer security in host and network to yield a promising combination of intrusion detection rate and false positive rate","","1-4244-0369-3","1-4244-0370-7","10.1109/INDCON.2006.302764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086235","Agents;Intrusion detection;anomaly intrusion;misuse intrusion","Approximation algorithms;Automata;Bioinformatics;Biology computing;Computational biology;Heuristic algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sequences","biology computing;computer networks;digital signatures;finite state machines;hidden Markov models;software agents","Carillo-Lippman heuristic algorithm;IDS;agent based intrusion detection system;anomaly intrusion;approximation algorithm;computational bioinformatics;computational biology;finite state automata;hidden Markov models;host security;multiple sequence alignment;network security;pair-wise sequence alignment;sum-of-pairs scoring function;user signature","","0","","21","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Anomaly detection is a pattern recognition task whose goal is to report the occurrence of abnormal or unknown behavior in a given system being monitored. This paper presents a dynamic anomaly detection scheme that can effectively identify a group of especially harmful internal attackers - masqueraders in cellular mobile networks. Our scheme uses the trace data of wireless application layer by a user as feature value. Based on this, the use pattern of a mobile's user can be captured by rough sets, and the abnormal behavior of the mobile can be also detected effectively by applying a roughness membership function with both the age of the user profile and weighted feature values.

The purpose of this research is to construct a holistic solution that is able to firstly reduce the number of alerts to be processed and at the same time produce a high quality attack scenarios that are meaningful to the administrators in a timely manner. To achieve these goals, alerts generated by IDS sensors need to be correlated and organized in an appropriate approach. Thus the significant contribution of this research is to create an integrated operational framework for alert processing that reduces the amount of alerts to be processed and creates more meaningful attack scenarios to be analyzed.

Most of the systems are designed without cyber security in mind, since interconnection with other systems through unsafe channels, is becoming the rule during last years. The de-isolation of SCADA systems make them vulnerable to attacks, disrupting its correct functioning and tampering with its normal operation. In this paper we present a intrusion detection module capable of detecting malicious network traffic in a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, based on the combination of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with RBF kernel and recursive k-means clustering. The combination of OCSVM with recursive k-means clustering leads the proposed intrusion detection module to distinguish real alarms from possible attacks regardless of the values of parameters σ and ν, making it ideal for real-time intrusion detection mechanisms for SCADA systems. The OCSVM module developed is trained by network traces off line and detect anomalies in the system real time. The module is part of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) system developed under CockpitCI project.","","","","10.1109/QSHINE.2014.6928673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928673","","Data models;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;SCADA systems;Training","SCADA systems;radial basis function networks;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","CockpitCI project;K-means recursive clustering;OCSVM model;RBF kernel;SCADA systems;intrusion detection;malicious network traffic;one-class support vector machine;recursive k-means clustering;supervisory control and data acquisition systems;unsafe channels","","0","","6","","","18-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main reason for using data mining techniques for intrusion detection systems is due to the enormous volume of existing and newly appearing network data that require processing.

Conventional GNP-based rule mining focused on binary-valued transaction data. Therefore, Fuzzy GNP based class association rule mining has been proposed to deal with the continuous-valued data types in the real network connection data. In this paper, firstly, many interesting rules are extracted by Fuzzy GNP-based hybrid class association rule mining from training data. Then, a post-processing method is used to prune class association rules. After that, a classifier is modeled based on the multi-dimensional probability distribution for testing data.
