In this paper, we analyze the possibility of using data stream mining for enhancing the security of AMI through an intrusion detection system (IDS), which is a second line of defense after the primary security methods of encryption, authentication, authorization, etc. We propose a realistic and reliable IDS architecture for the whole AMI system, which consists of individual IDSs for three different levels of AMI's components: smart meter, data concentrator, and AMI headend. We also explore the performances of various existing state-of-the-art data stream mining algorithms on a publicly available IDS data set, namely, the KDD Cup 1999 data set. Then, we conduct a feasibility analysis of using these existing data stream mining algorithms, which exhibit varying levels of accuracies, memory requirements, and running times, for the distinct IDSs at AMI's three different components.

The actions of sensor nodes are either pre-scheduled inside chips or triggered to respond outside events in the predefined way. This relatively predictable working flow make it easy to build accurate node profiles and detect any violation of normal profiles. In this paper, traffic patterns observed are used to model node behavior in wireless sensor networks. Firstly, selected traffic related features are used to translate observed packets into different events. Following this, unique patterns based on the arriving order of different packet events are extracted to form the normal profile for each sensor node during the profile learning stage. Finally, real time anomaly detection can be achieved based on the profile matching.","","978-0-7695-2847-2","","10.1109/AINAW.2007.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221100","","Humans;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Runtime;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","anomaly node behavior detection;profile matching;traffic patterns;wireless sensor networks","","1","","14","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To study these attacks, the honeypot must capture and log large amounts of data which are very difficult to process manually. So, the analysis of these logs has become a very difficult and time consuming task. To resolve this problem, several researchers have proposed the use of data mining techniques in order to classify logged traffic and extract useful information. In this paper, we present a data analysis tool for our Honeypot Router. This tool is based on data mining clustering. The main idea is to extract useful features from data captured by the Honeypot Router. These data will be then clustered by using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm in order to classify the captured packets and extract those that are suspicious. Suspicious packets will be then verified by a human expert.

In this paper, we have identified the limitations of the current techniques and propose a model for alert correlation that overcomes the shortcomings. An improved ""require/provide"" model is presented which established a cooperation between statistical and knowledge-based model, to achieve higher detection rate with the minimal false positives. A knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional conditions provide manageable and meaningful attack graphs. The proposed model has been implemented in real-time and has successfully generated security events on establishing a correlation between attack signatures. The system has been evaluated to detect one of the most serious multi-stage attacks in cyber crime -- SQLIA (SQL Injection Attack). Typical SQLIA steps are analyzed within the realm of simulated malicious activities normally used by cyber criminals. The system has efficiently established a correlation in attack behaviors and has generated an attack map. The map can be used to discretely analyze the correlated attack activities which in other case may go undetected thus facilitating the multi-stage attack recognition process.","1550-445X","978-1-61284-313-1","978-0-7695-4337-6","10.1109/AINA.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763386","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;SQL Injection;multi-stage attac","Correlation;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Mars;Probabilistic logic;Real time systems;Security","SQL;security of data;statistical analysis","SQL injection attack;SQLI activities;attack signatures;cyber crime;event based alert correlation system;knowledge based model;rule based mechanisms;statistical modeling","","0","","24","","","22-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection scheme based on a learning process, so that the training data can be updated at particular time intervals.

This sensor evolved from the technology of ldquoGUIDARrdquo pioneered in the 1970's to bring intrusion location to perimeter sensors. OmniTrax theory of operation, based on a unique application of new Ultra Wideband Radar was described, as well as its feature of allowing pinpoint location of intrusions along 800m of sensor cable using a single processor. This feature is fundamentally important to direct the response force, and also for rapid debug and maintenance of the installation. Since that first presentation the sensor has been fully realized as one of the most cost-effective ranging perimeter sensors with its own integrated power and communications network. It has also been evaluated for both detection and environmental performance at our own local test site (SITE), and at independent government sensor test agencies. Further components of the technology have been developed to enlarge the range of site applications. This paper provides an update on the technology and its application including some new applications for leaky coaxial cable technology.

"Distributed monitoring of conditional entropy for anomaly detection in streams","Arackaparambil, C.; Bratus, S.; Brody, J.; Shubina, A.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Dartmouth Coll., Hanover, NH, USA","Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum (IPDPSW), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on","20100524","2010","","","1","8","In this work we consider the problem of monitoring information streams for anomalies in a scalable and efficient manner. We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges.

Firewall along is not able to protect the system from being attacked through normal service channel. Furthermore, most of the current intrusion detection system focuses on the border of organization network. If the attack comes from inside, this setup does not provide any protection to hosts in the local network and the network itself. Therefore, we need to use other mechanism to protect the critical system as well as the network itself.

To solve this problem, a technique called frequent episode rules (FERs) base on data mining has been introduced into anomaly detection system (ADS). These episode rules are used to distinguish anomalous sequences of TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections from normal traffic episodes. Unfortunately, this technique is so depend on the machine learning that we may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal traffic data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for Internet anomaly detection with weighted fuzzy matching over frequent episode rules. We use weighted fuzzy matching algorithm to match the rules, though machine learning may not cover all the normal traffic.

This paper describes an approach for simultaneously examining multiple network and host abstraction layers to discover anomalous behavior and then correlating anomalies to determine whether an attack is taking place and, when applicable, select an automatic response.

Security of these assets is a day-to-day job placing a tremendous cognitive load on information-technology (IT) professionals, which can make it almost impossible to manage the security aspects of KMS. Autonomic-computing systems are well suited to manage KMS, as they use high-level system objectives provided by administrators as the basis for managing the security of KMS. The authors model the self-protection and self-healing configuration attributes in autonomic systems through game-theoretic models. The proposed modeling approach progressively moves from a manual intervention-oriented security setup to an autonomic security setup. This allows the authors to compare and contrast the different approaches and provide insights on their applicability to different security environments. The authors find that moving to a partial autonomic system with self-healing mechanisms can provide a stable environment for securing enterprise knowledge assets and can reduce hacking. It is beneficial to implement an autonomic system when manual investigation costs are higher and/or when the volume of malicious traffic is very low. An autonomic approach is especially attractive when it is difficult to impose penalties on malicious users.

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","2","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique.

After formulating the cooperation between basic detectors as a partially observable Markov decision process, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to search in an optimal cooperation manner, with the objective to achieve broader detection coverage and fewer false alerts. Furthermore, the coordinator's behavior can be adjusted easily by setting a reward signal to meet the diverse demands of changing system situations.

Rough set can reduce dimensions of attributes and filter some invasion behaviors which are esay to identify. Secondly, less attributes selected by RS are input FSVM to train and classify, this method can improve operational speed of FSVM. For this model, FSVM uses an effective Fuzzy Membership Function based on the affinity among sample points to select an appropriate fuzzy membership to reduce the effects of outliers.

Our approach is composed of 2 layers: the lower layer consists of both host and network based sensors, which are specifically designed to collect local features and make local decisions to differentiate those easy-to-detect attacks; the upper layer is a fusion control center, it makes global decisions on those locally uncertain events by adopting Dempster's combination rule.

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding). In our proposed system, any intrusion activity will cause significant variations, thereby causing a large error, while a minor aberration in the variations (concept drift) w- ll not be immediately reported as alert.","","978-1-4577-1375-0","","10.1109/THS.2011.6107850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107850","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems;Concept Drift;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Engines;Entropy;Feedback control;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Kullback-Leibler divergence;ROC curve;adapting ROC thresholding;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;concept drift detection;concept-drifting data stream mining;control theoretic model;entropy measurement scheme;feedback control engine;incremental anomaly based detection;network attack;normal traffic pattern profile;receiver operating characteristic curve;supervised machine learning;support vector machine based classifier;user activity","","1","","21","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms.

Despite all the effort in this area, the design of IPSs remains a difficult, ad hoc process. In this paper, we propose the LAIDS/LIDS framework for systematic design of IPS. A major advantage of our framework is that IPSs designed in this framework have a very simple countermeasure-generation process. To better illustrate our idea, we have implemented a prototype IPS, the Lazy Shepherding IPS, based on our framework. Evaluation shows that the prototype is effective against all tested attacks, and incurs an overhead of less than 3% when it is configured to defend against a large number of attacks.

An IDS triggers thousands of alerts per day which is difficult for human users to analyze them and take appropriate actions. It is important to reduce the false alarm alerts, intelligently integrate and correlate them in order to present a high level view of the detected security issue to the administrator.

Usually some nodes act maliciously and they are able to do different kinds of DoS attacks. In order to make the network more secure, malicious nodes should be isolated from the network. In this paper, we model the interaction of nodes in WSN and intrusion detection system (IDS) as a Bayesian game formulation and use this idea to make a secure routing protocol. By this approach nodes are motivated to act normally and gain reputation, and IDS can perform better by using the history of the game.

To be able to react to different network attacks in changing environments, a generic and flexible detection system is of paramount importance. This paper presents a method that uses statistical features as the input to a rule learning technique. First, for extracting suitable features for intrusion detection, an entropy and volume- based approach is introduced. Then, for the classification task, a genetic-based rule learning technique that utilises an interval-based representation for statistical features of network traffic is proposed. Two sources of data are used to evaluate this technique and to compare against other machine learning techniques. The results show that our proposed approach provides simple rulesets with competitive detection performance in comparison to other algorithms.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7292933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7292933","","Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Ports (Computers)","computer crime;computer network security;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet;classification task;entropy;features extraction;genetic-based rule learning technique;interval-based representation;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;network attacks;network intrusion detection;network traffic;prevention schemes;reliable computer networks;secure computer networks;security breaches monitoring;security mechanism;statistical features;statistical rule learning approach;volume-based approach","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, an experimental test bed was created to capture a diversity of traffic, which includes flows of a widely used P2P media streaming application called Goal Bit. The collected traces of traffic were then analysed, and a set of rules was created for the SNORT network intrusion detection system, which allows the successful detection of the encrypted traffic generated by Goal Bit. The accuracy of this system was then validated experimentally.","","978-1-4577-1052-0","978-0-7695-4489-2","10.1109/NCA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6038606","Deep Packet Inspection;Encrypted Traffic;Goalbit;Media Streaming;P2P;Peer-to-Peer;Traffic Classification","Encryption;IP networks;Media;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Streaming media","cryptography;media streaming;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","GoalBit;P2P network;SNORT network intrusion detection system;encrypted traffic;mesh-based peer-to-peer live streaming;multimedia content streaming;online detection;traffic shaping mechanisms","","0","","29","","","25-27 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, sophisticated cases of computer attacks often render attempts to isolate failed attacks from successful attacks ineffective. Thus, attacks are erroneous interpreted and most successful cases of computer attacks are not forestalled while in progress despite the huge volume of warnings that intrusion detectors generate beforehand.

As a first step to launching attacks, attackers scan production networks looking for open services and vulnerable software. These scanning or enumeration activities, if monitored properly, can be used as early warning systems against a much sophisticated and dedicated attack. Honey nets are deployed for the purpose of tracking malicious activities and learn about hackers' origin, methods and attacks. However, today's Honey nets produce an enormous amount of data which becomes a challenge to analyze. In this paper, we attempt to separate and identify scanning traffic from other types of traffic. To accomplish this, we have developed a tool that utilizes known data mining techniques to find the scanning activities in Honey net data, which is an aggregate traffic data collected by multiple Honey pots. Being able to identify scanning activities will allow security analysts to focus more on other types of traffic, and hence be able to study and analyze other types of attacks.","","978-1-4577-0975-3","978-0-7695-4482-3","10.1109/CICSyN.2011.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005682","Data Mining;Honeynet;Intrusion Detection;Scanning","Data mining;Feature extraction;IP networks;Machine learning;Probes;Servers;Time series analysis","alarm systems;computerised monitoring;data mining;security of data","Honey pots;Honeynet data;aggregate traffic data;business;data mining;early warning system;enumeration activity;financial benefits;hacker origin;malicious activity tracking;open services;production network scanning activity;security analysts;unauthorized access;vulnerable software","","0","","23","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By employing efficient representations for the transition rules in each DFA, TDP-DFA significantly reduces the complexity.

Both commercial and noncommercial solutions, called IDS (intrusion detection system), usually maintain their own proprietary databases by collecting detection patterns. In general, more patterns collected and more up-to-date of the databases surely increase the capabilities of their bundled IDS solutions. However, due to the coverage limitation and late awareness, there still have new growing uncovered breaches that single IDS would not be able to catch up. The reasons are two: 1) Any one proprietary IDS is incapable of collecting so many detection patterns daily brought up in Internet world. 2) Systems under certain proprietary IDS's protection are unable to get instant notification of new detection patterns, most of which are discovered by other IDSs.

In this paper a Hierarchical Secure Virtualization Model (HSVM) is proposed to provide threat quarantine and conquer in addition to complete control on virtualization. HSVM needs to be implemented under the virtualization level and eventually moving up to the guest OS. This security model has the potential to protect various cloud service models implemented by cloud vendors, such as IaaS, PaaS, dSaaS, and SaaS, and improves cloud vendor control level in IaaS.

A variety of classical machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms has been applied to intrusion detection with varying levels of success. We make two observations about intrusion detection. One is that intrusion detection is significantly more effective by using multiple sources of information in an intelligent way, which is precisely what human experts rely on. Second, different errors in intrusion detection have different costs associated with them-a simplified example being that a false alarm may be more expensive than a misdetection and, hence, the true objective function to be minimized is the cost of errors and not the error rate itself.

Such networks may be self operating or linked to a larger internet and may have one or multiple different transceivers between nodes resulting in a highly dynamic and autonomous topology. The first focus is on MANET attacks followed by detection of the malicious node from MANET via Polynomial-Reduction Algorithm. Although scientists have assessed many algorithms for the detection and rectification of the malicious nodes in the MANETs, the problem still persists. Due to the unprecedented growth in technology, the unidentified vulnerabilities are also intensifying. Therefore, it is very crucial to come up with some ground-breaking ideas to prevent the MANET.

One detection approach uses data collected by the runtime sensors to construct a convex-hull geometric object whose interior represents the normal execution of the monitored application. The approach detects faults by classifying the current application state as being either inside or outside of the convex hull. However, due to the computational complexity of creating a convex hull in multi-dimensional space, the convex-hull approach is limited to a few metrics. Therefore, not all sensors can be used to detect faults and so some must be dropped or combined with others. This paper compares the effectiveness of genetic-programming, genetic-algorithm, and random-search approaches in solving the problem of selecting sensors and combining them into metrics. These techniques are used to find 8 metrics that are derived from a set of 21 available sensors. The metrics are used to detect faults during the execution of a Java-based HTTP web server. The results of the search techniques are compared to two hand-crafted solutions specified by experts.","","978-1-4244-8341-9","","10.1109/SSBSE.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635154","autonomic computing;genetic algorithms;genetic programming;search based software engineering","Biological cells;Libraries;Monitoring;Phase measurement;Sensors;Software","fault tolerant computing;genetic algorithms;search problems","autonomic system;convex-hull geometric object;fault detection;genetic-algorithm;genetic-programming;multidimensional space;random-search approach;search method;software sensor","","2","","25","","","7-9 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, multi-core solutions for layer 7 protocol identification achieve 2 Gbps or higher processing speed. However, they occupy most of the processing cores in the system, leaving limited headroom for more complex manipulations, such as intrusion detection/prevention, anti-malware, data loss prevention, etc. Based on the deep understanding of the application bottlenecks and the optimization techniques of X86-64 platforms, we achieve the same or higher speed using only one core, saving more resources for further processing. In this paper, we make a deep system-wide profile and analyze the major hotspots of a typical network system on an Intel X86-64 platform, including a complete TCP/IP stack and a protocol identification engine by deep packet inspection (DPI). Profiling results and analysis show that network applications containing layer 2 to layer 7 processing are inherently memory and computation intensive. Then we propose optimization guidelines and techniques: 1) removing memory bottlenecks: combining independent irregular memory access to hide delay, using software-assistant cache prefetch to improve cache hit ratio, and mapping memory from kernel space to user space to reduce access overhead; 2) removing computation bottlenecks: using 64-bit registers and instructions to speed up the common computations, and using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instructions to accelerate special time-consuming tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art multi-core implementations, our implementation on the X86-64 platform using only one core can deliver the same or higher processing speed of 7 Gbps with the average packet size of 501 bytes and 2 Gbps with the average packet size of 110 bytes.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-7754-8","","10.1109/ISCC.2010.5546496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5546496","","Clocks;Delay;Kernel;Magnetic cores;Optimization;Pattern matching;Protocols","","","","1","","24","","","22-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","","978-1-4673-2433-5","","10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6708514","","Accuracy;Base stations;Correlation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Support vector machines;Vectors","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor placement;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","base station;data classification;decision making process;distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework;raw sensory data;sensor data analyst;sensor data integrity;sensor data quality;sensor data trustworthiness;sensor network deployment;statistical data summary","","2","","","","","8-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.","","","","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947","Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis","Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine","","0","","21","","","24-26 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An integrated one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) mechanism that is distributed in a SCADA network is presented, as a part of an intrusion detection system, providing accurate information about the origin and the time of an intrusion. The module reads the network traffic, splits traffic according to the source of the packets and creates a cluster of OCSVM models.

An IDS audits UAVs in a distributed system to determine if the UAVs are functioning normally or are operating under malicious attacks. We investigate the impact of reckless, random, and opportunistic attacker behaviors (modes which many historical cyber attacks have used) on the effectiveness of our behavior rule-based UAV IDS (BRUIDS) which bases its audit on behavior rules to quickly assess the survivability of the UAV facing malicious attacks. Through a comparative analysis with the multiagent system/ant-colony clustering model, we demonstrate a high detection accuracy of BRUIDS for compliant performance. By adjusting the detection strength, BRUIDS can effectively trade higher false positives for lower false negatives to cope with more sophisticated random and opportunistic attackers to support ultrasafe and secure UAV applications.","2168-2216","","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2265083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573382","Intrusion detection;security;unmanned air vehicles (UAVs)","Actuators;Gears;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pricing;Sensors;Weapons","ant colony optimisation;autonomous aerial vehicles;multi-agent systems;security of data","BRUIDS;IDS;UAV;adaptive intrusion detection;airborne system;ant-colony clustering model;behavior rule specifications;distributed system;malicious attacks;malicious unmanned air vehicles;multiagent system;opportunistic attacker behaviors;random attacker behaviors;reckless attacker behaviors","","5","","30","","2013-08-02","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the routinely produced analytical data from computer networks are usually of very huge in size. This creates a major challenge to IDSs, which need to examine all features in the data to identify intrusive patterns. The objective of this study is to analyze and select the more discriminate input features for building computationally efficient and effective schemes for an IDS. For this, a hybrid feature selection algorithm in combination with wrapper and filter selection processes is designed in this paper. Two main phases are involved in this algorithm. The upper phase conducts a preliminary search for an optimal subset of features, in which the mutual information between the input features and the output class serves as a determinant criterion. The selected set of features from the previous phase is further refined in the lower phase in a wrapper manner, in which the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) is used to guide the selection process and retain optimized set of features. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through building an IDS and a fair comparison with other stateof-the-art detection approaches. The experimental results show that our hybrid model is promising in detection compared to the previously reported results.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011237","Feature selection;Floating search;Intrusion detection;Least square support vector machines;Mutual information","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Mutual information;Redundancy;Support vector machines;Training","feature selection;filtering theory;least squares approximations;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;LSSVM;feature selection approach;filter selection process;intrusion detection data classification;least square support vector machine;wrapper selection process","","0","","30","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we show that by using a concept of urgent data, our system can shorten the response time for most 'urgent' queries while guarantee lower bandwidth consumption. We argue that monitoring data can be treated differently. Some data capture critical system events; the arrival of these data will significantly influence the monitoring reaction speed which is called urgent data. High speed urgent data collections can help system to react in real time when facing fatal errors. A cloud environment in production, MagicCube, is used as a test bed. Extensive experiments over both real world and synthetic traces show that when using urgent data, monitoring system can lower the response latency compared with existing monitoring approaches.","1673-5447","","","10.1109/CC.2014.6827565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827565","cloud computing;cloud monitoring;constraint;rule engine;urgent data","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Monitoring","cloud computing;query processing","MagicCube;bandwidth consumption;cloud environment monitoring systems;critical system events;data arrival;data collection differentiation;data collections;data streams;high-speed urgent data collections;information processing applications;monitoring data;monitoring reaction speed;monitoring services;response latency;response time;system performance;urgent data concept;urgent queries","","0","","","","","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most anomaly detection approaches using MLP can detect novel real-time attacks, but still has high false alarm rates. Most attacks are composed of a series of anomaly events. These attacks are called time-delayed attacks, which current neural network IDSs (intrusion detection system) cannot identify efficiently. A hybrid MLP/CNN neural network is constructed in order to improve the detection rate of time-delayed attacks. While obtaining a similarly detection rate of real-time attacks as the MLP does, the proposed approach can detect time-delayed attacks efficiently with chaotic neuron. This approach also exhibits a lower false alarm rate when detects novel attacks. The simulation tests are conducted using DARPA 1998 dataset. The experimental results are presented and compared in ROC curves, which can demonstrate that the proposed approach performs exceptionally in terms of both detection rate and false alarm rate","","0-7695-2528-8","","10.1109/ISDA.2006.253765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021817","","Cellular neural networks;Chaos;Collaborative work;Educational programs;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Leak detection;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Real time systems","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;chaotic neural network;false alarm;hybrid MLP-CNN;intrusion detection system;multilayer perceptron;time-delayed attacks","","3","","22","","","16-18 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, dIDS architectures suffer from many limitations such as the lack of a central analyzer and a heavy network load. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for dIDS, called a collaborative architecture for dIDS (C-dIDS), to overcome these limitations. The C-dIDS contains one-level hierarchy dIDS with a non-central analyzer. To make the detection decision for a specific IDS module in the system, this IDS module needs to collaborate with the IDS in the lower level of the hierarchy. Cooperating with lower level IDS module improves the system accuracy with less network load (just one bit of information). Moreover, by using one hierarchy level, there is no central management and processing of data so there is no chance for a single point of failure. We have examined the feasibility of our dIDS architecture by conducting several experiments using the DARPA dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can deliver satisfactory system performance with less network load.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356567","","Collaboration;Computational intelligence;Computer architecture;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis","security of data","DARPA dataset;attack tools;collaborative architecture;distributed intrusion detection system;network technologies;noncentral analyzer;one-level hierarchy dIDS;security","","3","","31","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
