However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","12","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Exploits are many times used by worms to fast propagate across the full Internet being Web servers one of their main targets. New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.","1060-9857","978-0-7695-3826-6","","10.1109/SRDS.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421","exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware","Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server","Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security","HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit","","1","1","36","","","27-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NRS can be used for detecting polymorphic worms since these worms often remain the same relationship between bytes in changing their patterns. Two signature generation algorithm based on expectation-maximization (EM) and Gibbs Sampling are designed to generate NRS. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of NRS and the correctness of the process of signatures generation.

Most prevalent among them are spoof threats, in which one network device changes its network identifiers to that of another network device. One of the possible reasons of spoofing in wireless network is that per-frame source authentication is not provided. Full scale authentication can be provided, but it is not always desirable as it requires reliable key management. The attacker can further launch Denial of Service attacks by spoofing deauthentication/disassociation or power saving frames, can bypass the access control list or can falsely advertise services to wireless clients. This paper discusses some of the non cryptographic techniques to detect MAC spoofing along with their pros and cons and the network scenarios in which they can be used. Analysis of these techniques is done on data captured from live test bed. The information in this paper can help the wireless equipment manufacturers to implement intrusion detection systems capable of detecting MAC address spoofing efficiently with least number of false alarms.","1556-6463","978-1-4244-3805-1","","10.1109/ICON.2008.4772621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772621","","Access control;Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Power system protection;Radio frequency;Testing;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","access protocols;wireless LAN","MAC spoof detection;access control;denial of service attacks;full scale authentication;intrusion detection systems;network identifiers;non-cryptographic methods;per-frame source authentication;power saving frames;security threats;wireless LAN;wireless network","","3","","18","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system.

In this paper, relying on the processing power of general purpose graphics cards - which seem to be a better option compared to other hardware technologies like FPGAs with regard to speed, scalability, flexibility, ease of programming and price - and with the idea of having the signature-based detection engine of NIDS systems run on GPU rather than CPU, it is tried to present an efficient method to increase the speed of intrusion detection systems such as Snort. The proposed method provides a means to perform payload matching and non-payload matching of packets in a parallel platform on GPU, which can speed up the signature-based detection engine of Snort 3.6.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599567","Attack Signatures;Graphics Card;Network Intrusion Detection Systems;Pattern Matching;Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays;Graphics;Graphics processing units;Pattern matching;Payloads;Throughput","Internet;computer network security;graphics processing units;parallel processing;pattern matching","FPGAs;Internet threats;NIDS;Snort 3.6;attack signature matching;general purpose graphics cards;graphics processors;hardware technologies;high-performance intrusion detection systems;network communications;network intrusion detection systems;packet body inspection;packet header inspection;parallel platform;pattern matching;payload matching;signature-based detection engine;time-consuming evaluation","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these problems, sensor nodes are used to make optimized decisions from a set of accessible strategies to achieve design goals.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","27","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e.g., “Atak” worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms. We propose different integrated schemes for fighting different self-disciplinary worms, and evaluate their performance via real-world traffic data.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313807","Worm;anomaly detection.;game theory","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Distributed computing;Forensics;Game theory;Traffic control;Web and internet services","Internet;game theory;invasive software","Internet;detection probability;game theoretic formulation;self-disciplinary worms;worm detection schemes;worm propagation","","4","","61","","2009-11-06","Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The human body selectively reflects, diffracts and scatters the radio signal which affects the received signal strength. This paper presents an approach to detecting human activity using fluctuations in the received signal strength. These fluctuations are detected using an overcomplete dictionary based pattern recognition algorithm. Performance results are presented which show that the proposed system has an accuracy of 86% in detecting human activity.

The gathering of information and analysis on the anomalies activity can be classified into fast and slow attack. Since fast attack activity make a connection in few second and uses a large amount of packet, detecting this early connection provide the administrator one step ahead in deflecting further damages towards the network infrastructure.

Malicious executables are analyzed using two approaches: disassembly, utilizing IDA-Pro, and the application of a dedicated state machine in order to obtain the set of functions comprising the executables. The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors.

Under this approach, the ID/IP system consists of a core engine with data sensor, detector, configuration device and alert and response device as its main components. The data sensors posting as designated agents are to gather information from their respective sources in real time. The information gathered by the respective agent is fed into the detector where correlation methods and data mining techniques are employed to analyze and identify any intrusive activity or event. Since information is gathered from various sources by the respective agent, different type of profiles representing normal behavior such as network traffic, users, systems, applications, transactions, alarms and alerts can be built, and deviation from these profiles are considered to be intrusion. A rating model is then used to evaluate the intrusive activities. When an intrusion or attack is detected by the detector and evaluated to have a rating below the threshold value, the configuration device changes the status of the ID/IP system to alert mode and signal the alert and response device to take the necessary actions. Subsequently, mobile response agents are used to carry out response mechanisms at the target and the source","","0-7803-9741-X","0-7803-9741-X","10.1109/ISCIT.2006.339856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141335","","Correlation;Data mining;Detectors;Engines;Event detection;Information analysis;Intelligent sensors;Intrusion detection;Mobile agents;Sensor systems","competitive intelligence;data mining;mobile agents;security of data","alert device;application-based intrusion detection;business intelligence applications;configuration device;correlation methods;data mining;data sensor;mobile agent technologies;prevention system;response device","","1","","16","","","Oct. 18 2006-Sept. 20 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to model normal behaviors accurately and improve the performance of intrusion detection, a joint evolutionary neural network (JENN) is presented in this paper. Input features, network structure and connection weights are evolved jointly using genetic algorithm. To evolve all three tasks jointly, a hybrid representation scheme is employed, and penalty factors for the number of input nodes and hidden nodes are introduced into fitness function.

In this paper, we propose a model-based technique for building intrusion detection systems (IDS) for smart meters, that takes these constraints into account.

A number of ID techniques proposed for dynamic wireless networks (e.g., sensor, ad-hoc and mobile ad-hoc networks) are based on the creation of an overlay hierarchy or other structure to organize the collection and processing of ID data. The particular structure chosen may significantly impact the ID system's performance with respect to network overhead, responsiveness, scalability, detection latency, resiliency to failures, and other factors. In this paper, we propose the formal definition and quantification of resiliency and detection latency. Specifically, we introduce analytical expressions that map ID structures to the metric space of real numbers. We define this mapping for a) various types of tree structures that have been proposed previously for dynamic wireless systems and b) a hypercube structure that presents promising resiliency characteristics.

This paper illustrates how a blended strategy of using a low overhead tripwire can be combined with more sophisticated detection mechanisms to provide an effective protection system for limited resource wireless information technology devices.","","978-1-4244-7091-4","","10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5612449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5612449","","Batteries;Bluetooth;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Servers;Wireless communication","Bluetooth;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","B-SIPS;Bluetooth attack detection;MVP-IDS;Snort-Based Wi-Fi;anomalous IC drain;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;instantaneous current drain;malicious packet stream;multvector portable intrusion detection system;portable information device;signature system;wireless attack traffic","","0","","6","","","Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, a high-performance signature matching scheme is of great importance for a signature-based IDS. In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort. The experimental results indicate that our proposed model can achieve promising performance in such a cloud environment.","","","","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831916","Cloud Computing;Exclusive Signature Matching;Intrusion Detection;Parallel Model","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Graphics processing units;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Throughput","cloud computing;computer network security;digital signatures;parallel processing;pattern matching","IDS as a service;IDSaaS;cloud computing;cloud environment;cloud-based parallel exclusive signature matching model;high-performance signature matching scheme;signature-based IDS;signature-based intrusion detection systems","","0","","41","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Apart from the advantages the cloud offers, it can also bring in some potential security threats to the organization by not having organization specific firewalls, monitoring mechanisms and physical security. This limits the chances that companies move onto the cloud, which could have otherwise become an extremely attractive alternative for the businesses. The need is to make cloud services more reliable and trustworthy for the businesses by providing a proper security mechanism that addresses the existing drawbacks in cloud computing. The key is a firewall model that constitutes a centralized Cloud Firewall Management Server and Firewall Clients that communicate with the Cloud Firewall Management Server. This enables the organizations to maintain their own control over the firewall and firewall policies. This model does not share any information with the cloud service provider thereby providing a fully trusted solution for the businesses and additionally caters for the audit needs of the businesses by making all the information available at the central Cloud Firewall Management Server.","","978-1-4799-0908-7","","10.1109/ICIInfS.2013.6731960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6731960","Cloud computing;Firewall;Security","Cloud computing;Companies;Computational modeling;Security;Servers","client-server systems;cloud computing;firewalls;organisational aspects;trusted computing","business audit;business world;centralized cloud firewall management server;cloud computing;cloud service provider;cloud services;firewall clients;firewall policies;information sharing;infrastructure maintenance;monitoring mechanisms;organization security threats;physical security;trustworthy computing","","0","","9","","","17-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique is implemented in a feedforward neural network that uses a Gaussian radial basis function as the model generator. An evaluation based on the inclusiveness and exclusiveness of samples with respect to specific criteria is applied to accretively learn the output clusters of the neural network.

These days every protected zone is facing numerous security threats like trespassing or damaging of important equipments and a lot more. Unwanted intrusion has turned out to be a growing problem which has paved the way for a newer technology which detects intrusion accurately. Almost all organizations have their own conventional arrangement of protecting their zones by constructing high wall, wire fencing, power fencing or employing guard for manual observation. In case of large areas, manually observing the perimeter is not a viable option. To solve this type of problem we have developed a wall-mounted wireless fencing system. In this project I took the responsibility of studying how the different units could be collaborated and how the data collected from them could be further processed with the help of software, which was developed by me. The Intrusion detection system constitutes an important field of application for IR and microwave based wireless sensor network. A state of the art wall-mounted wireless intrusion detection system will detect intrusion automatically, through multi-level detection mechanism (IR, microwave, active RFID & camera) and will generate multi-level alert (buzzer, images, segment illumination, SMS, E-Mail) to notify security officers, owners and also illuminate the particular segment where the intrusion has happened. This system will enable the authority to quickly handle the emergency through identification of the area of incident at once and to take action quickly. IR based perimeter protection is a proven technology. However IR-based intrusion detection - ystem is not a full-proof solution since (1) IR may fail in foggy or dusty weather condition & hence it may generate false alarm. Therefore we amalgamate this technology with Microwave based intrusion detection which can work satisfactorily in foggy weather. Also another significant arena of our proposed system is the Camera-based intrusion detection. Some industries require this feature to capture the snap-shots of the affected location instantly as the intrusion happens. The Intrusion information data are transmitted wirelessly to the control station via multi hop routing (using active RFID or IEEE 802.15.4 protocol). The Control station will receive intrusion information at real time and analyze the data with the help of the Intrusion software. It then sends SMS to the predefined numbers of the respective authority through GSM modem attached with the control station engine.","","978-1-4799-2353-3","","10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921795","IEEE 802.15.4;IR Transceiver Module;Wireless Sensor Network","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cameras;cellular radio;electronic messaging;radio transceivers;safety systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","GSM modem;IEEE 802.15.4 protocol;IR based intrusion detection system;IR based perimeter protection;IR transceiver module;active RFID;central control station;intelligent wall mounted wireless fencing system;intrusion software;microwave based intrusion detection;microwave sensor technology;multihop routing;multilevel detection mechanism;wall mounted wireless intrusion detection system;wireless camera;wireless mesh network;wireless sensor actuator network","","0","","14","","","3-5 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The `selective' characteristic makes SF attacks hard to be distinguished from the normal packet drops or poor receptions in a volatile wireless environment. To understand this stealthy attack, an analytical model is developed to estimate the wellness of a node's forwarding behavior. Further analysis examines the cases where multiple nodes launch SF attacks in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), where we borrow the idea of the PageRank algorithm to estimate the most susceptible nodes to SF attacks in a network. Based on the analyses, we develop a novel reactive routing scheme that bypass suspicious nodes by estimating parent node's reliability and link quality in an integrated manner. The proposed scheme is compared to traditional approaches that also use the Node Reliability Estimator (NRE). The simulation results show that the bypass scheme provides resilience to SF attacks by achieving over 95% data delivery ratio (DDR) consistently and signif cantly outperforms the baseline Collection Tree Protocol and other algorithms without incurring additional overhead across a comprehensive set of test scenarios.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997490","","Communication system security;Protocols;Reliability;Routing;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DDR;NRE;PageRank algorithm;SF attacks;WSN;analytical model;baseline collection tree protocol;data delivery ratio;data transmission integrity;link quality;node forwarding behavior;parent node reliability estimation;reactive routing scheme;selective forwarding attack suppression;volatile wireless environment;wireless sensor networks","","0","","21","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, the model employs Dempster-Shafer theory to handle uncertainties and ignorance existed in the multiple risk factors. Threats in different kinds of severity levels are identified.

They are the last line of defense against malicious hackers and help detect ongoing attacks as well as mitigate their damage. However, intrusion detection systems are not turnkey solutions but are heavily dependent on expensive and scarce security experts for successful operation. By emphasizing self-learning algorithms, we can reduce dependence on the domain expert but instead require massive amounts of labeled training data, another scarce resource in intrusion detection. In this paper, we investigate whether an active learning algorithm can perform on a par with a traditional self-learning algorithm in terms of detection accuracy but using significantly less labeled data. Our preliminary findings indicate that the active learning algorithm generally performs better than the traditional learning algorithm given the same amount of training data. Moreover, the reduction of labeled data needed can be as much as 80 times, shown by comparing an active learner with a traditional learner with similar detection accuracy. Thus, active learning algorithms seem promising in that they can reduce the dependence on security experts in the development of new detection rules by better leveraging the knowledge and time of the expert.","1063-6900","0-7695-2169-X","","10.1109/CSFW.2004.1310734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1310734","","Computer hacking;Computer security;Counting circuits;Data mining;Data security;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Traffic control;Training data","expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","active learner;active learning;attack detection;detection accuracy;detection rules;expert knowledge;intrusion detection systems;labeled data;malicious hackers;operational computer security;security experts;self-learning algorithm;traditional learner;training data","","9","8","25","","","28-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols. Advantages and Disadvantages have also been described in existing techniques to carry out research in this problem.","","978-1-4577-1385-9","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075132","Attacks;DDoS;IP Spoofing;IP Traceback;Zombies","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Probabilistic logic","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDOS attacks;IP routing;IP spoofing;IP traceback;Internet connection;Internet security;compromised hosts;distributed denial-of-service;router functions;traceback techniques","","3","","22","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20071105","2007","","","164","173","It is crucial to detect zero-day polymorphic worms and to generate signatures at the edge network gateways or honeynets so that we can prevent the worms from propagating at their early phase. However, most existing network-based signatures generated are not vulnerability-based and can be easily evaded by attacks. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","","978-1-4244-1588-5","978-1-4244-1588-5","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","12","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current research focuses concentrate on how to effective reduce high false alarm rate and usually ignore the fact that the poor quality data for the modeling of normal patterns as well as the high computational cost make the current anomaly detection methods not act as well as we expect. Based on these, we first propose a novel data mining scheme for network anomaly detection in this paper. Moreover, we adopt data reduction mechanisms (including genetic algorithm (GA) based instance selection and filter based feature selection methods) to boost the detection performance, meanwhile reduce the computational cost of TCM-KNN. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate the proposed method can effectively detect anomalies with high detection rates, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, the data reduction mechanisms would greatly improve the performance of TCM-KNN and make it be a good candidate for anomaly detection in practice.","","1-4244-1304-4","1-4244-1304-4","10.1109/IAW.2007.381936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267564","Anomaly Detection;Data Reduction;Network Security;TCM-KNN Algorithm","Computational efficiency;Conferences;Costs;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Testing","data mining;data reduction;genetic algorithms;security of data;telecommunication security","computational cost;data mining scheme;data reduction mechanism;filter based feature selection methods;genetic algorithm;instance selection;network anomaly detection scheme","","2","","15","","","20-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address the intrusion detection problem in heterogeneous networks consisting of nodes with different noncorrelated security assets. In our study, two crucial questions are: What are the expected behaviors of rational attackers? What is the optimal strategy of the defenders (IDSs)? We answer the questions by formulating the network intrusion detection as a noncooperative game and performing an in-depth analysis on the Nash equilibrium and the engineering implications behind. Based on our game theoretical analysis, we derive the expected behaviors of rational attackers, the minimum monitor resource requirement, and the optimal strategy of the defenders. We then provide guidelines for IDS design and deployment. We also show how our game theoretical framework can be applied to configure the intrusion detection strategies in realistic scenarios via a case study. Finally, we evaluate the proposed game theoretical framework via simulations. The simulation results show both the correctness of the analytical results and the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2009.2019154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4815406","Game theory;Nash equilibrium (NE);intrusion detection system (IDS)","","game theory;security of data","Nash equilibrium;game theoretical analysis;heterogeneous networks;intrusion detection systems;noncooperative game;optimal strategy;security infrastructure","","17","","14","","2009-04-17","June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, an attempt is made to design an intrusion detection model based on the probabilistic approach, first-order Markov chain process, to effectively detection and predict network intrusions. As a first step, the states are defined using clustering techniques for the network traffic profiles; secondly state transition probability matrix and initial probability distribution are determined based on the states defined. Based on the network states, the probability of event occurrence is stochastically measured if the value is lesser than the predefined probability then it event is predicted as anomaly. The proposed probabilistic model performance is evaluated through experiments using KDD Cup99 dataset. The proposed models achieve better detection rate while the attacks are detected in levels of stages.","","978-1-4799-8466-4","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229705","First - Order Markov Chain Process;Intrusion Detection System;Probabilistic Approach;State Transition Matrix","Internet;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Telecommunication traffic","Markov processes;data integrity;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;probability;security of data;telecommunication traffic","FOMC technique;KDD Cup99 dataset;clustering techniques;data availability;data confidentiality;data integrity;first order Markov chain process;initial probability distribution;intrusion detection model design;network traffic profiles;probabilistic model performance;state transition probability matrix","","0","","16","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is developed to identify these network attacks by a set of rules. However, searching for multiple patterns is a computationally expensive task in NIDS. Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance. The first technique performs the w-byte suffix pattern match instead of using w-byte prefix. The second technique finds the matching results from all groups rather than first group.

These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces ""noise"" due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process. This study suggests that unless an accurate and robust flow classification process is in place, automatic syntactic-based signature generators are vulnerable to such noise injection attacks","1081-6011","0-7695-2574-1","","10.1109/SP.2006.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623998","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Noise generators;Noise level;Noise robustness;Pollution;Protection","invasive software","Polygraph;automatic syntactic-based signature generators;flow classifier;honeynet;imprecision inflow classification;intrusion detection system;misleading worm signature generators;noise injection attacks;robust flow classification;suspicious flows;syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators","","16","6","28","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
