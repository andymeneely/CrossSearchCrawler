"High-Performance Intrusion Detection Using OptiGrid Clustering and Grid-Based Labelling","Ishida, M.; Takakura, H.; Okabe, Y.","Grad.

Most of past studies of anomaly based IDS adopt k-means based clustering, this paper points out that the following reasons cause performance degradation of k-means based clustering when it is deployed in real traffic environment. First, k-means based algorithms have weakness for high dimensional data. Second, in spite of non-hyper spherical distribution of normal traffic in a feature space, these algorithms can only create hyper spherical clusters. Furthermore, unsophisticated algorithms to label clusters cannot achieve high detection performance. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a modification of OptiGrid clustering and a cluster labelling algorithm using grids. OptiGrid has robust ability to high dimensional data. Our labelling algorithm divides the feature space into grids and labels clusters using the density of grids. The combination of these two algorithms enables a system to extract the feature of traffic data and classifies the data as attack or normal correctly. We have implemented our system and confirmed efficiency of our system by utilizing both KDDCUP1999 data sets and Kyoto 2006+ data sets.","","978-1-4577-0531-1","978-0-7695-4423-6","10.1109/SAINT.2011.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004129","OptiGrid;anomaly based IDS;cluster labelling;clustering;intrusion detection system","Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Labeling;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals;Sensitivity;Training data","feature extraction;grid computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","KDDCUP1999 data sets;Kyoto 2006+ data sets;OptiGrid clustering;anomaly based IDS;feature extraction;feature space;grid based labelling;hyper spherical clusters;intrusion detection system;k-means clustering;normal traffic distribution;traffic data","","3","","16","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","0196-2892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine","","91","1","46","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, packet analysis systems examine network traffic to detect active botnets and spreading worms. However, with the advent of multi-gigabit link speeds, capturing and analysing header and payload of every packet requires enormous amounts of computational resources and is therefore not feasible in many situations. We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets. Thus, our sampling algorithm can be deployed in front of a detection system to reduce the amount of inspected packets without degrading the detection results significantly.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-5366-5","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488473","","Filters;Forensics;High-speed networks;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Out of order;Payloads;Runtime;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;sampling methods","Bloom filters;TCP connections;botnet detection;malware;network security;packet sampling;sampling algorithm;worm detection","","5","","25","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the applications in this family need to search for predefined signatures in the packet payload. Hence an important building block of these processors is string matching infrastructure. Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters. We outline our approach for string matching at line speeds and present a performance analysis. Finally, we report the results for a prototype implementation of this system on the FPX platform. Our analysis shows that with the state-of-the-art FPGAs, a set of 10,000 strings can be scanned in the network data at the line speed of OC-48 (2.4 Gbps).","","0-7695-2012-X","","10.1109/CONECT.2003.1231477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231477","","Application software;Data structures;Hardware;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Inspection;Packet switching;Payloads;Performance analysis","data structures;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;packet switching;query processing;string matching","2.4 Gbit/s;FPGA;FPX platform;Internet security;content-based billing;deep packet inspection;false positive elimination;hardware Bloom filters;hash functions;layer-7 switching;membership queries data structure;network data line speed;network packet processing;packet payload predefined signatures;parallel Bloom filters;payload inspection;payload scanning;string matching infrastructure","","88","59","15","","","20-22 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both PCA and PLS assume that the data to be analysed are not self-correlated i.e. time-independent. However, most industrial processes are dynamic so that the assumption of time-independence made by the PCA and the PLS is invalid in nature. Dynamic extensions to PCA and PLS, so called DPCA and DPLS, have been developed to address this problem, however, unsatisfactorily. Nevertheless, the Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) is a state-space-based monitoring tool, hence is more suitable for dynamic monitoring than DPCA and DPLS. The CVA is a linear tool and traditionally for simplicity, the upper control limit (UCL) of monitoring metrics associated with the CVA is derived based on a Gaussian assumption. However, most industrial processes are nonlinear and the Gaussian assumption is invalid for such processes so that CVA with a UCL based on this assumption may not be able to correctly identify underlying faults. In this work, a new monitoring technique using the CVA with UCLs derived from the estimated probability density function through kernel density estimations (KDEs) is proposed and applied to the simulated nonlinear Tennessee Eastman Process Plant. The proposed CVA with KDE approach is able to significantly improve the monitoring performance and detect faults earlier when compared to other methods also examined in this study.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2009.2032654","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290125","Canonical variate analysis (CVA);kernel density estimation (KDE);probability density function (PDF);process monitoring","","Gaussian distribution;fault diagnosis;principal component analysis;process monitoring","Gaussian assumption;Kernel density estimations;PCA;Tennessee Eastman Process Plant;canonical variate analysis;fault detection;industrial processes;nonlinear dynamic process monitoring;partial least squares;principal component analysis","","21","","19","","2009-10-20","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since there is no central controller to determine the reliable & Secure communication paths in Mobile Adhoc Network, each node in the ad hoc network has to rely on each other in order to forward packets, thus highly cooperative nodes are required to ensure that the initiated data transmission process does not fail. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) where security is a crucial issue and they are forced to rely on the neighbor node, trust plays an important role that could improve the number of successful data transmission. Larger the number of trusted nodes, higher successful data communication process rates could be expected.

This paper presents an approach to detect intrusion based on data mining frame work. In the framework, intrusion detection is thought of as clustering. The reduction algorithm is presented to cancel the redundant attribute set and obtain the optimal attribute set to form the input of the FCM. To find the reasonable initial centers easily, the advanced FCM is established, which improves the performance of intrusion detection since the traffic is large and the types of attack are various. In the illustrative example, the number of attributes is reduced greatly and the detection is in a high precision for the attacks of DoS and Probe, a low false positive rate in all types of attacks.","","978-1-4244-5821-9","","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497340","FCM;data mining;intrusion detection","Availability;Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Computer networks;Data engineering;Data mining;Information security;Intrusion detection;Probes","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data","DoS attack;FCM;Probe;data mining techniques;fuzzy c-means clustering;intrusion detection approach;optimal attribute set;reduction algorithm;redundant attribute set","","2","","18","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection system (IDS) not only prevents adversaries from attacking the network, but also provides attackspsila features for improving the preventive algorithms. The traditional intrusion detection algorithms canpsilat be applied directly to WSNs due to their constraints of resources.

This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components.

However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787363","Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI);energy-theft detection;security;smart grid","Companies;Electricity;Power system reliability;Reliability;Security;Smart grids;Wide area networks","","","","1","","","","","April 2014","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

The attacks like DoS, U2R, R2L and Probing etc., creating a serious threat to the appropriate operation of Internet services as well as in host system. In recent years, intrusion detection system is designed to prevent the intruder in the host as well as in network systems. Existing host based intrusion detection systems detects the intrusion using complete feature set and it is not fast enough to detect the attacks. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an efficient HIDS - Correlation based Partial Decision Tree Algorithm (CPDT). The proposed CPDT combines Correlation feature selection for selecting features and Partial Decision Tree (PART) for classifying the normal and the abnormal packets. The algorithm is implemented and has been validated within KDD'99 dataset and found to give better results than the existing algorithms. The proposed CPDT model provides the accuracy of 99.9458%.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996115","CFS;DoS;IDS;Intruder;Probing;R2L;U2R","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Correlation;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","CPDT algorithm;DoS attack;HIDS;Internet service operation;KDD'99 dataset;PART;Probing attack;R2L attack;U2R attack;abnormal packet classification;correlation feature selection;correlation feature selection algorithm;correlation-based partial decision tree algorithm;host system;host-based intrusion detection system;network systems;normal packet classification;system security","","0","","16","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Port scanning detection has received a lot of attention by researchers. However a slow port scan attack can deceive most of the existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this paper, we present a new, simple, and efficient method for detecting slow port scans. Our proposed method is mainly composed of two phases: (1) a feature collection phase that analyzes network traffic and extracts the features needed to classify a certain IP as malicious or not. (2) A classification phase that divides the IPs, based on the collected features, into three groups: normal IPs, suspicious IPs and scanner IPs. The IPs our approach classify as suspicious are kept for the next (K) time windows for further examination to decide whether they represent scanners or legitimate users. Hence, this approach is different than the traditional approach used by IDSs that classifies IPs as either legitimate or scanners, and thus producing a high number of false positives and false negatives. A small Local Area Network was put together to test our proposed method. The experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method in correctly identifying malicious scanners when both normal and slow port scan were performed using the three most common TCP port scanning techniques. Moreover, our method detects malicious scanners that are otherwise not detected using well known IDSs such as Snort.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122824","Intrusion Detection System;Port Scanning","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;IP networks;Probes;Security;Servers;Training data","local area networks;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IDS;TCP port scanning techniques;feature collection phase;intrusion detection systems;local area network;reconnaissance technique attackers;slow port scanning detection","","3","","20","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present experimental results how to use the energy/power consumption logs of a power monitored server as a side-channel that allows us to recognize the exact combination of VMs it currently hosts to a high degree. For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition. As a result, energy consumption data of servers must be protected carefully, as it is potentially valuable information for an attacker trying to track down a VM to mount further attack steps.","","978-1-4673-0006-3","","10.1109/DASC.2011.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119058","","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Energy measurement;Power demand;Power measurement;Servers;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;power aware computing;virtual machines","Kolmogorov-Smirnov test;VM;cloud computing;data centers;energy consumption side channel attack;energy efficiency;energy/power consumption;hardware platform;power measurement device;power monitored server;virtual machines","","3","","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With such a formulation, a series of samples can be seen as a sequence of frames or video, revealing certain kinds of attacks to the human eye. This enables techniques from image processing and video compression to be applied to the packet header data to reveal interesting properties of traffic. We show that ""scene change analysis"" can reveal sudden changes in traffic behavior or anomalies. We also show that ""motion prediction"" techniques can be employed to understand the patterns of some of the attacks.

Intrusion detection rates would be better if we know which network features are more important for a particular pattern.

An attack could consist of a large number of packet streams generated by many compromised slaves that consume resources associated with various network elements to deny normal services or a few offending packets to disable a system. Several techniques based on probabilistic samples of transit packets have been developed, to determine the sources of large packet flows. It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases. In this paper, we propose packet digesting schemes for flows and sets of packets sharing the same source and destination addresses. Compared with the individual packet digesting scheme, these schemes can achieve similar goals and are much more scalable. Simulations with real Internet traffic show that the storage requirements of our proposed schemes are one to two orders of magnitude lower.","","0-7803-8533-0","","10.1109/ICC.2004.1312653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1312653","","Communication system security;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Electronic mail;Filtering;IP networks;Internet;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication links;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Bloom filters;IP traceback;Internet security;Internet traffic;destination addresses;distributed denial of service;link capacity;packet digesting schemes;packet sharing;packet streams;source addresses;transit packets","","10","1","17","","","20-24 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SCADA process control systems are typically isolated from the internet via firewalls. However, they may still be subject to illicit cyber penetrations and may be subject to cyber threats from disgruntled insiders. We have developed a set of command injection, data injection, and denial of service attacks which leverage the lack of authentication in many common control system communication protocols including MODBUS, DNP3, and EtherNET/IP.

A Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN) has a set of sensor nodes for monitoring events and a set of high capability nodes, called actor nodes, for reacting to the events. It can provide an infrastructure for building the intrusion detection system in a smart home. We need to jointly consider fault-tolerance and timeliness issues because sensor nodes are likely to be influenced by failures (e.g., dead battery) and need to deliver packets in real time over wireless links vulnerable to interference caused by walls, floors or furniture. In this paper, we propose Optimal Multipath Planning (or OMP), which is based on Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm and Goldberg and Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm, for WSANs to set up paths to deliver intrusion event notification from event sources to actors in a smart home. The planning is optimal in the sense that it sets up the maximum number of node-disjoint paths of links with the minimized expected transmission count (ETX). We also evaluate OMP's performance by simulations and compare it with the minimum cost planning using Dijkstra algorithm to show its advantages.","1530-2016","978-1-4244-7918-4","978-0-7695-4157-0","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599120","Disjoint Path;Maximum-Flow Minimum-Cost Planning;Smart Home;Wireless Sensor and Actor Network","Intrusion detection;Network topology;Planning;Smart homes;Topology;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","fault tolerance;home computing;path planning;security of data;wireless sensor networks","Dijkstra algorithm;Edmonds-Karp maximum flow algorithm;Goldberg minimum cost flow algorithm;Tarjan minimum cost flow algorithm;actor networks;actor nodes;expected transmission count;fault-tolerance;intrusion detection system;intrusion event notification;node-disjoint paths;optimal multipath planning;sensor nodes;smart homes;timeliness issues;wireless links;wireless sensor","","0","","18","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks.

In many situations, there exists a weak anomaly signal detection problem: due to the little number of anomalous system calls, the anomalous patterns of some intrusions may not be enough to distinguish themselves from normal activities so the existing anomaly detection systems can not detect this kind of sequences accurately. Motivated by this, we propose a multi-module anomaly detection scheme to solve this problem through utilizing system call prediction to enlarge the patterns of weak anomaly signal sequences and make them more distinguishable. Besides this, a variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called VV algorithm) is developed to predict the most probable future system calls more efficiently and a Markov-based intrusion detection method is adopted for the pattern value calculation and anomaly detection. The results of our experimental study conclude the followings: (i) the proposed scheme can greatly improve the intrusion detection accuracy of this Markov-based intrusion detection method in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds; (ii) the performance of the proposed scheme depends on the prediction accuracy of the adopted prediction technique; (iii) the developed VV algorithm is exponentially more efficient than a baseline method.","","978-1-4673-6320-4","","10.1109/ICIEA.2013.6566581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566581","","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Signal processing;Training","Markov processes;computer network security;maximum likelihood estimation;signal detection","Markov-based intrusion detection method;VV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;anomalous system calls;anomaly signal detection problem;false alarm rate bounds;multimodule anomaly detection scheme;network intrusion;pattern value calculation;system call prediction","","0","","20","","","19-21 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many solutions were proposed to resolve this problem: Generally, the common practice for dealing with imbalanced data sets is to rebalance them artificially by using sampling methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on Sample Selection (SS), to deal with the problem of between class imbalance. We consider that creating balance between classes by paying more attention to those examples located near the border line improves the performance of the classifier.

Fourth International Conference on","20080624","2007","","","449","458","Unauthorized rogue access points (APs), such as those brought into a corporate campus by employees, pose a security threat as they may be poorly managed or insufficiently secured. Any attacker in the vicinity can easily get onto the internal network through a rogue AP, bypassing all perimeter security measures. Existing detection solutions work well for detecting layer-2 rogue APs. It is a challenge, however, to accurately detect a layer-3 rogue AP that is protected by WEP or other security measures. In this paper, we describe a new rogue AP detection method to address this problem. Our solution uses a verifier on the internal wired network to send test traffic towards wireless edge, and uses wireless sniffers to identify rouge APs that relay the test packets. To quickly sweep all possible rogue APs, the verifier uses a greedy algorithm to schedule the channels for the sniffers to listen to. To work with the encrypted AP traffic, the sniffers use a probabilistic algorithm that only relies on observed packet size. Using extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach can robustly detect rogue APs with moderate network overhead.","","978-1-4244-1432-1","978-1-4244-1433-8","10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550468","","Communication system security;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Protection;Protective relaying;Robustness;Switches;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Wireless LAN","","","","9","","16","","","10-14 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","1","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This report tackles this concern for enterprises in terms of security with intrusion detection while adopting cloud computing. The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network.

One way to address tag cloning is to use the visibility that RFID traces provide to detect cloned tags as soon as they enter the system. However, RFID traces always represent historic events without giving certainty where the traced objects currently really are. Furthermore, imperfect read rates can lead to missing reads. As a result, the visibility is not always perfect, which makes detection of cloned tags harder and less reliable. This paper presents a series of probabilistic techniques to enable reliable detection of cloned tags in cases where the visibility is incomplete. Our hypothesis is that the events generated by cloned tags cause rare or abnormal events that can be detected when the process that generates the legitimate events is understood. The presented techniques are studied in a comprehensive simulation study of a real-world pharmaceutical supply chain. Our findings suggest that reliable detection of cloned tags is possible if missing reads are addressed and the supply chain is precisely modeled.","","978-1-4244-3337-7","978-1-4244-3338-4","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911190","","Authentication;Cloning;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Event detection;Pharmaceuticals;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Supply chains;Technology management","probability;radiofrequency identification","RFID tags cloning;cloned tags detection;incomplete RFID traces;probabilistic techniques;real-world pharmaceutical supply chain","","7","5","23","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flat traffic usually results from repeating similar application-layer actions, such as login attempts in a brute-force attack. For typical attacks, hundreds of attempts span over multiple connections, with each connection containing the same, small number of attempts. The characteristic flat behavior is used by many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes), both for identifying the presence of attacks and - once detected - for observing deviations, pointing out potential compromises, for example. However, flatness of network traffic may become indistinct when TCP retransmissions and control information come into play. These TCP phenomena affect not only intrusion detection, but also other forms of network traffic analysis. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we analyze the impact of retransmissions and control information on network traffic based on traffic measurements. To do so, we have developed a flow exporter extension that was deployed in both a campus and a backbone network. Second, we show that intrusion detection results improve dramatically by up to 16 percentage points once IDSes are able to `flatten' network traffic again, which we have validated by means of analyzing log files of almost 60 hosts over a period of one month.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140301","","Delays;Dictionaries;Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Payloads;Probes","Internet;computer network security;security of data","IDSes;Internet;SSH attack;TCP retransmissions;application layer actions;backbone network;brute force attacks;campus network;flat traffic;flow exporter extension;intrusion detection;intrusion detection systems;network traffic;network traffic analysis;typical attacks","","0","","14","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a concise and scalable representation of these three attributes, that leads to a flexible visualization tool that is also clear and intuitive to use. Within our system, alerts can be grouped and viewed hierarchically with respect to both their type, i.e., the what, and to their where attributes. Further understanding is gained by displaying the temporal distribution of alerts to reveal complex attack trends.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","265","271","A common method of identifying attacks with anomaly network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is to detect significant deviations in network traffic compared to normal conditions. Such changes may include unexpected high traffic volume, caused by, for example, a denial of service (DoS) attack. However, recent research on traffic engineering has demonstrated that modern data network traffic exhibits high burstiness at a wide range of observation window sizes, i.e., self-similarity (V. Paxon et al., 1995, W.E. Leland et al., 1994), The self-similar traffic may challenge the traditional anomaly NIDS by making it unable to distinguish attacks from traffic bursts. In this paper, we investigate the employment of low pass filters in the anomaly NIDS to smooth the burstiness in network traffic measurements and thus reduce the false alarms. We studied the use of the MWA filter and the Savitzky-Golay filter. By analyzing the resulting network traffic measurements, we found out that the MWA filter significantly changed, while the Savitzky-Golay filter only moderately altered, the statistical properties of the network traffic measurements. To investigate the effectiveness of a low pass filter on anomaly NIDS, we applied the low pass filter to our anomaly NIDS, namely, the MIB anomaly intrusion detection (MAID) system. By employing these filters in MAID, we observed that the Savitzky-Golay filter outperforms the MWA filter. The results of the performance evaluation process also demonstrated that the low pass filter can significantly enhance the detection capacity of MAID, by reducing its false alarm rate.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437826","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437826","","Area measurement;Computer crime;Employment;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters;Read only memory;Telecommunication traffic;Time measurement;Volume measurement","computer networks;low-pass filters;performance evaluation;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","MWA filter;Savitzky-Golay filter;anomaly network intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;low pass filters;management information base;network traffic;self-similar traffic;traffic engineering","","0","","8","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As attacks on computer systems are becoming increasingly numerous and sophisticated, there is a growing need for intrusion detection and response systems to dynamically adapt to better detect and respond to attacks. The Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System (AHA! IDS) provides detection adaptation by adjusting the amount of system resources devoted to the task of detecting intrusive activities. This is accomplished by dynamically invoking new combinations of lower level detection agents in response to changing circumstances and by adjusting the confidence associated with these lower-level agents. The Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System (AAIRS) provides response adaptation by weighting those responses that have been successful in the past over those techniques that have not been as successful. As a result, the more successful responses are used more often than the less successful techniques. It also adapts responses based on the system's belief that intrusion detection reports are valid. Intuitively, adaptive detection and response systems will provide more robust protection than static, non-adaptive systems","1062-922X","0-7803-6583-6","","10.1109/ICSMC.2000.884341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=884341","","Automatic control;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Protection;Prototypes;Robustness","adaptive systems;computer crime;software agents","Adaptive Agent-based Intrusion Response System;Adaptive Hierarchical Agent-based Intrusion Detection System;adaptation techniques;computer system attacks;confidence;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response systems;lower level detection agents;protection","","12","5","27","","","2000","08 Oct 2000-11 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes the new intrusion detection technique by using hybrid methods of unsupervised/supervised learning scheme. The proposed technique integrates the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The PCA is applied to reduce high dimensional data vectors and distance between vectors including its projection onto the subspace.

Proceedings of the 36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20030206","2003","","","10 pp.","","This paper describes an approach using hidden Markov models (HMM) to detect complex Internet attacks. These attacks consist of several steps that may occur over an extended period of time. Within each step, specific actions may be interchangeable. A perpetrator may deliberately use a choice of actions within a step to mask the intrusion. In other cases, alternate action sequences may be random (due to noise) or because of lack of experience on the part of the perpetrator. For an intrusion detection system to be effective against complex Internet attacks, it must be capable of dealing with the ambiguities described above. We describe research results concerning the use of HMMs as a defense against complex Internet attacks. We describe why HMMs are particularly useful when there is an order to the actions constituting the attack (that is, for the case where one action must precede or follow another action in order to be effective). Because of this property, we show that HMMs are well suited to address the multi-step attack problem. In a direct comparison with two other classic machine learning techniques, decision trees and neural nets, we show that HMMs perform generally better than decision trees and substantially better than neural networks in detecting these complex intrusions.","","0-7695-1874-5","","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174909","","Computer networks;Decision trees;Hidden Markov models;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Machine learning;Neural networks;Reconnaissance","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;hidden Markov models","Internet;decision trees;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;machine learning techniques;multistage network attacks;multistep attack problem;neural nets","","15","","30","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to the current thrust of alert aggregation efforts, our approach does not require developing elaborate semantic structures for capturing information, nor creating and maintaining an external database containing information on attack vectors, network topologies, and cause-and-effect relationships. We apply our method to 30 days of Snort alerts, grouped by hour, and observe that we can reduce the number of analyst-visible Snort alerts by up to 99.5%, with an average reduction of approximately 83.2%.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-1729-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415777","Computer security;Information security;Intrusion detection","Approximation algorithms;IP networks;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Semantics;Sensors;Vectors","greedy algorithms;pattern clustering;pattern matching;security of data","Snort alerts clustering;alert aggregation efforts;analyst workload reduction;attack vectors;cause-and-effect relationships;greedy aggregation algorithm;network topologies;pattern identification;pattern-matching intrusion detection system","","1","","17","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this problem, we propose SMURFEN: a Rule Sharing intrusion detection network, which provides a platform for IDS users to effectively share their customized detection knowledge in an IDS community.

These are short range wireless types of medium which support radio frequency transmission. It has low weight construction of protocol for movable hand held devices so many functionalities is lost which breaches security concerns. Among all of them most threatening is intrusion which deals with various types of attacks affecting the actual process of device. Intrusions can be prevented by using various preventive and measuring components like acknowledgement, monitoring proxy node, behaviour monitoring and change detection, sudden data dropping and modification, infinite delays etc. In the existing mechanism for IDS the mobility and neighbour behaviour entity is not taken for new nodes or some existing misbehaving node. Behaviour of such nodes intimates the network about intruder's activity & hence IDS can be initiated. So identification and removal of intrusion in timely manner is primary task in IDS. However, there is not a deep study of the impact of such attacks on the performance of routing protocols through simulations. The existing static & dynamic routing protocols like ADOV, DSR, OLSR needs to be updated for providing better security against the issues. Thus to achieve proper security in such network of devices it needs up gradation of protocols. Thus, this work focuses its concern on improving the security issues in AODV through improved Intrusion Detection System. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response (CNMR) Based IDS through AACK for AODV protocol. It is a multistep process in which the node & its transmission are in control of some monitoring node. This node can generate responses on the basis of threshold. This quantity of response can be taken as major consideration for identification of intruder's node. Our prime concern by proposing new updates for security is to demonstrate higher intrusion detectio- rates with minimized performance issues. AT the initial level of our research the work is getting better results in comparison with other existing mechanisms.","","978-1-4799-3063-0","","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056980","AODV (Ad- Hoc on Demand Distance Vector);CNMR (Coordinated Node Monitoring & Response);CTR (Count Total response);IDS (Intrusion Detection System);MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Network)","Abstracts;Art;Delays;Mobile ad hoc networks;Performance evaluation;Radiation detectors;Routing","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","AACK;AODV protocol;CNMR based IDS;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector;coordinated node monitoring & response;count total response;intrusion detection rate;intrusion detection system;mobile ad-hoc network;performance evaluation","","0","","17","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
