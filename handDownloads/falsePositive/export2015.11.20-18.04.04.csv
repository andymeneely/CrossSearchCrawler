ICSCN '08. International Conference on","20080207","2008","","","182","188","Ad hoc networks are a new paradigm of wireless communication for mobile hosts. Security is an important issue for ad hoc networks, especially for those security-sensitive applications. The salient features of ad hoc networks pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals. One such goal is to consider not only malicious attacks launched from outside a network, but also take into account the attacks from within the network by compromised nodes. Various ways are possible to overcome vulnerabilities in Wireless Ad hoc Networks from attacks and threats. One of the most widely used solution is designing an intrusion detection system (IDS) that suites the security needs and characteristics of ad hoc networks for effective and efficient performance against intrusions. This paper investigates the serious and harmful attack, ""denial of service"" (DoS) that exhibit in multiple forms across different layers of protocol stack. To defend against this attack, we propose a novel approach ""cross layer based intrusion detection system""(CIDS) that performs accurate diagnosis of malicious attacks by analyzing the pattern of trace files, overcome the demerits such as false positives present in traditional IDS, thereby providing secure communication between nodes that communicate with each other to route the traffic from source to destination and also increase the efficiency of the network performance. The simulations conducted in ns2 and proved that our work achieved high performance with fewer overheads.","","978-1-4244-1924-1","978-1-4244-1924-1","10.1109/ICSCN.2008.4447185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4447185","AODV;Ad hoc Networks;Cross-layer Design;Denial-of-Service(DoS) attacks;IEEE 802.11;Intrusion Detection;MAC layer;Misuse or Signature Detection;Network Monitor;Routing layer;Security","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Cross layer design;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Protocols;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;protocols;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11;MAC layer;cross layer based intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;malicious attack;network monitor;protocol stack layer;routing layer;signature detection;trace file pattern;wireless ad hoc networks","","2","","16","","","4-6 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Equipped with three-axis accelerometer sensors, we deploy an experimental wireless sensor network on the sea surface to detect ships. Using signal processing techniques and cooperative signal processing, we can detect the passing ships by distinguishing the ship-generated waves and the ocean waves. We design an intrusion detection system in which we propose to exploit spatial and temporal correlations of the intrusion to increase detection reliability.

The classification of records in the KDD dataset into normal and attack records involves mining rules involving the features present in the dataset. Since the KDD dataset contains a huge number of features, mining rules becomes a difficult task. Hence several algorithms have been developed to extract the most relevant set of features that contribute to the accurate classification of records. The selected features should result in the least misclassification rate. This paper presents a fuzzy approach to feature reduction and analyzes the evolved features using classification algorithms in Tanagra.

This KDD CUP 1999 data set was generated by domain expert at MIT Lincon lab. To reduced number of features of this KDD CUP data set, various feature reduction techniques has been already used. These techniques reduce features from 41 into range of 10 to 22. Usage of such reduced dataset in machine learning algorithm leads to lower complexity, less processing time and high accuracy. Out of the various feature reduction technique available, one of them is Information Gain (IG) which has been already applied for the random forests classifier by Tesfahun et al. Tesfahun's approach reduces time and complexity of model and improves the detection rate for the minority classes in a considerable amount. This work investigates the effectiveness and the feasibility of Tesfahun et al.'s feature reduction technique on Back Propagation Neural Network classifier. We had performed various experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset and recorded Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Fscore values. In this work, we had done Basic, N-Fold Validation and Testing comparisons on reduced dataset with full feature dataset. Basic comparison clearly shows that the reduced dataset outer performs on size, time and complexity parameters. Experiments of N-Fold validation show that classifier that uses reduced dataset, have better generalization capacity. During the testing comparison, we found both the datasets are equally compatible. All the three comparisons clearly show that reduced dataset is better or is equally compatible, and does not have any drawback as compared to full dataset. Our experiments shows that usage of such reduced dataset in BPNN can lead to better model in terms of dataset size, complexity, processing time and generalization ability.","","978-1-4799-8487-9","","10.1109/ACCT.2015.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079087","Back Propagation Neural Network;Feature Reduction;Intrusion Detection System;N Fold Validation","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Power capacitors;Testing;Training","backpropagation;data handling;generalisation (artificial intelligence);neural nets","BPNN;Fscore values;IG;KDD CUP 1999 data set;KDD CUP 1999 dataset;MIT Lincon lab;anomaly detection;back propagation neural network classifier;complexity;computer network;dataset size;domain expert;feature reduction techniques;generalization ability;generalization capacity;information gain;machine learning algorithm;n-fold validation;reduced dataset","","0","","25","","","21-22 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel hypothesis in immunology, the danger theory (DT), is emerging to meet these challenges. DT highlights the importance of the tissue and states that antigen presentation must be coupled with its tissue conditions. In order to create a contextually aware IDS with the incorporation of the concept of tissue, a novel algorithm to grow tissue is presented which adopts the theory of data fields in physics. This algorithm has the ability to dynamically cluster antigen data and provides a useful measure to danger signal. In order to reduce the false positive and increase robustness for detection system, a notion of multi-tissues cooperation to sense dangers in IDS is also demonstrated based on the proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4244-2113-8","978-1-4244-2114-5","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593657","Danger Theory;Data Field;Intrusion Detection;Tissue","Artificial immune systems;Clustering algorithms;Computer security;Context awareness;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Protection;Robustness;Signal processing","pattern clustering;security of data","antigen data clustering;antigen presentation;bioinspired multitissues growing algorithm;danger theory;data fields;intrusion detection system","","0","","13","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A promising approach to this problem is to apply linear data transformation and anomaly detection techniques on top of known attack signatures that convey contextual properties. The linear data transformation technique relies on several discriminant functions, which are used to calculate the estimated probability of zero-day attacks by analyzing network connection features. The anomaly detection technique identifies zero-day attacks using the One Class Nearest Neighbor (1-class NN) algorithm, which has been applied using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to achieve dimensionality reduction. An experimental prototype has been implemented to evaluate these techniques using data from the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset.

However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed.

However, high accuracy and small detection delay are conflicting requirements that need to be balanced for optimum detection.

With the deployment of high-speed network, its use has been increased to detect malicious attacks in the packet stream in real time.

The proposed algorithm uses software bitmap for each multi-pattern signature without hardware changes, which maximizes flexibility of content processor. From the analysis of Snort which is the widely used intrusion detection system, we observe spatial locality between distances of patterns in the multi-pattern signature. The algorithm makes use of this distance information for adaptive performance optimization.

As we have come to depend on reliable operations of networked systems, it is important to be able to provide security measures that both efficient in terms of processing speed as well as in detecting attacks that are not in the database. To this end, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems allow detection of previously unknown and never seen attacks, and effectively complement signature-based detection schemes. In this paper, we evaluate a robust intrusion detection scheme with the goal of developing stand-alone devices that can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner to existing systems. Such devices are attractive as it allows an added security feature to quickly be deployed without adding to the management complexity of existing systems. Our system is robust in that it is resilient to contaminated traffic that may be included in real-time training. Leveraging this advantage, we show that our detection system can self-train without the need for a large, sanitized training data set typically required for many anomaly-based detection schemes. This feature naturally lends itself to faster deployment and for managing systems in changing environments. We demonstrate this concept by developing a physical prototype using an embedded platform. Our results show that amount of delay introduced by the device is small. Another attractive feature of the stand alone device is that it is impossible to temper with without physical access to the device, even if host systems are compromised.","1542-1201","978-1-4673-0267-8","978-1-4673-0268-5","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6211906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6211906","","Delay;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Prototypes;Training;Tuning","Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet;anomaly-based intrusion detection systems;complement signature-based detection schemes;embedded platform;management complexity;network intrusion detection;network management tasks;network-based attacks;networked systems;real-time training;sanitized training data set;stand-alone devices","","0","","19","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IP protocol specifies no method for validating the authenticity of the packet's source. This implies that an attacker can forge the source address to be any desired. This is almost exclusively done for malicious or at least inappropriate purposes. Given that attackers can exploit this weakness for many attacks, it would be beneficial to know if network traffic has spoofed source addresses. This knowledge can be particularly useful as an adjunct to reduce false positive from intrusion detection systems.

By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield ""ground truth"" node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by flooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.031912.110179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174485","Trust management;intrusion detection;performance analysis;routing;security;wireless sensor networks","Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Quality of service;Routing;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","probability;quality of service;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","QoS behaviors;anomaly-based intrusion detection approach;cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol design;detection probability;false positive probability;flooding-based routing;ground truth node status;heterogeneous WSN;message delay;message delivery ratio;multidimensional trust attributes;objective trust;optimal trust threshold;probability model;quality of service;sensor node;social networks;subjective trust;trust-based geographic routing approach;trust-based intrusion detection approach;wireless sensor networks","","36","","33","","2012-03-23","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nevertheless, since WSN applications normally require the collection and the aggregation of reliable measurements and data from the sensing units, secure communications should be guaranteed even in the presence of resource constraints. In this paper we then present a novel middleware approach that is directly tailored to an IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN. The security-related components of the proposed middleware include a light yet powerful cryptographic scheme (TAKS) and an Intrusion Detection System (WIDS): the former module exploits the topological properties of a WSN, while the latter one is based on a Weak Process Model approach.","","","","10.1109/Mobilware.2013.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775056","cryptographic scheme;intrusion detection system;middleware;security;wireless sensor networks","Cryptography;IEEE 802.15 Standards;Intrusion detection;Middleware;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","Zigbee;cryptographic protocols;middleware;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks;application layer;cryptographic scheme;distributed resource constrained systems;intrusion detection;middleware platforms;pervasive monitoring;resource constraints;secure communications;secure links management protocol;smart sensing system;weak process model approach","","0","","40","","","11-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two algorithms named TLR and DCA are proposed in this new area that both of them are trying to identify the antigens based on a simple identifier. They suffer from low accuracy due to the fact that they are not taking the structure of antigens into account. In this paper we propose an algorithm called STLR (structural TLR), which is an extended form of TLR algorithm. STLR tries to model the interaction of adaptive and innate biological immune system and at the same time considers the structure of the antigens. In this algorithm, each system call represents an antigen whose structure is determined by the system call's arguments and some other parameters. Our experimental results show that using the structural aspects of an antigen, STLR can lead to a great increase in the detection rate and accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2387-1","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408214","Anomaly Detection;Antigen Structure;Atificial Immune Systems;Danger Theory","Accuracy;Adaptive systems;Intrusion detection;Lymph nodes;Signal processing algorithms;Training","artificial immune systems;security of data","AIS;DCA;IDS;STLR;adaptive biological immune system;adaptive immune system;anomaly detection;antigens;artificial immune systems;computer security;danger theory;innate biological immune system;innate immune system;intrusion detection systems;structural TLR algorithm;system call arguments","","0","","18","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze the contrast of the image in the boundary and textured regions, and group the information with common characteristics. These groups model the relations within the image, from which we extract the transformation functions. The results are then adaptively mixed, by considering the human vision system characteristics, to boost the details in the image. Results show that the algorithm can automatically process a wide range of images—e.g., mixed shadow and bright areas, outdoor and indoor lighting, and face images—without introducing artifacts, which is an improvement over many existing methods.","1057-7149","","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2198667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198348","Channel division;contrast enhancement;contrast pair;dark image enhancement","Dynamic range;Face;Force;Helium;Histograms;Image edge detection;Image enhancement","","","","6","","27","","2012-05-10","Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The signatures enriched with this information significantly brings down the false positives and at the same time enhances the performance of the signature detection module. In this paper we propose a state base signature detection model which leverages on our state aware signatures with sufficiently complete information to match these signatures. The proposed model keeps track of the state of the connection and matches the signatures within appropriate packets. We further classify our signatures that span across multiple packet and across multiple sessions. We also provide the notion of virtual signatures which represents patterns within packets in a distributed form.

One major security problem of the IMS is flooding attacks. There are many works that have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, generally, the detection systems trigger many alarms and most of them are false positives. These false alarms impact the quality of the detection. In this paper, we first present a method to improve the detection accuracy of SIP flooding detection in IMS by using a trust model. The trust value is calculated by a communication activity between a caller and a callee. By this algorithm, the trust value of an attacker is lower than a legitimate user because it does not have real human activities. To evaluate the proposed method, we integrate the trust model with three SIP flooding attack detection algorithms: Cumulative sum, Hellinger distance, and Tanimoto distance. The system is evaluated by using a comprehensive traffic dataset that consists of varying legitimate and malicious traffic patterns. The experimental results show that the trust integration method can reduce false alarms and improve the accuracy of the flooding attack detection algorithms.","","","","10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605798","False Positive;Flooding Attacks;IMS;Trust","Accuracy;Detection algorithms;High definition video;IP networks;Market research;Testing;Training","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;mobile computing;multimedia communication;trusted computing","Hellinger distance;IMS;IP Multimedia Subsystem;Internet applications;SIP flooding attack detection;Tanimoto distance;caller-callee communication activity;cumulative sum;detection system;false positives reduction;legitimate traffic patterns;legitimate user;malicious traffic patterns;mobile services;security problem;trust integration method;trust model;trust value","","1","","21","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, intrusion detection relies on extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been deployed for intrusion detection. An IDS is usually working in a dynamically changing environment, which forces continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model, in order to maintain sufficient performance. The manual tuning process required by current systems depends on the system operators in working out the tuning solution and in integrating it into the detection model. In this paper, an automatically tuning IDS (ATIDS) is presented. The proposed system will automatically tune the detection model on-the-fly according to the feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are encountered. The system is evaluated using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the system achieves up to 35% improvement in terms of misclassification cost when compared with a system lacking the tuning feature. If only 10% false predictions are used to tune the model, the system still achieves about 30% improvement. Moreover, when tuning is not delayed too long, the system can achieve about 20% improvement, with only 1.3% of the false predictions used to tune the model. The results of the experiments show that a practical system can be built based on ATIDS: system operators can focus on verification of predictions with low confidence, as only those predictions determined to be false will be used to tune the detection model","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2006.885306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4126299","Attack detection model;classification;data mining;intrusion detection;learning algorithm;model-tuning algorithm;self-organizing map (SOM)","Computer security;Costs;Data security;Feedback;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Predictive models;Protection","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","automatically tuning intrusion detection system;computer system;data-mining;dynamically changing environment;information systems;machine learning techniques;security experts knowledge;security layer;system operators","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Security;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","14","2","28","","","April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These trends can make control systems vulnerable to cyber attack, which in the case of control systems may impact physical processes causing environmental harm or injury. We present some results of the DATES (Detection and Analysis of Threats to the Energy Sector) project, wherein we adapted and developed several intrusion detection technologies for control systems. The suite of detection technologies was integrated and connected to a commercial security event correlation framework from ArcSight. We demonstrated the efficacy of our detection and correlation solution on two coupled testbed environments. We particularly focused on detection, correlation, and visualization of a network traversal attack, where an attacker penetrates successive network layers to compromise critical assets that directly control the underlying process. Such an attack is of particular concern in the layered architectures typical of control system implementations.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593242","alert correlation;anomaly detection;control system security;critical infrastructure security;intrusion;security information event management","Control systems;Correlation;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Process control;Servers","security of data","DATES;commercial security event correlation framework;cyber attack;digital control systems;intrusion detection technologies;network traversal attack","","4","","22","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Factors like noise in the audit data, mobility of the nodes and the large amount of network data generated by the network make it difficult to build a normal traffic profile of the network for the purpose of anomaly detection. From this perspective, we present an anomaly detection scheme, called SCAN (stochastic clustering algorithm for network anomaly detection), that has the capability to detect intrusions with high accuracy even when audit data is not complete. We use the expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster the incoming audit data and compute the missing values in the audit data. We improve the speed of convergence of the clustering process by using Bloom filters and data summaries.

To protect these networks, intrusion detection systems are used. Signature-based intrusion detection cannot find previously unknown attacks, which is why anomaly detection is needed. However, many new systems are slow and complicated. We propose a log anomaly detection framework which aims to facilitate quick anomaly detection and also provide visualizations of the network traffic structure. The system preprocesses network logs into a numerical data matrix, reduces the dimensionality of this matrix using random projection and uses Mahalanobis distance to find outliers and calculate an anomaly score for each data point. Log lines that are too different are flagged as anomalies. The system is tested with real-world network data, and actual intrusion attempts are found. In addition, visualizations are created to represent the structure of the network data. We also perform computational time evaluation to ensure the performance is feasible. The system is fast, finds intrusion attempts and does not need clean training data.","","","","10.1109/NTMS.2014.6814006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814006","","Data mining;Data visualization;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems","digital signatures;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Mahalanobis distance;anomaly score;data point;intrusion attempts;intrusion detection systems;log lines;network data structure;network log anomaly detection system;network services;network traffic structure;numerical data matrix;random projection dimensionality reduction;real-world network data;signature-based intrusion detection","","0","","31","","","March 30 2014-April 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, our studies show that the frequency property of multiple audit event types in a sequence of events is necessary for intrusion detection. A single audit event at a given time is not sufficient for intrusion detection. Second, the ordering property of multiple audit events provides additional advantage to the frequency property for intrusion detection.

Current approaches use linear processes developed to handle single incidents with little attention paid to simultaneous or complex attacks encompassing many incidents, to coordination with other organizations, or the ability to scale to the size necessary for large, cross-cutting incidents. We have developed a coordination model for cyber incident management that provides enough structure to enable cooperative operations, but is sufficiently abstract to enable the organizational autonomy and customization essential for effective response for all types of organizations. It is easily understood, straightforward to apply, and versatile enough to overlay on existing organizational processes and structures, both for small, local activities as well as large, cross-organizational ones.

Unlike intrusions that seek to overtly disable or damage a system, it is particularly hard to detect because it uses a variety of low/slow vectors and advanced persistent threats (APTs). It is often assisted (intentionally or not) by an insider who might be an employee who downloads a trojan or uses a hardware component that has been tampered with or acquired from an unreliable source. Conventional scan and test based detection approaches work poorly, especially for hardware with embedded trojans. We describe a framework to detect potential exfiltration events that actively monitors of a set of key parameters that cover the entire stack, from hardware to the application layer. An attack alert is generated only if several monitors detect suspicious activity within a short temporal window. The cross-layer monitoring and integration helps ensure accurate alerts with fewer false positives and makes designing a successful attack more difficult.","","","","10.1109/IRI.2013.6642487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642487","","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Monitoring;Resource description framework;Sensors;Universal Serial Bus","invasive software","advanced persistent threats;application layer;attack alert;confidential data;cross-layer integration;cross-layer monitoring;data exfiltration;test based detection approaches;trojan;unauthorized leakage","","0","","28","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, broad bandwidth networks and high speed computers make the botnets to work easier. This paper aims to propose Snort intrusion detecting system to detect and prevent the malicious bots. Some rules are designed to collect the normal and abnormal packets of the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol. Then, some PHP programs are combined with Linux Netfilter/Iptables firewall to block the abnormal packets and warn system administrators.","","978-1-4244-7639-8","","10.1109/COMPSYM.2010.5685534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5685534","Botnet;Firewall;Intrusion detection and prevention;Malware","Computer hacking;Computers;Internet;Intrusion detection;Linux;Protocols;Servers","Internet;Linux;authorisation;computer network security;invasive software;protocols","Internet relay chat protocol;Iptables firewall;Linux Netfilter;PHP program;Snort intrusion detection system;botnet detection;broad bandwidth network;high speed computer;malicious bot prevention;malware;social engineering;user computer;warn system administrator","","0","","17","","","16-18 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Selecting appropriate network features is one of the factors that influence the accuracy of SDC model. Past research has shown that the Hidden Marcov Chain, Genetic Algorithm, and the two-second time windows are among the best features selection methods for SDC Model. However this paper aims to improve the accuracy model by applying the features extraction based customized features. The customized features are the network data set which has been preprocessed through the following steps: removing biased attributes, discretized using chi-merge and remove the attributes with string value. The previous research applies the feature extraction based on all features. The best model is measured based on the detection rate, false alarm rate and number of rules using four data mining techniques such as Ripper(Jrip), Ridor, PART and decision three. The experiment is conducted using three random KDD-cup99 data sets. The result shows that the features extraction based on customized features has increased the accuracy model between 0.4% to 9% detection rates and reduced between 0.17% to 0.5% false alarm rates. The result shows the importance of data preprocessing in producing a high quality SDC Model.","","978-1-4244-8134-7","","10.1109/ISDA.2010.5687051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5687051","Data Mining;Features Selection;Genetic algorithm feature selection;JRip algorithm;Signature Detection","","data mining;decision trees;digital signatures;feature extraction;pattern classification;security of data","KDD-cup99 data sets;PART;Ridor;Ripper(Jrip);biased attribute removal;customized features;data mining;data preprocessing;decision three;detection rate;false alarm rate;features extraction;features selection;intrusion detection system;network security;security audit data set;signature detection classification model","","2","","18","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Counterfeiting in supply chain management is an attack with cloned and fraud RFID tags in order to gain illegal benefits. In this paper we will extend our previous work on a trust framework and construct a computational model for the trust management. The trust evaluation is built into the process of transactions of the data exchange and authorization in order to facilitate a better data sharing and access control.

The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models.

Different from existing solutions, CARE does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes a fundamentally general approach-it achieves resilience against a wide range of routing disruption Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks by treating them and ""dysfunctional"" network events in the same way. Here, dysfunctional network events denote link and routing failures caused by link contention or node mobility. CARE is a cross-layer scheme that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to them at the network layer. Because dysfunctional network events and routing disruption attacks have a pronounced effect on the size of the TCP congestion window, monitoring the window size is an effective method of detecting such events. Using this method, CARE is able to detect attacks. Once an attack is detected, CARE initiates a re-routing process to find a new route. For this purpose, a re-routing algorithm is proposed that circumvents the nodes that are likely to be misbehaving. Analysis and simulation results show that the CARE architecture is effective in thwarting a number of insider and protocol-compliant attacks. Our results indicate that CARE is also effective in improving network throughput in non-hostile environments because its proactive re-routing mechanism aids in maintaining a reasonable level of throughput when dysfunctional network events occur.","1095-2055","1-4244-0572-6","","10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067617","","Authentication;Computer crime;Cryptography;Femtocell networks;Information security;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Resilience;Routing;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication network routing","attack-resilient routing architecture;cross-layer active RE-routing;denial-of-service resilience;link failures;mobile ad hoc networks;node mobility;protocol-compliant attacks;routing failures","","0","","12","","","9-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Another advantage is the reduced network size. We use the classification capability of the K-Map on selected dimensions of data set in detecting anomalies. Randomly selected subsets that contain both attacks and normal records from the KDD Cup 1999 benchmark data are used to train the hierarchical net. We use a confidence measure to label the clusters. Then we use the test set from the same KDD Cup 1999 benchmark to test the hierarchical net.

Regular expression matching, despite its flexibility and efficiency in attack identification, brings significantly high computation and storage complexities to NIDSes, making line-rate packet processing a challenging task. In this paper, we present stride finite automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family, to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching. Different from conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, a StriFA only needs to scan a partial traffic stream to find suspicious information. The presented StriFA technique has been implemented in software and evaluated based on different traces. The simulation results show that the StriFA acceleration scheme offers an increased speed over traditional nondeterministic finite automaton/deterministic finite automaton, while at the same time reducing the memory requirement.","1932-8184","","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2244791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475958","Deep packet inspection (DPI);deterministic finite automaton (DFA);network intrusion detection systems (NIDSes);nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)","Acceleration;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Educational institutions;Engines;Memory management;Pattern matching","finite automata;security of data;string matching","NIDS;StriFA acceleration scheme;attack database;attack identification;data stream;high-speed regular expression matching;line-rate packet processing;malicious information;network intrusion detection systems;stride finite automata;string matching;traffic stream","","2","","31","","2013-03-07","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although central control is the major advantage of SDN, it is also a single point of failure if it is made unreachable by a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack. To mitigate this threat, this paper proposes to use the central control of SDN for attack detection and introduces a solution that is effective and lightweight in terms of the resources that it uses. More precisely, this paper shows how DDoS attacks can exhaust controller resources and provides a solution to detect such attacks based on the entropy variation of the destination IP address. This method is able to detect DDoS within the first five hundred packets of the attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2015.7069319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069319","Controller;DDoS attack;Entropy;SDN","Computer architecture;Computer crime;Control systems;Entropy;IP networks;Monitoring;Process control","IP networks;computer network security;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attacks;Distributed Denial Of Service attack;IP address destination;SDN controllers;attack detection;attack traffic;central control;entropy variation;exhaust controller resources;network architecture;software defined network","","0","","15","","","16-19 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A class of IDSs is based on clustering of network traffic into normal and abnormal according to some features of the connections. The selected distance function to measure the similarity and dissimilarity of sessions' features affect the performance of clustering based IDSs. The most popular distance metric, which is used in designing these IDSs is the Euclidean distance function. In this paper, we argue that more appropriate distance functions can be deployed for IDSs. We propose a method of learning an appropriate distance function according to a set of supervision information. This metric is derived by solving a semi-definite optimization problem, which attempts to decrease the distance between the similar, and increases the distances between the dissimilar feature vectors. The evaluation of this scheme over Kyoto2006+ dataset shows that the new distance metric, can improve the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) clustering based IDS in terms of normal detection and false positive rates.","","978-1-4799-8817-4","","10.1109/AISP.2015.7123497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7123497","Anomaly detection;Clustering Algorithms;Intrusion detection system;Metric learning","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Feature extraction;Measurement;Support vector machines;Training data","mathematical programming;pattern clustering;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","Euclidean distance function;Kyoto2006+ dataset;SVM clustering;SVM-clustering based intrusion detection system;clustering based IDS;dissimilar feature vector;distance metric;false positive rate;network security;network traffic;normal detection;semidefinite optimization problem;support vector machine clustering","","0","","14","","","3-5 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first develop a model to describe the changes in the received signal strength of a wireless station during a session hijack, while the received signal is embedded in colored noise caused by fading wireless channels. An optimal filter is then designed for the purpose of detection. We show that using a Wavelet Transform (WT), the colored noise with complex Power Spectral Density (PSD) in our case can be approximately whitened. Since a larger Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) increases the detection rate and decreases the false alarm rate, the SNR is maximized by analyzing the signal at specific frequency ranges. The detection mechanism is validated using both simulation and experimental results. The detector is shown to be reliable, computationally inexpensive and have minimal impact on the network performance.","1536-1276","","","10.1109/TWC.2010.04.081447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5441359","Network security, intrusion detection.","Colored noise;Computational modeling;Fading;Filters;Frequency;Signal analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms;Wireless networks","safety systems;telecommunication security;time series;wavelet transforms;wireless channels","fading wireless channels;optimal filter;power spectral density;received signal strength;session hijacks;wavelet based analysis;wavelet transform;wireless networks","","1","","13","","","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
