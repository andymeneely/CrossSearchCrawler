In this paper, we consider the arbitrary sized sensor networks and propose algorithms to improve the detection rates by intelligently enabling the intrusion detection functionality on particular sensor nodes. The proposed algorithms, based on the concepts of minimum cut-set and minimum dominating set, allow for a distributed implementation.

How to choose the effective and key features is very important topic for an intrusion detection problem. Support vector machine (SVM) has been employed to provide potential solutions for the IDSs problem. However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization method, which is not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, the proposed ABC-SVM model is applied to determine free parameters of SVM and feature selection at building intrusion detection system. The standard ABC is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine and the binary ABC is to obtain the optimum feature selection for IDSs from KDD Cup 99 data set.

In this work, we propose an autonomous host-based intrusion detection system for detecting malicious sinking behavior. The proposed detection system maximizes the detection accuracy by using cross-layer features to define a routing behavior. For learning and adaptation to new attack scenarios and network environments, two machine learning techniques are utilized. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are used together to exploit the better accuracy of SVM and faster speed of FDA. Instead of using all cross-layer features, features from MAC layer are associated/correlated with features from other layers, thereby reducing the feature set without reducing the information content. Various experiments are conducted with varying network conditions and malicious node behavior. The effects of factors such as mobility, traffic density, and the packet drop ratios of the malicious nodes are analyzed. Experiments based on simulation show that the proposed cross-layer approach aided by a combination of SVM and FDA performs significantly better than other existing approaches.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374416","Cross-layer design;ad hoc networks;intrusion detection;routing attacks;sinking.","","ad hoc networks;radio networks;support vector machines;telecommunication security","Fisher discriminant analysis;MAC layer;autonomous host-based intrusion detection;cross-layer detection;malicious node behavior;malicious sinking behavior;packet drop ratio;security vulnerabilities;support vector machines;traffic density;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","28","","2010-01-08","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The need for new countermeasures is clear and urgent as cyber-attacks are more than ever capable of causing loss of human life; destroying the environment, and causing a high level of disruption to critical infrastructures. The impact of cyber-attacks is sometimes comparable to the impact of traditional military actions. However, the lack of understanding of the scope of attacks and how they operate could lead to unsuccessful protection mechanisms. We have analysed attacks targeting IT and business network, and Critical infrastructure, as a result we present four levels of visibility of attacks that need to be considered when designing or implementing security mechanisms. In our discussion of these four levels of visibility of attacks, we particularly focus on one level where malicious users actions are direct threats to the targeted system but yet not visible by the targeted systems.

Especially in the virtual private network (VPN) topology, with the emergence of the tunneling, private routing and cipher technology in VPN, there are two embarrassments for the protection of the entire VPN topology. One is that internal services will be uncovered in the Internet by the tunneling, which can be compromised by attacking the client-side endpoint of a VPN tunnel. The other is that firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) could not completely analyze the network packet content because of the private routing and cipher technology. Based on the analysis of the VPN topology, we put forward the multi-layered correlative control (MLCC) mechanism. MLCC is a multi-layered security protection mechanism based on VPN gateway incorporating client end-point, firewall, IDS and internal services. There are three types of correlative technology introduced in MLCC, which are endpoint extending, component correlation and service engine. By their combination, MLCC can turn the VPN protection into a correlative and full model and improve the security of the VPN topology.

One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).","1550-6002","978-1-4244-8078-4","978-0-7695-4131-0","10.1109/QSIC.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562949","Intrusion Detection System;automation;black-box testing;logical expression","Accuracy;Adaptation model;Engines;Payloads;Protocols;Software testing","computer network security;program testing","IDS;computer network protection;intrusion detection engines;logical expression testing criteria;malicious behaviour;network traffic monitoring;specification based testing","","3","","21","","","14-15 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses the using of SSD approach and potential applications in other emerging field by introduce the using of SSD concepts in backdoor attack detection field. This research shows that by using SSD to detect backdoor attack can be gained very low false negative and false positive rates and reduces the scan process time detection.","","978-1-4673-5255-0","","10.1109/ICoIA.2013.6650235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650235","RTT;Stepping stone;backdoor;stepping stone detection","Internet;Intrusion detection;Malware;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security","SSD approach;backdoor attack detection field;false negative rates;false positive rates;network intrusion tracking;scan process time detection;stepping stone detection approach","","0","","23","","","23-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, constructing and maintaining a misuse detection system is very labor-intensive since attack scenarios and patterns need to be analyzed and categorized, and the corresponding rules and patterns need to be carefully hand-coded. Thus, data mining can be used to ease this inconvenience. This paper proposes a multiple-level hybrid classifier, an intrusion detection system that uses a combination of tree classifiers and clustering algorithms to detect intrusions. Performance of this new algorithm is compared to other popular approaches such as MADAM ID and 3-level tree classifiers, and significant improvement has been achieved from the viewpoint of both high intrusion detection rate and reasonably low false alarm rate","","0-7803-9517-4","","10.1109/MLSP.2005.1532885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532885","","Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Testing","computer networks;data mining;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;trees (mathematics)","MADAM ID;data mining;intrusion detection system;misuse detection system;multiple-level hybrid classifier;network attack patterns;network security;networked computers;pattern categorization;pattern clustering;tree classifiers","","4","","8","","","28-28 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes can either compete or cooperate with each other to access the channel(s) so that either an individual or a group objective can be achieved. Game theory, which is a mathematical tool developed to understand the interaction among rational entities, can be applied to model and to analyze individual or group behaviour of nodes for multiple access in wireless networks. Game theory also enables us to model the selfish/malicious behaviour of nodes, and subsequently design the punishment or defense mechanisms for robust multiple access in wireless networks. In addition, game models can provide distributed solutions to the multiple access problems, which are based on solid theoretical foundations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the game models (e.g., noncooperative/cooperative, static/dynamic, and complete/incomplete information) developed for different multiple access schemes (i.e., contention-free and contention-based random channel access) in wireless networks. We consider time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), and code-division multiple access (CDMA), ALOHA, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based wireless networks. In addition, game models for multiple access in dynamic spectrum access-based cognitive radio networks are reviewed. The major findings from the game models used for these different access schemes are highlighted.

In the proposed algorithm, a normal profile is constructed from normal mobility patterns of mobile nodes in mobile wireless networks. From the constructed normal profile, the dissimilarity is computed by a weighted dissimilarity measure. If the computed dissimilarity value is greater than the dissimilarity threshold that is a system parameter, an alert message is occurred. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation. From the result of the simulation, we know that the proposed method is superior to the performance of anomaly detection methods using other dissimilarity measures.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283011","Anomaly Detection;Dissimilarity Measures;Mobile Wireless Networks;Mobility Pattern","Authentication;Cellular networks;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Pollution measurement;Weight measurement;Wireless networks","mobile radio;telecommunication security","mobile wireless network;mobility pattern;network identity theft;network intrusion;weighted-dissimilarity-based anomaly detection","","0","","8","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel security system has been proposed to address the overall security requirement for Wireless Sensor Networks.

Currently, authentication mechanisms are the only barrier to prevent those attacks. Traditional password-based authentication is efficient (especially from the user point of view), but not effective -- the lack of continuous verification is a severe access control vulnerability. To overcome this issue, continuous identity monitoring is needed, operating in similar fashion to that of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, traditional host-based IDSs are system-centric -- they monitor system events but fail on flagging malicious activity from intruders with access to the legitimate user's credentials. Therefore, extending the IDS concept to the user authentication level appears as a promising security control. The need to distinguish human users (user-centric anomaly-based detection) leads to the use of biometric features.

Meta-alerts may then be the basis for reporting to security experts or for communication within a distributed intrusion detection system. We propose a novel technique for online alert aggregation which is based on a dynamic, probabilistic model of the current attack situation. Basically, it can be regarded as a data stream version of a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the model parameters. With three benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve reduction rates of up to 99.96 percent while the number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low.

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","","978-1-4244-0973-0","978-1-4244-0973-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A harder problem to crack in the field of Network Security is the identification and prevention of attacks. An effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for ensuring network security. Intrusion detection systems include pattern analysis techniques to discover useful patterns of system features. These patterns describe user behavior. Anomalies are computed using the set of relevant system features. The derived patterns comprise inputs of classification systems, which are based on statistical and machine learning pattern recognition techniques. Clustering methods are useful in detection of unknown attack patterns. Elimination of insignificant features is essential for a simplified, faster and more accurate detection of attacks.

IPSs protect information systems from unauthorized access, damage or disruption. They are installed on network primary point and perform deep packet inspection (6 layers) so the hardware should be fast enough to sit almost invisibly within the network. This policy requires expensive hardware which is based on multiple server processor technology. It also needs appropriate changes in network design and policies. The cost may not be so reasonable for medium and small size companies. In this paper we are going to implement some kind of integration between signature-based NIDS and packet filtering firewalls which would increase the overall security by a reasonable cost in compare with modern IPSs. We try to conclude this by optimizing snort as a famous open source NIDS with a sample firewall program in Linux which is implemented by means of IPTABLES commands.

Because WSNs in general and in nature are unattended and physically reachable from the outside world, they could be vulnerable to physical attacks in the form of node capture or node destruction. These forms of attacks are hard to protect against and require intelligent prevention methods. It is necessary for WSNs to have security measures in place as to prevent an intruder from inserting compromised nodes in order to decimate or disturb the network performance. In this paper we present an intrusion detection algorithm for wireless sensor networks which does not require prior knowledge of network behavior or a learning period in order to establish this knowledge. We have taken a more practical approach and constructed this algorithm with small to middle-size networks in mind, like home or office networks. The proposed algorithm is also dynamic in nature as to cope with new and unknown attack types. This algorithm is intended to protect the network and ensure reliable and accurate aggregated sensor readings.

Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques such as SOM (self-organizing map) are more appropriate for an auto-mated network management such as configuration, performance and anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose an auto-mated network management based on hierarchical SOM that groups similar data and visualize their clusters.

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack.

The classifier has two distinct characteristics: one is that it regards each data point in the feature space with the limited influence scope, which is served as the decisive bounds of the classifier, and the other is that it has the ""default"" label to recognize those novel attacks. We present a novel classification algorithm, influence-based classification algorithm, to deal with ambiguous data. Our system is tested on the KDD Cup 1999 data. Results show that it is superior to other data mining based approaches in detection performance, especially in detection of PROBE and U2R attacks","","1-4244-0605-6","1-4244-0605-6","10.1109/ICCIAS.2006.294204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4072157","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Signal processing algorithms;Space technology;Training data","pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security","anomalous network traffic behavior;data clustering;data mining based;influence-based classification algorithm;known-attack profile;network anomaly detection;network connection;protocols","","2","","10","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study aims to optimize threshold parameters, the size of which increases with the number of traffic sequence. Different values of network traffic sequence were generated and simulated by the NS2 tool. Based on these values, the detection rates of the CUSUM algorithm and multi-class CUSUM algorithms, as well as their false positive rates, are then evaluated.

As with any computer application, installation of a Trojan leaves a ldquofootprintrdquo on the systems resources. However, detection is non-trivial: the detector must be able to recognize the symptoms against a background of a range of other (ldquosaferdquo) activities, which also consume system resources. Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection). Therefore, we wished to explore the potential of an economical approach that explicitly takes into account resources used. In order to achieve our aim, we explore the possibility of making use of the existing widely deployed management information database (the MIB) as the basis for detecting attempts to install Trojan software on networked systems. We identify the characteristics of typical attacks in respect of the impact they have on particular MIB objects, and propose a decision-tree based algorithm which can detect Trojan activity.

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed.

Computing trust value for each node in the network leads to higher computational complexity. Combining trust value along with intrusion detection system can reduce the pitfalls of both methods. A comparative study of using only anomaly based intrusion detection system and combination of trust value along with an anomaly based intrusion detection system is performed. The proposed anomaly detection system uses artificial neural networks and Dempster-Shafer theory to confirm the attack occurrence in the network.","","978-1-4799-8466-4","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229722","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Adhoc Network;Security attacks;Self organizing maps;Trust computation","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing","computational complexity;inference mechanisms;mobile ad hoc networks;neural nets;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;uncertainty handling","Dempster-Shafer theory;MANET secure routing establishment;anomaly based intrusion detection system;artificial neural network;computational complexity;false positive identification;fly networking","","0","","14","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this equilibrium property will be violated by some anomalies. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-dimensional Clustering method for Short-time scale Traffic(MCST) to classify abnormal and normal traffic. We compare our new method to the well known wavelet technique. The detection result on synthetic anomaly traffic shows MCST can better detect the low-rate attacks than wavelet-based method, and detection result on real traffic demonstrates that MCST can detect more anomalies with low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4577-1668-3","","10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077018","","Data models;Educational institutions;Entropy;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;IP networks;Training","Gaussian distribution;data communication;data mining;entropy;pattern clustering;security of data;telecommunication traffic;wavelet transforms","Gaussian distribution;anomaly detection;entropy;equilibrium property;false alarm rate;feature stability;multidimensional clustering method;packet level traffic feature;short time scale traffic;statistical analysis;traffic volume;wavelet technique","","3","","26","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors. A set of simulations is conducted for validating the feasibility and evaluating the performance of our proposed framework.","1938-1883","978-1-4244-3435-0","978-1-4244-3435-0","10.1109/ICC.2009.5199233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5199233","","Autonomous agents;Communications Society;Cost function;Event detection;Humans;Impedance;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Optimization methods","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","ADRS sensor;MANET;accidental system errors;anomalous events;autonomous agent;cost-sensitive anomaly detection;decision-theoretical framework;detection accuracy;detection cost;detection performance;false positive rate;intentional attacks;key evaluation metrics;mobile ad hoc networks;operational cost;policy gradient algorithms;response cost;response system","","0","","14","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main problems of these systems, however, are the many false alarms they produce, their lack of resistance to both malicious attacks and accidental failures, and the constant appearance of new attacks and vulnerabilities. IBM Zurich Research Laboratory has developed a system that specifically targets worms rather than trying to prevent all breaches of computer security. Called Billy Goat, the specialized worm detection system runs on a dedicated machine connected to the network and detects worm-infected machines anywhere in it. Billy Goat has been proven effective at detecting worm-infected machines in a network. It is currently used in several large corporate intranets, and it is normally able to detect infected machines within seconds of their becoming infected. Furthermore, not only is it able to detect the presence of a worm in the network, it can even provide the addresses of the infected machines.

Multipattern matching is known to require intensive memory accesses and is often a performance bottleneck. Hence, specialized hardware-accelerated algorithms are required for line-speed packet processing. We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory. Furthermore, we modify this algorithm to be able to handle arbitrarily large strings at the cost of a little more on-chip memory.

In this paper, we propose a pre-processing based architecture to improve the original multi-character architecture. The design of the proposed architecture and its implementation in FPGA are described in details. Our simulation results show that the proposed architecture performs better than all the existing Brute-Force based approaches in terms of the throughput and the slice utilization.

Such an approach may miss the mark in terms of addressing the main sources of vulnerabilities, i.e., implementation bugs and misconfigurations.

Network intrusion detection systems, which are part of the layered defense scheme, must be able to meet these organizational objectives in order to be effective. Although signature based network intrusion detection systems meet several organizational security objectives, heuristic based network intrusion detection systems are able to fully meet the objectives of the organization. Through a comparative theoretical study, this paper analyzes several organizational security objectives in order to determine the network intrusion detection system that effectively meets these objectives. Through conclusive analysis of the study, heuristic based systems are better served to meet the organizational objectives than signature based systems.

In this correspondence, we propose an intrusion detection algorithm based on the AdaBoost algorithm. In the algorithm, decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features. Adaptable initial weights and a simple strategy for avoiding overfitting are adopted to improve the performance of the algorithm.

The complexity, accessibility, and openness of the Internet have served to increase the security risk of information systems tremendously. Intrusions pose a serious security risk in a network environment. The normal and the abnormal behaviors in networked computers are hard to predict, as the boundaries cannot be well defined. This prediction process usually generates false alarms in many anomaly based intrusion detection systems. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced, where a set of fuzzy rules is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network, and a fuzzy inference engine can be applied over such rules to determine intrusions. This paper proposes a technique with genetic algorithm to generate fuzzy rules instead of manual design that are able to detect anomalies and some specific intrusions. Experiments were performed with DARPA data sets, during normal behavior and intrusive behavior. This paper presents some results and reports the performance of generated fuzzy rules in classifying different types of intrusions.","","978-1-4244-8622-9","","10.1109/ITAIC.2011.6030165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030165","fuzzy classification;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection","Accuracy;Biological cells;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Training","Internet;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;security of data","DARPA data sets;Internet;anomaly based intrusion detection system;computer network;evolving fuzzy classifiers;false alarm rate;fuzzy inference engine;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rules;genetic algorithm;information security;information system;intrusive activity;intrusive behavior;network environment;prediction process;security risk","","1","","7","","","20-22 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although numerous network security tools have been developed, yet the fast growth of intrusive activities is still a serious issue. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to detect intrusive activities on the network. Machine learning and classification algorithms help to design “Intrusion Detection Models” which can classify the network traffic into intrusive or normal traffic. In this paper we present the comparative performance of NSL-KDD based data set compatible classification algorithms. These classifiers have been evaluated in WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) environment using 41 attributes. Around 94,000 instances from complete KDD dataset have been included in the training data set and over 48,000 instances have been included in the testing data set.

Security vulnerabilities of 802.11 wireless networks are investigated, leading to a summary of network traffic metrics relevant to modeling the security of wireless networks. The proposed approach utilizes a simple distance-based heuristic measure to label clusters as either normal or intrusive. The classification of network traffic instances is further enhanced with the aid of tracers, i.e., a small set of instances with known labels - normal or intrusive.
