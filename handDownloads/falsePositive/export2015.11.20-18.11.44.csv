SecureComm 2005. First International Conference on","20060320","2005","","","231","233","Buffer overflows constitute by far the most frequently encountered class of attacks against computer systems. In this paper we introduce a tool, termed bufSTAT that achieves a low probability of false alarm and issues early attack warnings. BufSTAT relies on Finite State Machines (FSM) for attack modeling and can detect every stage of an ongoing attack and can thus prevent its execution by issuing early warning in a progressive manner. It can also detect sophisticated multi-stage attacks that are executed over long periods of time. A significant attribute of our approach is that it is amenable to detecting unknown attacks as well after appropriate modification of bufSTAT.","","0-7695-2369-2","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607577","","Automata;Buffer overflow;Computer networks;Computer security;Delay;Educational institutions;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Time factors","","","","0","","5","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, a bifurcation appears when time delay t passes a constant value which means that the worm propagation system is unstable and uncontrollable. Thus, the time delay should be decreased in order to predict or eliminate the worm propagation.

This IDS enables nodes to detect whether their next node on a path flow forwards correctly packets or not by overhearing its transmissions. However, as Watchdog does not consider the packet loss ratio, it can lead to false positives. Indeed, a node can accuse another node of misbehaving whereas in reality it suffers from link loss. In order to overcome this issue, we propose an extension scheme to the Watchdog IDS which enables a node to determine whether it does not overhear its next node due to packet loss issue or due to misbehavior. To reach this goal, we assume that malicious nodes drop both acknowledgements and forwarded packets with different frequencies. Thus, our scheme compares the distribution of a node's acknowledgment with its distribution of forwarded packets of data to detect misbehaving nodes. Furthermore, we extend our scheme so that it enables a node to monitor both its next node and its previous node on a flow path.","","978-1-4673-6425-6","","10.1109/ICTEL.2013.6632124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632124","","Mobile computing;Multiaccess communication;Packet loss;Random variables;Vectors;Wireless mesh networks","security of data;trusted computing;wireless mesh networks","Watchdog IDS;Watchdog extension;intrusion detection system;link loss;malicious nodes;packet loss;reputation system;trust system;wireless mesh network","","1","","11","","","6-8 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The huge amount of logs generated by different assets in the network are not always capable to be correlated and reviewed to determine possible security breaches. We implemented a new reliable and scalable classification-based hybrid IPS that can easily manage the processing of all the authentication log information of different IPSs in the network. This enhanced framework can determine in a more precise manner if a communication can be considered legitimate or an intrusion. This classification method increases the intrusion detection rate and decreases the false positive rate.

The method constructs a homogeneous Markov chain model to characterize the normal behavior of a privileged program, and associates the states of the Markov chain with the unique system calls in the training data. At the detection stage, the probabilities that the Markov chain model supports the system call sequences generated by the program are computed. A low probability indicates an anomalous sequence that may result from intrusive activities. Then a decision rule based on the number of anomalous sequences in a locality frame is adopted to classify the program's behavior. The method gives attention to both computational efficiency and detection accuracy, and is especially suitable for on-line detection.

Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this background, this paper proposes a third alternative that hybrids misuse and anomaly prevention. In this way, ESIDE-Depian uses a Bayesian network to learn from both anomaly and misuse knowledge in order to be able to detect either kind of attacks, known and unknown.

Thus, there is no guarantee that a routed communication path is free of malicious nodes that will not comply with the employed protocol and attempt to interfere the network operations. In this paper, we survey the problem of secure routing in ad hoc wireless networks, and discuss the related techniques of cryptographic key distribution. However, no matter how secure the routing protocol is, it is still possible that some nodes are compromised and become malicious. The presence of compromised nodes, especially in nodes that are communication bottlenecks, limit the effectiveness of the described secure routing protocols. We therefore consider the problem of intrusion detection for such nodes. The intrusion detection problem and some solutions are described in detail for a concrete queueing model of medium access. The extensions of the solutions to address the problem in more general scenarios are also discussed.","","0-7803-8140-8","","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290203","","Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Computer science;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","access protocols;ad hoc networks;cryptography;queueing theory;routing protocols;telecommunication security","compromised nodes;concrete queueing model;cryptographic key distribution;intrusion detection problem;medium access;secure routing protocols;wireless ad hoc networks","","6","","26","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positiv- s of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365643","Virtual machine;malware behavior;malware detection;virtual machine commitment","Joints;Labeling;Malware;Monitoring;Object recognition;Software;Virtual machining","invasive software;operating systems (computers);software performance evaluation;state estimation;virtual machines","OS-level VM;OS-level information flow;OS-level virtual machines;Secom;VM commitment system;Windows-based OS-level virtualization system;automatic malicious state estimation;benign cluster committing;benign cluster distinguish;commercial anti malware tools;false-positive rate reduction;feather-weight virtual machine system;intrusion detection-and-recovery systems;log data volume;malicious change recognition;malicious cluster distinguish;malicious object identification;malicious state change elimination;malware behavior information;malware clearance;malware detection methods;performance degradation;performance overhead;secure commitment;state change grouping","","1","","39","","2012-11-30","March-April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Then we present a lightweight anomaly detection scheme (ADS) in WSNs. In the ADS, no more cooperation between sensor nodes is required, which dramatically decrease the energy consumption. Another key advantage of our approach is that GEP-ADS could solve the problem that the traditional time series methods can't make an accurate prediction without the pre-knowledge. In order to evaluate our ADS, we have simulated several routing attacks, and fully discussed the parameter setting influence on our ADS.

CPINDEX installs appropriate cyber-side instrumentation probes on individual host systems to dynamically capture and profile low-level system activities such as interprocess communications among operating system assets. CPINDEX uses the generated logs along with the topological information about the power network configuration to build stochastic Bayesian network models of the whole cyber-physical infrastructure and update them dynamically based on the current state of the underlying power system. Finally, CPINDEX implements belief propagation algorithms on the created stochastic models combined with a novel graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm to calculate the cyber-physical index, i.e., to measure the security-level of the system's current cyber-physical state. The results of our experiments with actual attacks against a real-world power control network shows that CPINDEX, within few seconds, can efficiently compute the numerical indices during the attack that indicate the progressing malicious attack correctly.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2014.2372315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6979242","Cyber-physical security metrics;cyber-physical systems;intrusion detection systems;situational awareness","Generators;Indexes;Power measurement;Security;Smart grids","Bayes methods;graph theory;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system security;risk management;stochastic processes","CPIndex;cyber-physical critical infrastructures;cyber-physical security indices;cyber-physical vulnerability assessment;cyber-side instrumentation probes;graph-theoretic power system indexing algorithm;interprocess communications;numerical indices;operating system assets;power network configuration;power operators;power-grid Infrastructures;power-grid control networks;security assessment techniques;security-oriented stochastic risk management technique;stochastic Bayesian network models","","1","","20","","2014-12-08","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It combines two significant elements: (1) an efficient flow management scheme using on-chip BRAMs for storing the flow table, and (2) a parallel and pipelined classification engine array with partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR) on FPGA. We have implemented and evaluated RocketTC on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA based platform. Our results show a sustained throughput of over 20 Gbps for minimum packet size of 40 bytes, and high accuracy above 97% for classifying nearly a hundred popular applications. Additionally, it is easy for RocketTC to update more application types.","","978-1-4673-0008-7","978-1-4673-0723-9","10.1109/ICCNC.2012.6167454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6167454","","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Payloads;Pipelines;Throughput","computer architecture;field programmable gate arrays;microprocessor chips;telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","FPGA-based architecture;RocketTC;Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA based platform;flow management scheme;flow table;high throughput traffic classification architecture;high-speed networks;network management;network security;on-chip BRAMs;parallel classification engine array;partial dynamic reconfiguration;pipelined classification engine array;software-based solutions;traffic classification acceleration;traffic engineering","","0","","18","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many real-world applications such as intrusion or credit card fraud detection require an effective and efficient framework to identify deviated data instances. However, most anomaly detection methods are typically implemented in batch mode, and thus cannot be easily extended to large-scale problems without sacrificing computation and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose an online oversampling principal component analysis (osPCA) algorithm to address this problem, and we aim at detecting the presence of outliers from a large amount of data via an online updating technique. Unlike prior principal component analysis (PCA)-based approaches, we do not store the entire data matrix or covariance matrix, and thus our approach is especially of interest in online or large-scale problems. By oversampling the target instance and extracting the principal direction of the data, the proposed osPCA allows us to determine the anomaly of the target instance according to the variation of the resulting dominant eigenvector. Since our osPCA need not perform eigen analysis explicitly, the proposed framework is favored for online applications which have computation or memory limitations. Compared with the well-known power method for PCA and other popular anomaly detection algorithms, our experimental results verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6200273","Anomaly detection;least squares;online updating;oversampling;principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Data models;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Memory management;Principal component analysis","","","","4","","26","","2012-05-15","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Firewalls provide a false sense of security because they have inherent flaws that are continuously exploited by hackers. Current firewalls lack in providing adequate security against insiders. Literature suggests that these limitations arise from the deficiencies in firewall design. This paper presents a model of a firewall called disarming firewall. The model is composed of different components, each serving different purpose. The firewall protects against malicious insiders by limiting the attacking capabilities of each internal host. Knowing that obtaining knowledge of end systems is a precursor of an attack, the firewall hides the identity of OS and server software placed in DMZ from internal as well as external users. Another problem solved by the firewall is the general laziness in applying patches to the software. The auditing system of firewall actively monitors all systems in the perimeter and applies patches as soon as they are released.","","978-1-4244-8001-2","","10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625739","Disarmed Host;Firewall;Network Security","Authentication;Fires;Internet;Monitoring;Servers;Software","authorisation;computer crime;operating systems (computers)","auditing system;disarming firewall;hackers;network security;operating system;server software","","0","","22","","","14-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder.

To avoid the blind use of GP shown in previous research, we guide the search by means of a fitness function based on recent advances on IDS evaluation. For the experimental work we use a well-known dataset (i.e. KDD-99) that has become a standard to compare research although its drawbacks.

We focus on the anomalous behavioral characteristics between attack and victim when they undergo sequences of compromising actions and that are inherent to the classes of vulnerability-exploit attacks. A new approach, Gestalt, is proposed to statefully capture and monitor activities between hosts and progressively assess possible network anomalies by multilevel behavior tracking, cross-level triggering and correlation, and a probabilistic inference model is proposed for intrusion assessment and detection. Such multilevel design provides a collective perspective to reveal more anomalies than individual levels.

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","2","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the improvements of audio steganography, disclosure of information becomes possible for a lot of applications.

Novelty detection, the ability to identify new or previously unknown situations, is a useful ability for learning systems, especially when dealing with data streams, where concepts may appear, disappear, or evolve overtime. There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime. We propose a new methodology to associate the novelty patterns detected by the algorithm, in an unsupervised fashion, with the true classes. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology through the use of known novelty detection algorithms with artificial and real data sets.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2441713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118190","Evaluation methodologies;data streams;evaluation methodology;novelty detection","Context;Data mining;Decision support systems;Electronic mail;Mathematical model;Measurement uncertainty;Time measurement","data mining;matrix algebra;unsupervised learning","artificial data sets;confusion matrix;data stream mining;evaluation measures;evaluation methodology;knowledge extraction;learning systems;multiclass novelty detection algorithms;nonstationary distribution;novelty patterns;real data sets;true classes;unsupervised learning","","0","","47","","2015-06-04","Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among the various network security measures, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role to integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources. It seems that the presence of uncertainty and the imprecise nature of the intrusions make fuzzy systems suitable for such systems. Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks. This paper evaluates performance of ANFIS in the forms of binary and multi-classifier to categorize activities of a system into normal and suspicious or intrusive activities. Experiments for evaluation of the classifiers were performed with the KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. The Overall Results show that ANFIS can be effective in detecting various intrusions.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276608","ANFIS;Computer network Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;Neuro-Fuzzy classifier","Availability;Communication system security;Computer networks;Computer security;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Learning;Protocols","fuzzy set theory;security of data","KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer networks;network intrusion detection;neurofuzzy classification","","1","","17","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This novel approach combines both detection and response strategies involving both real-time analysis and effective statistical analysis of attack and normal traffic. The novel strategy involves a hybrid statistical approach involving Bayesian and Discriminant Analysis Classification. This comprises discriminant analysis of the normal and attack traffic after using Bayes Theorem to evaluate the training data. The results of the statistical analysis is fed into the IDS to reduce misclassification of false positives and distinguish between attacks and false positives in the IDS alert monitor.

The first one aims to generate meta-alerts through clustering and the second one aims to reduce the rate of false alarms using a binary classification of the generated meta-alerts. For the first stage we use two alternatives, self-organizing map (SOM) with k-means algorithm and neural GAS with fuzzy c-means algorithm. For the second stage we use three approaches, SOM with K-means algorithm, support vector machine and decision trees.

The problem with such a system is that it cannot detect novel attacks whose signature is not available and hence generates a high rate of alerts. In this paper Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Back-Propagation algorithm is used to classify attacks. We train and test MLP with KDD99 training dataset. We use KDD99 dataset which is a subset of the DARPA dataset. It is a preprocessed dataset and is most suitable for our system. We analyze the working of MLP by performing various experiments. We observed that MLP Neural network requires large training time.

The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless features leads to a simplified problem and enhance detection rate. By combining different selected features that will be evaluated, where this will lead us to determine suitable combination features to attain best results. In ESSGBML, Zeroth Level Classifier System (ZCS) plays the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether it is normal or intrusion.

Digital forensic analysis of intrusions using alerts generated by existing intrusion detection system (IDS) faces major challenges, especially for IDS deployed in large networks. In this paper, the concept of automatically sifting through a huge volume of alerts to distinguish the different stages of a DDoS attack is developed. The proposed novel framework is purpose-built to analyze multiple logs from the network for proactive forecast and timely detection of DDoS attacks, through a combined approach of Shannon-entropy concept and clustering algorithm of relevant feature variables. Experimental studies on a cyber-range simulation dataset from the project industrial partners show that the technique is able to distinguish precursor alerts for DDoS attacks, as well as the attack itself with a very low false positive rate (FPR) of 22.5%. Application of this technique greatly assists security experts in network analysis to combat DDoS attacks.","","","","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116055","Shannon entropy;alert management;distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) detection;k-means clustering analysis;network security;online anomaly detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Entropy;Feature extraction;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;digital forensics;entropy;forecasting theory;pattern clustering","DDoS attacks;FPR;IDS;Shannon-entropy concept;clustering algorithm;cyber-range simulation dataset;digital forensic analysis;distributed denial-of-service;entropy clustering approach;false positive rate;forecasting;intrusion detection system;network analysis;proactive forecast;project industrial partner;volume anomaly","","0","","32","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most background modeling methods fail in the presence of intensity changes, because the model cannot handle sudden changes. A solution to this problem is to use intensity-robust features. Despite the changes of an edge's shape and position among frames, edges are less sensitive than a pixel's intensity to illumination changes. Furthermore, background models in the presence of moving objects produce ghosts in the detected output, because high quality models require ideal backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a robust statistical edge-segment-based method for background modeling of non-ideal sequences. The proposed method learns the structure of the scene using the edges' behaviors through the use of kernel-density distributions. Moreover, it uses segment features to overcome the shape and position variations of the edges. Hence, the use of segments gives us local information of the scene, and that helps us to predict the objects and background precisely. Furthermore, we accumulate segments to build edge distributions, which allow us to perform unconstrained training and to overcome the ghost effect. In addition, the proposed method uses adaptive thresholding (in the segments) to detect the moving objects. Therefore, this approach increases the accuracy over previous methods, which use fixed thresholds.","1051-8215","","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2242551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423877","Background modeling;edge-segments;motion detection;object detection","Adaptation models;Image edge detection;Integrated circuit modeling;Kernel;Lighting;Robustness;Shape","edge detection;image segmentation;image sequences","background dynamism;background modeling;intensity changes;kernel-density distributions;nonideal sequences;statistical edge-segment distributions","","4","","33","","2013-01-30","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Rule extraction methods create interpretable rule sets that act as classifiers. They have mostly been combined with already labeled data sets. This paper aims to combine unsupervised anomaly detection with rule extraction techniques to create an online anomaly detection framework. Unsupervised anomaly detection uses diffusion maps and clustering for labeling an unknown data set. Rule sets are created using conjunctive rule extraction algorithm.

Most of existing solutions are prevent DoS attacks after an intruder sending forged frame by spoofing Client or AP's identity. Few solutions are exists to detect an attacker at the time of MAC address spoofing. None of these techniques provides a complete solution.

As the importance of cyber-physical system (CPS) security is growing, various intrusion detection algorithms to protect SCADA system and generation sector have been suggested, whereas there were less consideration on distribution sector. Thus, this paper first highlights the significance of CPS security, especially the availability as the most important factor in smart grid environment. Then this paper classifies various modern intrusion detection system (IDS) techniques for securing smart grid network. In our approach, we propose a novel behavior-based IDS for IEC 61850 protocol using both statistical analysis of traditional network features and specification-based metrics. Finally, we present the attack scenarios and detection methods applicable for IEC 61850-based digital substation in Korean environment.","","","","10.1109/PTC.2015.7232339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232339","Cyber-physical system;IEC 61850;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;smart grid","Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Inductors;Measurement;Security","IEC standards;SCADA systems;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids;statistical analysis;substation protection","CPS security;IEC 61850 protocol;Korean environment;SCADA system protection;behavior-based IDS;behavior-based intrusion detection technique;cyber physical system security;digital substation;electricity infrastructure physical environment;fully automated electricity network reliability;smart grid infrastructure;statistical analysis","","0","","13","","","June 29 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper shows a spam host detection approach that uses support vector machines(SVM) for classification. We create a parallel version of standard Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) to determine free parameters of the SVM classifier and apply our proposed model to a content web spamming dataset, WEBSPAM-UK2011. Our implementation of the parallel PSO is constructed on a pool of threads and each thread executes tasks associated to a particle from the swarm. Experiments showed that our proposed model can achieve a higher accuracy than regular SVM and outperforms other classifiers (C4.5, Naive Bayes). Furthermore, parallel version of standard Particle Swam Optimization(PSO) can efficiently select parameters for SVM.","","978-1-4799-3731-8","","10.1109/AQTR.2014.6857840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857840","Particle Swarm Optimization;Support Vector Machine;parallelism;spam host","Accuracy;Kernel;Particle swarm optimization;Sensitivity;Standards;Support vector machines;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;Web sites;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;search engines;security of data;support vector machines;unsolicited e-mail","Internet;PSO;SVM;Web spamming dataset;particle swarm optimization;phishing;search engines;spam Websites;spam host classification;spam host detection;support vector machines","","0","","18","","","22-24 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Abuse of cloud resources poses an important problem for cloud service providers. If third parties are affected by abuse, bad publicity or legal liabilities may ensue for the provider. There is an unsatisfactory level of protection against abuse of cloud offerings at the moment. In this paper, we analyse the current state of abuse detection and prevention in IaaS cloud computing. To establish what constitutes abuse in an IaaS environment, a survey of acceptable use policies of cloud service providers was conducted. We have found that existing intrusion detection and prevention techniques are only of limited use in this environment due to the high level of control that users can exercise over their resources. However, cloud computing opens up different opportunities for intrusion detection. We present possible approaches for abuse detection, which we plan to investigate further in future work.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2015.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299917","abuse;cloud computing;outbound intrusion detection","Cloud computing;Command and control systems;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Malware;Servers","cloud computing;security of data","IaaS cloud computing;IaaS environment;abuse detection and prevention;bad publicity;cloud offering;cloud resource;cloud service provider;intrusion detection and prevention technique;legal liability;online service","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the deployment scenarios, the functionality requirements, and the limited capabilities of these networks expose them to a wide-range of attacks against control traffic (such as wormholes, Sybil attacks, rushing attacks, etc). In this paper we propose a lightweight protocol called DICAS that mitigates these attacks by detecting, diagnosing, and isolating the malicious nodes. DICAS uses as a fundamental building block the ability of a node to oversee its neighboring nodes communication. On top of DICAS, we build a secure routing protocol, LSR, which in addition supports multiple node-disjoint paths. We analyze the security guarantees of DICAS and use ns-2 simulations to show its effectiveness against three representative attacks. Overhead analysis is conducted to prove the lightweight nature of DICAS.","","0-7695-2369-2","","10.1109/SECURECOMM.2005.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607562","control attack.;monitoring;neighbor;node-disjoint paths;secure routing;sensor network security","Analytical models;Application software;Biomedical monitoring;Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Data security;Intelligent networks;Military computing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","","control attack.;monitoring;neighbor;node-disjoint paths;secure routing;sensor network security","","17","2","40","","","05-09 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes the network susceptible to Byzantyne faults with packets getting misrouted, corrupted or dropped. In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the ""detection manager"" to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks that contain malicious nodes indicate that unobtrusive monitoring has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate.","","0-7803-8104-1","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292276","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Fault detection;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","detection manager;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;security attacks;unobtrusive monitoring technique","","3","1","18","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
