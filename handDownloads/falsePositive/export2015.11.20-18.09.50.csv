DSN '07. 37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on","20070716","2007","","","10","19","Although there are various ways to exploit software vulnerabilities for malicious attacks, the attacks always result in unexpected behavior in program execution, deviating from what the programmer/user intends to do. Program execution blindly follows the execution path specified by control flow transfer instructions with the targets generated at run-time without any validation. An enhancement is therefore proposed to secure program execution by introducing a validation mechanism over control flow transfer instructions at micro-architecture level. The proposed scheme, as a behavior-based protection, treats a triplet of the indirect branch's location, its target address, and the execution path preceding it as a behavior signature of program execution and validates it at run-time. The first two pieces of information can prevent an adversary from overwriting control data and introducing foreign code or impossible targets to redirect an indirect branch. The last one is necessary to defeat the attacks that use a legitimate target but follow an unintended execution path. Interestingly, the branch predictor is found to contain the signature information already and doing a portion of the validation when resolving the branch, thus greatly reducing the validation frequency. An enhancement of branch target buffer (BTB) entry together with a signature table implemented in the form of a Bloom filter in hardware is proposed to incorporate the validation into the processor's pipeline, providing a new defense in the processor architecture to secure program execution.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4272951","Bloom Filter;Branch Predictor;Control Flow Validation;Indirect Branch;Software Protection","Control systems;Data mining;Data security;Decision making;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Programming profession;Protection;Runtime","program diagnostics;program verification;security of data","branch target buffer;program execution security;software vulnerabilities;unintended execution path;validation mechanism","","3","","29","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Centroid-Based Nearest Neighbor Feature Representation for E-Government Intrusion Detection","Chih-Fong Tsai; Jung-Hsiang Tsai; Jui-Sheng Chou","Dept. of Inf. Manage., Nat.

The aims of e-government are to promote executive efficiencies, to reduce transaction costs of citizen, and to increase the responsiveness of the public sector. However, the requirement of pursuing these goals is based on the security measures of intrusion detection systems (IDS). If technologies are not advanced enough to distinguish between normal connections and illegal attacks, citizens would be doubtful in using the access of e-government to interact with the public sector and will eventually lose the trust of government. Technically, feature representation is an important key to successful pattern classification. However, very few studies focus on extracting better representative features of normal connections and attacks for better detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel feature representation approach by cluster centers and nearest neighbors, namely CANN. In this approach, two distances are measured and summed. The first one is based on the distance between each data sample and its cluster center, and the second distance is between the data and its nearest neighbor in the same cluster. Then, this new and one-dimensional distance based feature is used to represent each data sample for intrusion detection The experimental results based on the KDD-Cup 99 dataset show that CANN not only can make the k-nearest neighbor classifier perform reasonably well, but also provides high computational efficiency for the time of training and testing a classifier.","","978-1-4577-1459-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6170432","","Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Training","Internet;government data processing;pattern classification;public administration;security of data;transaction processing;trusted computing","CANN;IDS;KDD-Cup 99 dataset;centroid-based nearest neighbor feature representation;cluster centers;computational efficiency;e-government intrusion detection;executive efficiency;feature representation approach;government trust;illegal attacks;intrusion detection systems;k-nearest neighbor classifier;modern governance;nearest neighbors;normal connections;one-dimensional distance;pattern classification;public sector;security measures;transaction costs","","1","","18","","","5-6 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow- alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof- of-concept. We evaluate prediction accuracy of candidate ML algorithms on actual packet traces.

Problematically, recent reports have revealed incidents of energy theft in which dishonest customers would lower their electricity bills (aka stealing electricity) by tampering with their meters. The physical attack can be extended to a network attack by means of false data injection (FDI). This paper is thus motivated to investigate the currently-studied FDI attack by introducing the combination sum of energy profiles (CONSUMER) attack in a coordinated manner on a number of customers' smart meters, which results in a lower energy consumption reading for the attacker and a higher reading for the others in a neighborhood. We propose a CONSUMER attack model that is formulated into one type of coin change problems, which minimizes the number of compromised meters subject to the equality of an aggregated load to evade detection. A hybrid detection framework is developed to detect anomalous and malicious activities by incorporating our proposed grid sensor placement algorithm with observability analysis to increase the detection rate.

Due to these particularities, classical routing protocols cannot be used and some specific ones have been proposed. Because routing process is fundamental in a MANET deployment, it constitutes a privileged target of attackers. In this paper we propose a novel reputation-based clustering mechanism to locate malicious nodes and isolate them. In order to reduce network overhead and to handle network topology dynamicity, the proposed mechanism is based on a specific clustering environment. The clustering maintenance complexity is for its part reduced by the use of a reputation based delegation process allowing the cluster-head to delegate its privileges to a chosen cluster member in case of displacement or lack of energy. Moreover, node's reputation handling allows the detection and isolation of malicious nodes. Five modules constitute this mechanism: a monitoring module to detect malicious nodes, a reputation module to update reputation values, an isolation module to discard malicious nodes, an identity recognition module to assess alerts sources and a delegation module to allow clusterhead privileges delegation.","","","","10.1109/ARES.2013.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657258","Clustering;Delegation;MANET;Reputation;Routing;Security","Clustering algorithms;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Topology","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET deployment;MANET routing security;cluster-head privileges delegation;clustering maintenance complexity;delegation module;identity recognition module;malicious node detection;malicious node isolation;mobile ad hoc network;monitoring module;network overhead;network topology dynamicity;reputation based delegation process;reputation handling;reputation-based clustering mechanism;routing process;routing protocols","","1","","9","","","2-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The general idea in this paper is to introduce collaboration achieved by taking advantage of various kinds of contextual information and thus enable IDS to correctly identify successful attacks while simultaneously reducing the number of false positives. In this paper, a multilevel event correlation structure is proposed by firstly assigning each alert a value of confidence using contextual information and then correlates the preprocessed alerts based on improved temporal causal correlation combining with confidence value. At the end, a scenario graph and a high-level alert with final confidence are presented, which indicates the reliability of attacks launched through specific path.

While the concept of virtual machine monitor (VMM) signifies implementing an abstraction layer between the underlying host and the guest operating system (OS) to enforce security, its kernel is required to be free of vulnerabilities that intruders can use to compromise the host. In Xen, guest applications make resource requests through the hyper-call API to transfer the privilege to the VMM kernel for executing privileged operations. On a cloud scale, there exist hundreds of VM networks and thousands of guest operating systems (OSes) running on virtual domains. There is every possibility of intruders trying to misuse the hyper-call interface to compromise guest OS kernels and finally the host OS kernel itself. Sophisticated attacks can be launched in the distributed and collaborative style thereby bypassing most current intrusion detection systems. Collabra acts as a filtering layer which is completely integrated with every VMM. It scans through each call by incorporating integrity checking and collaborative detection mechanisms. It exists in multiple instances, and acts concurrently over a VMM network interacting with other instances to detect (possibly collaborative) attacks and prevent illicit access to the VMM and the host. An admin version of Collabra exists on a privileged domain in the VM network to perform filtering of malicious add-ons to hyper-calls at the guest OS level itself before routing the call to the VMM.","","978-1-61284-427-5","978-0-7695-4367-3","10.1109/ITNG.2011.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945321","cloud computing;distributed intrusion detection system;hyper-call;intrusion detection architecture;virtual machine","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Driver circuits;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors","application program interfaces;cloud computing;computer network security;groupware;operating system kernels;virtual machines;virtual private networks","Collabra;Xen hypervisor based collaborative intrusion detection system;abstraction layer;cloud security;distributed intrusion detection platform;filtering layer;guest operating system;hyper-call API;hyper-call interface;malicious add-ons filtering;virtual machine monitor;virtualized network","","10","","24","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The promising experimental results obtained show that the proposed scheme can actively contribute to the usual hard task of creating signatures for new attacks, thus improving the general monitoring and security management of network environments.","","978-1-4244-6748-8","","10.1109/AICT.2010.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5489797","Anomaly detection;intrusion detection;network services;signature generation","Computer science;Databases;Environmental management;Information analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Signal generators;Telematics","digital signatures","anomalous contents;automatic signature generation;intrusion detection systems;network services;security management;selective extraction","","0","","14","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in comparison to wired network or infrastructure-based wireless network, MANET is particularly vulnerable to security attacks due to its fundamental characteristics, e.g., the open medium, dynamic network topology, autonomous terminal, lack of centralized monitoring and management. The black hole attack is one of such security risks. In this attack, a malicious node falsely advertise shortest path to the destination node with an intension to disrupt the communication. In this paper, we propose a solution to the black hole attack in one of the most prominent routing algorithm, ad-hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing, for the MANETs. The proposed method uses promiscuous mode to detect malicious node (black hole) and propagates the information of malicious node to all the other nodes in the network. The simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed method as throughput of the network does not deteriorate in presence of the back holes.","","978-1-4673-2172-3","","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296067","AODV;Ad-hoc network;Black Hole Attack;Malicious node;Secured Routing","Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","AODV routing protocol;MANET;ad-hoc on demand distance vector routing;autonomous terminal;black hole problem prevention;centralized management;centralized monitoring;dynamic network topology;infrastructure-based wireless network;malicious node detection;mobile ad-hoc network;mobile devices;open medium;promiscuous mode;security attacks;wired network","","6","","21","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These features open doors for attackers to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that target at degrading the quality of cloud service. This paper studies an attack scenario that malicious tenants use cloud resources to launch DoS attack targeting at data center subnets. Unlike traditional data flow based detections, which heavily depend on the pattern of data flows, we propose an approach that takes advantage of virtual machine status including CPU usage and network usage to identify the attack. We notice that malicious virtual machines exhibit similar status patterns when attack is launched. Based on this observation, information entropy is applied in monitoring the status of virtual machines to identify the attack behaviors.

Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems either focus on just one layer of observation or use a limited number of metrics without proper data fusion techniques. However, the true status of a network is rarely accurately detectable by examining only one network layer. This paper describes a synergistic approach of fusing decisions of whether an attack takes place by using multiple measurements from different layers of wireless communication networks. The described method is implemented on a live system that monitors a wireless network in real time and gives an indication of whether a malicious frame exists or not. This is achieved by analysing specific metrics and comparing them against historical data. The proposed system assigns for each metric a belief of whether an attack takes place or not. The beliefs from different metrics are fused with the Dempster-Shafer technique with the ultimate goal of limiting false alarms by combining beliefs from various network layers. The on-line experimental results show that cross-layer techniques and data fusion perform more efficiently compared to conventional methods.","","978-1-4577-0455-0","","10.1109/IWMN.2011.6088478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088478","Cross-layer measurements;Data fusion;Dempster-Shafer;Wi-Fi;Wireless attacks","Intrusion detection;Measurement;Monitoring;Real time systems;Web sites;Wireless networks","inference mechanisms;radiocommunication;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","Dempster-Shafer technique;computer network;cross-layer technique;intrusion detection system;malicious frame;multilayer data fusion;online wireless attack detection system;synergistic approach;wireless communication network","","0","","11","","","10-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But in today's distributed computer networks, the various and frequent attacks make an effective detection difficult. This paper presents a covariance matrix based second-order statistical method to detect multiple known and unknown network anomalies. The detection method is initially based on the observations of the correlativity changes in typical flooding DoS attacks. It utilizes the difference of covariance matrices among observed samples in the detection. As case studies, extensive experiments are conducted to detect multiple DoS attacks - the prevalent Internet anomalies.

However, it is quite difficult to identify these spoofing attacks without assistance from other nodes. By exploiting some unique characteristics (e.g., rapid spatial decorrelation, independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI), we design and implement CSITE, a prototype system to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames on PHY layer merely by one station. Our system CSITE, built upon off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without collaboration and in-advance fingerprint. Several novel techniques are designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel dynamics. To verify the performances of our solution, we conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method.

The growing network intrusions have put companies and organizations at a much greater risk of loss. In this paper, propose a new learning methodology towards developing a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) by back propagation neural networks (BPN). The main function of Intrusion Detection System is to protect the resources from threats. It analyzes and predicts the behaviours of users, and then these behaviours will be considered an attack or a normal behaviour. There are several techniques which exist at present to provide more security to the network, but most of these techniques are static. Test the proposed method by a benchmark intrusion dataset to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. Results show that choosing good attributes and samples will not only have impact on the performance, but also on the overall execution efficiency.

Mobile ad hoc networks is highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium, dynamically changing network topology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management point. The traditional way of protecting networks with firewalls and encryption software is no longer sufficient and effective for those features. In this paper, we propose a distributed intrusion detection approach based on finish state machine (FSM).A cluster-based detection scheme is presented, where periodically a node is elected as the monitor node for a cluster. These monitor nodes can not only make local intrusion detection decisions, but also cooperatively take part in global intrusion detection. And then we construct the finite state machine (FSM) by the way of manually abstracting the correct behaviours of the node according to the routing protocol of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). The monitor nodes can verify every nodes behaviour by the FSM, and validly detect real-time attacks without signatures of intrusion or trained data. Compared with the architecture where each node is its own IDS agent, our approach is much more efficient while maintaining the same level of effectiveness.","","0-7695-2263-7","","10.1109/SAINTW.2005.1619986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1619986","","Authentication;Automata;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Protection;Routing protocols;Wireless communication","","","","5","","8","","","31-04 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of the IDSs proposed in the literature have been evaluated under certain network conditions such as the change of mobility speed, simulation time, mobility models, etc. However, none of these IDSs have been evaluated across the variation of mobile nodes (MNs). The increase of mobility nodes may directly impact the performance of the network and, consequently, the accuracy of the IDS. When the number of mobiles nodes goes up, intruders have better opportunity to spread over the existing paths and can trick the IDS. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the increase/decrease of mobile nodes on the performance of IDSs. The IDS chosen in this paper is the Adaptive Acknowledgment (AACK). Our experiments are accomplished in NS2 and configured in a way all parameters set to be fixed during the entire simulation, except the number of mobile nodes (cooperative and malicious), which repeatedly kept increasing.

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS). An implementation of NFEA has been evaluated and the result shows that NFEA is viable to deploy in real networks.","","978-1-4577-0524-3","978-0-7695-4429-8","10.1109/ISPAW.2011.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952007","DDoS attacks;IP traceback;network forensic;network security;packet marking","Computer crime;Cryptography;Decoding;Encoding;Forensics;IP networks;Radio frequency","Internet;computer forensics;computer network security","AEMS;DDoS attack;Internet crimes;NFEA;TCP/IP based networks;authenticated evidence marking scheme;firewall;flow-based selection marking scheme;intrusion detection system;malicious packet modifications;network forensic evidence acquisition;packet marking","","0","","30","","","26-28 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed architecture returns an attack graph that precisely identifies the route traversed by a given packet allowing the correct identification of the attacker. We show that previously published approaches may return misleading attack graphs in some particular situations, which may even avoid the determination of the real attacker. The proposed architecture has two other features that improve the efficiency of the returned attack graph: separate logs are kept for each router interface improving the distributed search procedure; an efficient dynamic log paging strategy is proposed.

The issue of spoofing, and its detection, in Wireless LANs has been a matter of serious debate and received wide spread attention in research community as well. Spoofing is a potent weapon in the hands of a Cyber Criminal. The very characteristics of spoofing makes the task of identification and tracking back of the perpetrator / initiator in Cyber Crimes very difficult, e.g. those relating to denial of service, session hijacking, and address masquerading attacks by changing its network identifiers in WLANs. One way to overcome the problem of spoofing is to authenticate the frames. However, in 802.11 WLANs, authentication and encryption for management and control frames is not provided. It is also observed that present MAC spoofing detection techniques bring out large number of false positives. This paper analyses the various spoofing detection methods in WLANs bringing out their pros and cons including the different level of security provided ranging from low to high.

While these attacks are very simple in implementation, their effect on WiFi networks can be devastating. To this end, several intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been employed to detect these attacks. In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network. Results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against the different versions of the attack compared to Snort-Wireless and can achieve a detection rate in average 100% and a false positive rate in average 0.1%","","1-4244-0700-1","","10.1109/CISDA.2007.368156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219103","","Computational intelligence;Data security;Detectors;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","digital signatures;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless LAN","GP-based IDS;WiFi networks;data link layer attacks;deauthentication attack;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;intrusion detector;snort-wireless","","0","","16","","","1-5 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542","","Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity","","0","","20","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, IDSs are known for generating many alerts, most of them being false. This makes the job of security analyst tougher as he/she has to sift through security events to filter out relevant alerts. In this process, the high priority alerts are not addressed quickly and there is a great risk of a legitimate attack going unnoticed. Many researchers have suggested various means of classifying the IDS alerts. A potentially useful candidate is to use network contextual information to segregate relevant and non-relevant alerts. In this paper we describe PIKE, Post-processor for IDS alerts using Knowledge-based Evaluation, a system that uses background information about the hosts present on the network and the vulnerability exploited to generate a score for each alert. The score is measure of the importance of the alert. A simple binary classifier then classifies the alert as relevant or irrelevant based on value of score threshold. PIKE makes the life of security analyst simpler by presenting the classified alerts which allows him/her to focus solely on the important alerts. We evaluate PIKE for a custom dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of using contextual sensitivity as a basis of classification.","","978-1-4673-0296-8","978-1-4673-0297-5","10.1109/COMSNETS.2012.6151339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6151339","Alert classification;Context sensitivity;False positives;Network security;Signature based intrusion detection","Accuracy;Context;Databases;Knowledge based systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Security","computer network security;digital signatures;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS alert classification;PIKE;Signature based Intrusion Detection Systems;binary classifier;contextual sensitivity;knowledge based evaluation;knowledge-based evaluation;legitimate attack;network activities;network contextual information;network traffic;score threshold value;security violations","","0","","23","","","3-7 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensitive information is often stored within the database. Traditional mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication cannot provide a high level of confidence. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find dependency and sequence rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels. Also, it gains advantages of a hybrid method, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection, to minimize both false positive and false negative errors. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5658-6","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030322","Database Security;Inter-Transaction Dependency;Inter-Transaction Sequence;Intrusion Detection;State machine","Authentication;Databases","data mining;security of data","access control;anomaly detection;data mining;database intrusion detection;database transaction level;encryption;intertransaction level;user task level","","0","","12","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this model we try to represent the complex case structural information through class hierarchy. The new method not only overcomes limitations that traditional attribute-value case representation can not represent complex cases, but also combines domain knowledge and case representation through constraint rules. In the aspect of case similarity, we divide it into two categories: the intra- class similarity and the inter-class similarity, which shows more accurate and convenient.

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying ""blindspots"" in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing","data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data","attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing","","1","","30","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to group data set into multiple clusters. Using clustering algorithm to detect anomaly behavior has good scalability and adaptability. This paper mainly focuses on improving k-means clustering algorithm, and uses it to detect the abnormal records. Our goal is to increase the DR value and decrease the FAR value in anomaly detection by calculating appropriate value of parameters and improve the clustering algorithm. In our IE&FSDM algorithm, we use network records' minimum standard information entropy to compute the initial cluster centers. In testing phase, discrepancy metric is introduced to help calculate exact number of clusters in testing data set. Using the results of initial cluster centers calculated in the pre-phase, IE&FSDM compute the actual clusters by converging cluster centers and obtains the actual cluster centers according to the frequency sensitive discrepancy metric. Then comply with the improved k-means algorithm, iterative calculate until divide all network data into corresponding clusters, and according to the results of cluster we can classify the normal and abnormal network behaviors. At last, we use KDD CUP1999 dataset to implement IE&FSDM algorithm. Test results show that comparing with previous clustering methods, IE&FSDM algorithm improve the detection rate of anomaly behavior and reduce the false alarm rate.","","","","10.1109/ISCC-C.2013.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973690","Anomaly Detection;Clustering;Discrepancy Metric;Information Entropy;k-menas","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information entropy;Measurement;Testing;Training","entropy;pattern clustering;security of data","DR value;FAR value;IE&FSDM algorithm;KDD CUP1999 dataset;anomaly detection;clustering analysis;frequency sensitive discrepancy metric;information entropy;intrusion detection technology;k-means clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","7-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since it is not technically feasible to build a system with no vulnerabilities, intrusion detection (ID) has become an important area for researches. An intrusion that deviates only slightly from a pattern derived from the audit data may not be detected or a small change in normal behavior may cause a wrong data. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) offer techniques for modeling and recognizing normal and abusive system behavior. GAs can be successfully used to tune the membership functions used by the IDS. In this paper a survey were performed approaches based on IDS, and on implementing of GAs (GAs) on IDS.","","978-0-7695-3184-7","","10.1109/CISIM.2008.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557881","","Application software;Availability;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection","genetic algorithms;security of data","World Wide Web;abusive system behavior modeling;computer network security;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection system;membership function;normal system behavior modeling","","5","","25","","","26-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To accommodate this increase in application and data complexity, web services have moved to a multitiered design wherein the webserver runs the application front-end logic and data are outsourced to a database or file server. In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","4","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The objective of this paper is to incorporate different methods to detect and classify intrusion from normal network packet. Among several evolutionary techniques, Steady State Genetic-based Machine Leaning Algorithm (SSGBML) will be used to detect intrusions with Zeroth Level Classifier system (ZCS) are investigated here. Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations. ZCS is used to play the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether the current message is normal or intrusion and receiving feedback from environment. The experiments and evaluations of the proposed method were performed with the KDD 99 intrusion detection dataset.","","978-1-4244-8844-5","978-1-4244-8845-2","10.1109/ICCTD.2010.5645857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645857","Network Intrusion Detection;SGA;SSGA;SSGBML;ZCS;component","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;Detectors;Fires;Monitoring;Probes","Internet;computer network security;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Internet service;KDD 99 intrusion detection dataset;Zeroth level classifier system;computer network;discovery mechanism;event monitoring;evolutionary method;network intrusion detection;steady state genetic-based machine leaning algorithm","","0","","24","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sensors often vary by manufacturer and software version, making the problem of creating generalized tools to separate true attacks from false positives particularly difficult. Often times it is useful from an operations perspective to know if a particular sensor is acting out of character. We propose a solution to this problem using anomaly detection techniques over the set of alarms produced by the sensors. Similar to the manner in which an anomaly based sensor detects deviations from normal user or system behavior, we establish the baseline behavior of a sensor and detect deviations from this baseline. We show that departures from this profile by a sensor have a high probability of being artifacts of genuine attacks. We evaluate a set of time-based Markovian heuristics against a simple compression algorithm and show that we are able to detect the existence of all attacks which were manually identified by security personnel, drastically reduce the number of false positives, and identify attacks which were overlooked during manual evaluation.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284168","anomaly detection;hidden markov model;intrusion detection;markov chain","Conference management;Data engineering;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Needles;Sensor systems","data compression;hidden Markov models;security of data","anomaly detection techniques;compression algorithm;deviation detection;false alarm suppression;generalized tools;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection data sets;intrusion detection sensors;managed security service providers;software version;time-based Markovian heuristics","","0","","28","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because they are not packet-based, they cannot be detected or prevented using network security measures. The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls. The assumption is that exploits will be manifested as previously-unobserved sequences of hypercalls.

In this paper, we investigate localization attacks aiming to identify ITM monitor location and propose the formal model of such attacks using communication channel theory. We also develop novel techniques that significantly increases the accuracy, efficiency, and secrecy of ITM localization attacks. Specifically, we introduce (i) a frequency-based modulation technique to effectively reduce the interference from the background traffic and achieve a high attack accuracy, (ii) both time and space hopping techniques to randomize signal pattern and make the attack hard to detect by the defender, and (iii) Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) based techniques to increase the attack efficiency of identifying multiple monitors simultaneously.

"Robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection","Ye, N.; Yebin Zhang; Borror, C.M.","Inf. & Syst. Assurance Lab., Tempe, AZ, USA","Reliability, IEEE Transactions on","20040405","2004","53","1","116","123","Cyber-attack detection is used to identify cyber-attacks while they are acting on a computer and network system to compromise the security (e.g., availability, integrity, and confidentiality) of the system. This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2004.823851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169","","Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing","Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security","Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size","","38","1","56","","","March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This anomaly detection approach is part of an intrusion warning system (IWS) for dynamic coalition environments. It is designed to indicate suspicious actions and tendencies and to provide decision support on how to react on anomalies.

"Robust Correlation of Encrypted Attack Traffic through Stepping Stones by Flow Watermarking","Xinyuan Wang; Reeves, D.S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA, USA","Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on","20110314","2011","8","3","434","449","Network-based intruders seldom attack their victims directly from their own computer. Often, they stage their attacks through intermediate “stepping stones” in order to conceal their identity and origin. To identify the source of the attack behind the stepping stone(s), it is necessary to correlate the incoming and outgoing flows or connections of a stepping stone. To resist attempts at correlation, the attacker may encrypt or otherwise manipulate the connection traffic. Timing-based correlation approaches have been shown to be quite effective in correlating encrypted connections. However, timing-based correlation approaches are subject to timing perturbations that may be deliberately introduced by the attacker at stepping stones. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based-correlation scheme that is designed specifically to be robust against timing perturbations. Unlike most previous timing-based correlation approaches, our watermark-based approach is “active” in that it embeds a unique watermark into the encrypted flows by slightly adjusting the timing of selected packets. The unique watermark that is embedded in the encrypted flow gives us a number of advantages over passive timing-based correlation in resisting timing perturbations by the attacker. In contrast to the existing passive correlation approaches, our active watermark-based correlation does not make any limiting assumptions about the distribution or random process of the original interpacket timing of the packet flow. In theory, our watermark-based correlation can achieve arbitrarily close to 100 percent correlation true positive rate (TPR), and arbitrarily close to 0 percent false positive rate (FPR) at the same time for sufficiently long flows, despite arbitrarily large (but bounded) timing perturbations of any distribution by the attacker. Our paper is the first that identifies 1) accurate quantitative tradeoffs between the achievable correlation effectiveness - nd the defining characteristics of the timing perturbation; and 2) a provable upper bound on the number of packets needed to achieve a desired correlation effectiveness, given the amount of timing perturbation. Experimental results show that our active watermark-based correlation performs better and requires fewer packets than existing, passive timing-based correlation methods in the presence of random timing perturbations.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5551157","Network-level security and protection;correlation;intrusion tracing;stepping stone.","Correlation;Cryptography;Decoding;Delay;Robustness;Watermarking","cryptography;random processes;watermarking","encrypted attack traffic;false positive rate;flow watermarking;network based intruder;random timing perturbation;stepping stones;true positive rate;watermark based correlation scheme","","1","","37","","2010-08-19","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant. And even we try to use the sporadic well-mannered cooperative behavior of the malicious node in favor of improving overall throughput of our WSN.

Control-flow-based detectors monitor the sequence of system calls, while data-flow-based detectors monitor the data propagation among arguments of system calls. Besides pointing out that data-flow-based detectors can be layered on top of control-flow-based ones (or vice versa) to improve accuracy, there is a large gap between the two research directions in that research along one direction had been fairly isolated and had not made good use of results from the other direction. In this paper, we show how data-flow analysis can leverage results from control-flow analysis to learn more accurate and useful rules for anomaly detection. Our results show that the proposed control-flow-analysis-aided data-flow analysis reveals some accurate and useful rules that cannot be learned in prior data-flow analysis techniques. These relations among system call arguments and return values are useful in detecting many real attacks. A trace-driven evaluation shows that the proposed technique enjoys low false-alarm rates and overhead when implemented on a production server.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721575","anomaly detection;control-flow;data-flow;system call argument","Computer security;Control system analysis;Control systems;Counting circuits;Data analysis;Detectors;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis","data flow analysis;security of data","anomaly detection;control-flow analysis;control-flow-based detectors;data propagation;data-flow analysis;data-flow-based detectors;false-alarm rates;intrusion detection;production server;system calls","","3","","21","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
