Due to large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviors, optimizing performance of IDS becomes an important open problem that is receiving more and more attention from the research community. Intrusion poses a serious security risk in a network environment. The ever growing new intrusion types pose a serious problem for their detection. The human labeling of the available network audit data instances is usually tedious, time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called k-means clustering via naïve bayes classification for anomaly based network intrusion detection. Experimental results on the KDD cup'99 data set show the novelty of our approach in detecting network intrusion. It is observed that the proposed technique performs better in terms of Detection rate when applied to KDD'99 data sets compared to a naïve bayes based approach.","","978-1-4673-0213-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215635","Detection Rate and False Positive Rates;K-Means Clustering;Naïve Bayesian Classification;Network Intrusion Detection;ROC graph","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Companies;Humans;Labeling;Probes;Security","","","","1","","15","","","30-31 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is an important tool to protect computer networks from attacks. Traditional packet-based NIDSs are time-intensive as they analyze all network packets. A state-of-the-art NIDS should be able to handle a high volume of traffic in real time. Flow-based intrusion detection is an effective method for high speed networks since it inspects only packet headers. The existence of new attacks in the future is another challenge for intrusion detection. Anomaly-based intrusion detection is a well-known method capable of detecting unknown attacks. In this paper, we propose a flow-based anomaly detection system. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an important approach for anomaly detection. We used a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with one hidden layer. We investigate the use of a Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) in optimizing interconnection weights of a MLP network. Our proposed GSA-based flow anomaly detection system (GFADS) is trained with a flow-based data set. The trained system can classify benign and malicious flows with 99.43% accuracy. We compare the performance of GSA with traditional gradient descent training algorithms and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results show that GFADS is effective in flow-based anomaly detection.

Therefore, our intelligent false alarm filter can keep reducing the number of false alarms at a high and stable level. In this paper, we aim to conduct a case study in exploring the performance of our developed false alarm filter by implementing a fuzzy classifier based on if-then rules.

Android is one of the most widely used mobile OS these days and that is the reason why it is the best practice to develop application on Android platform. The application for disseminating location based weather forecast is a client-server application on Android platform. It provides weather forecast information as per user's location or location of interest. While developing a client-server application, the communication between client and database server becomes imperative. This paper discusses detailed analysis for choosing appropriate type of web service, data exchange protocols, data exchange format, and Mobile positioning technologies for client-server application. It also highlights issues like memory capacity, security, poor response time, and battery consumption in mobile devices. This paper is about exploring effective options to establish the dissemination service over smart phones with Android OS.","","","","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164786","Android;Battery Consumption;Location Based Services;Response time;Security","Batteries;Mobile communication;Simple object access protocol;Smart phones;XML","Global Positioning System;Web services;client-server systems;electronic data interchange;information dissemination;protocols;smart phones","LBS;MOSDAC;Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre;Web service;android applications;battery consumption;client-server application;data exchange format;data exchange protocols;database server;dissemination service;information services;location based application development;location based service;memory capacity;mobile OS;mobile devices;mobile positioning system;response time;smart phones;weather forecast information dissemination","","0","","38","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Main problem with signature based technique is its vulnerability to unknown attacks. But the problem with anomaly based technique is that they give a lot of false alarms and very difficult to realize. Entropy is one of the anomaly detection technique used in intrusion detection. In this paper we are designing a system with the help of Entropy based technique and integrating with real time system Snort so that it can have advantages of both techniques. Also another issue of IDS, hectic amount of alert data, has also been addressed by developing alert reduction and ranking system.

Extant solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely mainly on prior explicit knowledge of specific worm signatures. As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets. Our results indicate that using this approach resulted in exceeding 90% mean accuracy, and for specific unknown worms accuracy reached above 99%, using just 20 features while maintaining a low level of false positive rate.","","1-4244-0705-2","","10.1109/CIDM.2007.368873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221297","","Computational intelligence;Computer worms;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Delay;File systems;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Operating systems;Software packages","data mining;invasive software","World Wide Web;background application activity;computer behavior;computer configurations;computer measurements;computer worm detection;data mining;feature selection","","1","","31","","","March 1 2007-April 5 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system combines the misuse detection and anomaly detection components in which the random forests algorithm is applied.

IDS are an effective way to detect different kinds of attacks in an interconnected network thereby securing the network. An effective Intrusion Detection System requires high accuracy and detection rate as well as low false alarm rate. This paper focuses on a hybrid approach for intrusion detection system (IDS) based on data mining techniques. The main research method is clustering analysis with the aim to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. Most of the previously proposed methods suffer from the drawback of k-means method with low detection rate and high false alarm rate. This paper presents a hybrid data mining approach encompassing feature selection, filtering, clustering, divide and merge and clustering ensemble. A method for calculating the number of the cluster centroid and choosing the appropriate initial cluster centroid is proposed in this paper. The IDS with clustering ensemble is introduced for the effective identification of attacks to achieve high accuracy and detection rate as well as low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4799-2432-5","","10.1109/ICACCI.2013.6637422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637422","Intrusion detection system;clustering;data mining;detection rate;ensemble;false alarm rate;k-means","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Conferences;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Partitioning algorithms","Internet;computer network security;data mining;feature extraction;pattern clustering","IDS;Internet;clustering analysis;data mining methods;data mining techniques;false alarm rate;feature clustering;feature filtering;feature selection;hybrid data mining approach;interconnected network;intrusion detection approach;intrusion detection system;k-means method","","1","","14","","","22-25 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, we may adapt for less accuracy in order to gain speed for both with and/or without parallel processing techniques. We also construct an adaptive learning algorithm to update the model.

Our scheme borrows from small worlds, utilizes the concept of contacts, and use traffic pattern matching (TPM) and traffic volume matching (TVM) techniques.

To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination. The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-99) dataset is used as a benchmark to compare this method with other existing techniques.

Detecting such potentially unknown sequences is the core problem in intrusion detection. In this paper, we focus on the problem of observing attacks over non-uniform, partially asynchronous event sets. We hence propose charactering attacks as partially ordered sets, and we show how these can be detected asynchronously, as will typically be the case in a modern computing architecture. By extending a naïve model incorporating subsets of known causal dependencies, enhanced observation strategies minimizing the number and cost of observations can be derived. This incorporation of knowledge regarding constraints on attack causality into observations allows for notable enhancements in the efficiency of detection. We also provide a simple example of an application of the model for the case of an intrusion detection system on a co-processor observing a host, although the model is intended for arbitrary non-uniform architectures and concurrent operations.","","978-1-4673-2160-0","","10.1109/ISSA.2012.6320435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6320435","Intrusion detection;asynchronous and partially asynchronous observation;causality models","Cryptography","security of data","arbitrary nonuniform architectures;attack causality;causal dependencies;charactering attacks;concurrent operations;coprocessor;intrusion detection system;malicious behavior;modern computing architecture;naïve model;nontrivial attack;partially asynchronous event sets;partially asynchronous observation;partially ordered sets","","0","","16","","","15-17 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Almost all available commercial and research sensor nodes are equipped with ZigBee transceiver chips, and thus making ZigBee the de-facto standard in WSN communication. Since Joshua Wright's KillerBee Framework was released with its focus on exploring and exploiting the security of ZigBee networks, non security-hardened WSNs increase the risk of being vulnerable against certain attacks such as simple association flooding and packet replay attacks. We propose an anomaly-based approach intrusion detection system (IDS) optimized for ZigBee-based WSN to protect ZigBee-based WSN nodes against KillerBee supported attacks. We describe the KillerBee attack procedure and propose an approach of guarding a ZigBee transceiver.

In this paper, a BN is used to build automatic intrusion detection system based on signature recognition. The goal is to recognize signatures of known attacks, match the observed behavior with those known signatures, and signal intrusion when there is a match. A major difficulty of this system is that intrusions signatures change over the time and the system must be retrained. An IDS must be able to adapt to these changes.

Patterns based detectors used in Packet Inspection implement multi-pattern matching algorithms to check whether the packet payload have a specified patterns in a patterns set. Computational cost is one of the major concerns of the commercial Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Although these systems are proven to be promising in detecting network abnormalities, they need to check all the patterns to identify a suspicious abnormal in the worst case. This is time consuming. This paper proposes an efficient two-level IDS, which applies a statistical patterns approach and a Sequential Differentiate Method (SeqDM) for the detection of unauthorized packets. The two-level system converts high-faceted character space into a low-faceted character space. It is able to reduce the computational cost and integrates groups of patterns into an identical patterns. The integration of patterns reduces the cost involved for valid packet identification. The final decision is made on the integrated low-faceted character space. Finally, the proposed two-level system is evaluated using DARPA 1999 IDS dataset for the detection of unauthorized packets.","","978-1-4673-1911-9","","10.1109/ICACC.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305551","Intrusion detection;Network Security;Packet inspection;Pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Detectors;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","Internet;computer network security;inspection;pattern matching;statistical analysis","Internet;SeqDM;deep packet inspection;firewalls;high-faceted character space;integrated low-faceted character space;intrusion detection systems;multipattern matching algorithms;network security;packet identification;pattern based detectors;sequential differentiate method;statistical pattern approach;two-level IDS;two-level packet inspection;unauthorized packet detection","","0","","22","","","9-11 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are security protocols that prevent unauthorized nodes from accessing the network through authentication. Secrecy of information is provided through encryption. However these protocols cannot detect if any member of the network degrades the network performance due to misbehavior. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors what is going on in the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies based on the monitored information and notifies other nodes in the network to take necessary steps such as to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. In this paper we propose an IDS, referred to as the SAHN-IDS, suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks like a SAHN (suburban ad-hoc network). SAHN-IDS detects misbehavior based on nodes getting an unfair share of the transmission channel. It also detects anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. Unlike most IDSs for detecting anomalies in packet forwarding, SAHN-IDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes, since that is ineffective in networks where nodes use different transmission power, different frequency channels and directional antennas for different neighbors. Moreover, unlike most IDSs, most of the thresholds in SAHN-IDS are set dynamically. We show the effectiveness of SAHN-IDS through simulations.","","0-7803-9311-2","","10.1109/TENCON.2005.300979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085224","","Access protocols;Ad hoc networks;Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Degradation;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;directive antennas;telecommunication security;wireless channels","anomaly detection;directional antennas;frequency channels;intrusion detection system;multihop ad-hoc wireless networks;packet forwarding;suburban ad-hoc networks;transmission channel;transmission power","","1","","22","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An improved hidden Markov model (HMM) is created for the detection engine which is capable of the immunology-based self/nonself discrimination. The classifications of normal and abnormal behaviour of system calls are further examined by an advanced fuzzy-based inference process called HPSOWM. Considering a real benchmark dataset from the public domain, our experimental results show that the proposed scheme can greatly shorten the training time of HMM and reduce the false positive rate significantly.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e.g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with <i>k</i> -means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2217325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392466","Anomaly;hidden Markov model (HMM);host-based intrusion detection;postmortem intrusion detection;sequitur","Computational modeling;Computer crime;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network security","authorisation;entropy;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","IT system;attack signature;computer security;cumulative detection rate;entropy-based approach;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection system maintenance;k-means classifier;log file analysis;postmortem intrusion detection;repetitive behavior;system vulnerability","","1","","52","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The main handicap of these mechanisms is extensive usage of hardware, especially CPU and memory. In this paper, we examine the hardware usage of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) with different network architectures. Although the virtualization is preferred by the most of the providers, we chose a virtualized environment as our test bed because of its easier implementation structure from other cloud technologies such as grid and blade architectures. We focused on a proxy NIDS architecture, which is a gateway-based approach (intrusion detection assignment carried out by an outer entity, so why we called it proxy) and has less hardware requirements than other positioning options. It is aimed to show an effective location to IDSs in a virtualized environment.

The authors focus on the identification of a group of especially harmful internal attackers-masqueraders. For both schemes, cell IDs traversed by each mobile user are extracted as the feature value. Specifically, the mobility pattern of each user is characterized by a high-order Markov model. The LZ-based detection scheme from the well-developed data compression techniques is derived. Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not.

An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users' behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users' behaviors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they are two of the most important components of mobile users' profiles. To utilize users' calling activities, we formulate the intrusion detection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and call destination are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users' calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model integrating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users' movement patterns. A user's movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users' current movement activities. We simulate users' various behaviors and provide simulation results.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2007.901875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4356991","Bayes decision rule;Bayesian decision rule;instance based learning;instance-based learning (IBL);intrusion detection;wireless network","","belief networks;cellular radio;mobile radio;radio access networks;safety systems;security of data","Bayesian decision rule;Gaussian kernel;Parzen window;cellular mobile systems;class conditional probability density function;fraudulent usage;intrusion detection system;mobile telecommunication services;wireless networks","","6","","27","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have therefore been proposed to address this coordinated defense challenge by correlating patterns of suspicious activity based on the source addresses of the suspicious incoming traffic. However, during worm outbreaks, there can be a rapid growth in suspicious evidence that is reported about individual sources of the worm outbreak. In CIDSs that correlate suspicious activity by source address, the evidence relating to these worm spread sources can cause a load ""hot-spot"", which severely degrades the overall performance of the detection system. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme for a CIDS to evenly distribute the workload to avoid hot-spots during worm outbreaks. Rather than correlating suspicious evidence based on source addresses, we distribute the load in the CIDS using a scheme that enables different possible patterns of suspicious evidence to be automatically mapped onto different processing nodes in the CIDS. Simulation results show that our scheme can achieve significant improvements in load balancing without sacrificing detection accuracy.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-2065-0","978-1-4244-2066-7","10.1109/NOMS.2008.4575116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4575116","","Collaboration;Collaborative software;Computer architecture;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Load management;Pattern analysis;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;groupware;invasive software;resource allocation","Internet;collaborative intrusion detection system;coordinated attacks;coordinated defense;detection accuracy;load balancing;load hot-spot;network security;source address;stealthy attacks;suspicious activity pattern;suspicious incoming traffic;workload distribution;worm outbreak;worm spread sources","","2","","14","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been researched for decades. Many anomaly detection methods have been proposed. Because of the simplicity of principles, statistical and Markovian methods dominate these approaches. However, their effectiveness is constrained by specific preconditions, which make them work for only appropriate data sets which satisfy their premises. Other than statistical and Markovian model, information theory provides a different perspective about anomaly detection. However, the computation of information theoretic measures is still based on statistics. In this paper, we present a novel, information theoretic anomaly detection framework. Instead of statistics, it employs lossless compression for measuring the information quantity, and detects outliers according to compression result. We also discuss the selection of underlying compression algorithm, and choose a grammar compression for utilizing the structure of data. With grammar compression, our method overcomes the shortcomings of statistical and Markovian methods. In addition, the implementation and operation of our method is even simpler than traditional approaches. We test our method on four data sets about text analyzing, host intrusion detection and bug detection. Experimental results show that, even traditional methods fail in some situations, our simple method works well in all cases.","","978-1-4673-1889-1","","10.1109/NAS.2012.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310873","anomaly detection;data mining;grammar-based compression","Compression algorithms;Entropy;Grammar;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Statistical analysis;Training","Markov processes;information theory;security of data;telecommunication security","Markovian method;Markovian model;anomaly detection algorithm;anomaly detection method;bug detection;compression algorithm;data structure;grammar compression;information quantity;information theoretic anomaly detection framework;information theoretic measures;information theory;intrusion detection;lossless compression;network security","","0","","26","","","28-30 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing data fusion systems rely generally on human experts but they lack of training dataset for the fusion techniques. Thus, useful autonomous approach should be applied to fuse data automatically and accurately. In this paper, a decision fusion approach based on clustering technique is proposed. This technique enables the generation of composite attack scenarios by selecting events generated by analyzers while considering their efficiency to detect attacks using defined efficiency criteria.

This paper presents a proactive network defense framework that can be integrated with existing quality-of-service (QoS) protocols to provide differentiated services to network traffic flows based on their distance from the normal behavior. We introduce a new metric that we refer to as abnormality distance (AD) metric that can be used to classify traffic into normal, probable normal, probable abnormal (suspicious traffic), and abnormal (attacking traffic). The AD metric can then be used in conjunction with any QoS protocol to give high priority to normal traffic and lower priority to abnormal traffic.

However, node misbehavior is a common phenomenon, thus, ad-hoc networks are subject to packet dropping, packet modification, packet misrouting, selfish node behavior, and so on.","","978-1-4673-2267-6","","10.1109/AICERA.2012.6306715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6306715","Adhoc Routing;MANET;NS2","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless networks","mobile ad hoc networks;radio links;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;ad-hoc networks;misbehavior node detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile nodes;packet dropping;packet misrouting;packet modification;selfish network nodes;selfish node behavior;trust evidence;trust levels;trust management schemes;wireless links","","1","","","","","19-21 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in a hostile military environment, such a node can be easily tampered by an adversary. In this paper, we propose a distributed cluster based anomaly detection scheme by assigning few randomly chosen cluster heads a critical task of estimating the reliability of the mobile beacon node. As localization of remaining nodes is cautiously performed only after verifying the authenticity of the mobile beacon node, a considerable overhead is saved in the incorrect localization of the entire network.

International Conference on","20050725","2005","","","216","225","Common practice in anomaly-based intrusion detection assumes that one size fits all: a single anomaly detector should detect all anomalies. Compensation for any performance shortcoming is sometimes effected by resorting to correlation techniques, which could be seen as making use of detector diversity. Such diversity is intuitively based on the assumption that detector coverage is different - perhaps widely different - for different detectors, each covering some disparate portion of the anomaly space. Diversity, then, enhances detection coverage by combining the coverages of individual detectors across multiple sub-regions of the anomaly space, resulting in an overall detection coverage that is superior to the coverage of any one detector. No studies have been done, however, in which measured effects of diversity amongst anomaly detectors have been obtained. This paper explores the effects of using diverse anomaly-detection algorithms in intrusion detection. Experimental results indicate that while performance/coverage improvements can in fact be effected by combining diverse detection algorithms, the gains are not the result of combining large, non-overlapping regions of the anomaly space. Rather, the gains are seen at the edges of the space, and are heavily dependent on the parameter values of the detectors, as well as on anomaly characteristics. Based on this study, defenders can be provided with knowledge of how combinations of diverse, sequence-based detectors behave to effect detection performance superior to that of a single detector.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467796","","Computer science;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Diversity reception;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Performance gain;Protocols;Security","fault tolerant computing;performance evaluation;security of data","anomaly detector performance;anomaly-detection algorithm;intrusion detection;sequence-based detector","","0","","21","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in the past researches on feature selection, the criteria and way about how to select the features in the raw data are seldom referred to. This paper shows us which type of features can aid us to achieve a better experimental result. In comparison to various types of intrusion attacks, the classical clustering algorithm, K-means is proposed to evaluate the features selected and prove the viewpoint based on KDD Cup 1999 DataSet. The knowledge of feature selection can be achieved by this means. With the usage of the statistics of network traffic, the better evaluation index, e.g. detection rate and false positive rate, are achieved than any other type of features.

As a result, routing data becomes more challenging. Ultimately routing protocols for such networks face the challenges of random topology change, nature of the link (symmetric or asymmetric) and power requirement during data transmission. Under such circumstances both, proactive as well as reactive routing are usually inefficient. We consider, zone routing protocol (ZRP) that adds the qualities of the proactive (IARP) and reactive (IERP) protocols. In ZRP, an updated topological map of zone centered on each node, is maintained. Immediate routes are available inside each zone. In order to communicate outside a zone, a route discovery mechanism is employed. The local routing information of the zones helps in this route discovery procedure. In MANET security is always an issue. It is possible that a node can turn malicious and hamper the normal flow of packets in the MANET. In order to overcome such issue we have used a clustering technique to separate the nodes having intrusive behavior from normal behavior. We call this technique as effective k-means clustering which has been motivated from k-means. We propose to implement Intrusion Detection System on each node of the MANET which is using ZRP for packet flow. Then we will use effective k-means to separate the malicious nodes from the network. Thus, our Ad-Hoc network will be free from any malicious activity and normal flow of packets will be possible.","","978-1-4799-3958-9","","10.1109/ICROIT.2014.6798303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798303","IARP;IDS effective k-means clustering;IERP;MANET;ZRP","Flowcharts;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Protocols;Routing","data mining;mobile ad hoc networks;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing;routing protocols;telecommunication security","K-means clustering method;MANET security;ZRP based MANET;ad-hoc network;clustering technique;data mining;data transmission;intrusion detection system;intrusive behavior;k-means;local routing information;malicious activity;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;packet flow;peer-to-peer infrastructure;proactive protocols;random topology;reactive protocols;route discovery mechanism;route discovery procedure;routing data;zone routing protocol","","1","","8","","","6-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided. Further, it achieves a fully automated signature compilation with polynomial running time and space.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501976","","Automata;Communications Society;Counting circuits;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;History;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Polynomials","","","","1","1","14","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.
