They have a small memory footprint and require few memory accesses per query and insertion, while presenting a small probability of false positive. The problem of automatic eviction of filtered addresses after a pre-configured time window is more challenging, since it requires tracking insertion times for later removal. This has been achieved in the literature by replacing the Bloom filter's vector of bits for a vector of timestamps. This approach precisely expires old items from the filter, but has a large memory footprint. We present a novel Bloom filter based data structure that features approximate information expiration. This small extra source of error allows for a more compact filter representation, thus becoming more suitable to fit in more expensive, faster memory. Additionally, our data structure is more flexible in that it allows for balancing the trade-off between filtering and expiration accuracy. Our experiments show that this method can obtain up to orders of magnitude higher overall accuracy than the time-stamp approach using the same amount of memory.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363985","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363985","","Accuracy;Data structures;Maintenance engineering;Memory management;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time measurement","Internet;data structures;information filtering;probability;telecommunication traffic","Internet;approximate information expiration;bloom filters;data structure;false positive probability;lightweight algorithm;preconfigured time window;sliding windows;time-stamp approach;traffic filtering","","0","","13","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given that these systems can roam on multiple networks, with no guarantee on security adopted on each network, including Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the mobile platforms can be beneficial in preventing cyber-attacks. One of the key problems with implementing IDS on mobile platforms is the increased power consumption. This paper presents low power circuits that implement the string matching tasks within the Snort IDS. These tasks can take up to 80% of the power consumed for Snort. The circuit presented is based on memristor crossbars and evaluate Snort rules at 0.013mW per signature. The circuits are easy to program, utilizing only two resistance states for the memristors. They are highly parallel and dense, utilizing a brute-force string matching algorithm. These circuits could additionally be utilized for other string matching operations.","","978-1-4799-4690-7","","10.1109/NAECON.2014.7045811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045811","Deep packet inspection;Snort;intrusion detection system;memristor crossbars;network security;string matching","Computer architecture;Intrusion detection;Inverters;Memristors;Mobile communication;Neurons;Pattern matching","memristor circuits;mobile computing;mobile handsets;power aware computing;security of data;string matching","IDS;Snort IDS;brute-force string matching algorithm;computing systems;cyber-attacks;memristor crossbars;mobile platforms;mobile systems;network intrusion detection system;power circuits;power consumption;power efficient architecture;string matching operations","","0","","12","","","24-27 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The parametric model can explicitly reflect the distributions of different intrusion types and handle the mixed-attribute data naturally. Based on the model, we can generate an accurate global intrusion detector with a very low cost of communication among the distributed detection sites, and no sharing of original network data is needed.

The risk model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The attacks prediction model was integrated with our autonomous cloud intrusion detection framework (ACIDF) to raise early warnings about attacks to the controller so it can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments on DARPA 2000 dataset, the proposed prediction model has successfully fired the early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack.

We investigate the impact of live virtual-machine migration on state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) techniques (namely PCA and K-means), by evaluating live migration under various attack types and intensities.

"Game Theoretic Framework for Reputation-Based Distributed Intrusion Detection","Bradai, A.; Afifi, H.","","Social Computing (SocialCom), 2013 International Conference on","20140102","2013","","","558","563","Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)have been widely used to detect malicious behaviors of nodes in heterogenous networks. Collaborative intrusion detection can be more secure with a framework using reputation aggregation as an incentive. The problem of incentives and efficiency are well known problems that can be addressed in such collaborative environment. In this paper, we propose to use game theory to improve detection and optimize intrusion detection systems used in collaboration. The main contribution of this paper is that the reputation of HIDS is evaluated before modeling the game between the HIDS and attackers. Our proposal has three phases: the first phase builds reputation evaluation between HIDS and estimates the reputation for each one. In the second phase, a proposed algorithm elects a leader using reputation value to make decisions. In the last phase, using game theory the leader decides to activate or not the HIDS for optimization reasons.","","","","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693381","False Alarm;Game Theory;Intrusion Detection;Resource Consumption","Collaboration;Game theory;Games;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Vectors","computer crime;game theory;groupware","HIDS;attackers;collaborative intrusion detection;game theory;heterogenous networks;host-based intrusion detection systems;incentives;malicious behaviors detection;reputation aggregation;reputation evaluation;reputation-based distributed intrusion detection","","0","","21","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In Naive Bayes model, the word probabilities for a class are estimated by calculating the likelihood in the entire training documents where the training and test data are split randomly into k-subsets like 2/3 for training and 1/3 for test data. In addition, it also utilizes two level hierarchy structures for training documents like features from title, keywords and content with the predefined knowledge available.

If only there is a statistical signature of unusual fluctuation or change in the network traffic an alarm will be triggered. We adapt the time series analysis of the statistical analysis result. Up bound and low bound will be defined through the analysis. The exceeding of the bound will be the signal of traffic anomaly. Another time series analysis approach also can reflect the fluctuation of network with the crossover of two indicator lines called K line and D line.

On each node, the defender can choose one of several security modes available. We try to answer the following questions: 1) What is the expected behavior of a rational attacker?; 2) What is the optimal strategy of the defender?; and 3) Can we configure the security modes on each node to discourage the attacker from launching any attacks? In this paper, we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the behavior of the attacker and the defender at the Nash equilibrium. The attacker chooses his targets in order to collect the maximum amount of data on consumers, and the defender chooses the encryption level of outbound data on each device in the AMI.

This threat becomes more severe when the worms are assumed to be polymorphic in nature - able to dynamically change their signature to elude capture. Because the method of propagation for these worms is predictable, it is possible to contain their spread through the use of honeytoken e-mail addresses in the client address book. Any e-mail received by the honeytoken address will be immediately recognized as malicious and can therefore be used to flag client machines as infected.

The hybrid approach we employ begins with the application of expert rules to reduce the dimensionality of the data, followed by an initial clustering of the data and subsequent refinement of the cluster locations using a competitive network called Learning Vector Quantization. Since Learning Vector Quantization is a nearest neighbor classifier, and new record presented to the network that lies outside a specified distance is classified as a masquerader. Thus, this system does not require anomalous records to be included in the training set","","0-7695-1212-7","","10.1109/DISCEX.2001.932193","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932193","","Authorization;Character recognition;Frequency;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Lifting equipment;Nearest neighbor searches;Robustness;Vector quantization","authorisation;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","Learning Vector Quantization;anomaly detection;command line arguments;competitive network;expert rules;hybrid approach;intrusion detection;machine learning methods;masquerader;nearest neighbor classifier;profile creation;user profiles","","14","2","39","","","2001","12 Jun 2001-14 Jun 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the major challenges for signature-based IDS is how to keep up with a large volume of incoming traffic when each packet needs to be compared with every signature in the database. When an IDS cannot keep up with the traffic flood, all it can do is to drop packets, therefore, may miss potential attacks. In this paper, we propose a dynamic model of two-layer signature-based IDS with unequal database, which can detect imminent threats with very high success rate by automatically creating and using a small efficient database, and at the same time, provide mechanisms to detect all other known threats by using a less efficient complementary database","","0-7695-2776-0","","10.1109/ITNG.2007.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4151663","","Computer worms;Data security;Databases;Floods;Humans;Internet;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data","dynamic two-layer signature-based IDS;intrusion detection systems;signature-based detection;unequal databases","","1","","15","","","2-4 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NetFlow based anomaly traffic analysis is an appropriate supplement to current signature-based NIDS.

Extra capacity can be achieved by introducing additional nodes in the network. However, the throughput of a WMN may be severely degraded due to presence of some selfish routers that avoid forwarding packets for other nodes even as they send their own traffic through the network.

The proposed QSV method is based on quick sampling of the input stream against fixed-length pattern prefixes, and on-demand verification of variable-length pattern suffixes. Patterns handled by the QSV method are required to have at least 16 bytes, and possess distinct 16-byte prefixes. The latter requirement can be fulfilled by a preprocessing procedure. The search engine uses the pipelined Aho-Corasick (P-AC) architecture developed by the first author to process 4 to 15-byte short patterns and a small number of exception cases. Our design was evaluated using the ClamAV virus database having 82,888 strings with a total size that exceeds 8 Mbyte. In terms of byte count, 99.3 percent of the pattern set is handled by the QSV method and 0.7 percent of the pattern set is handled by P-AC. A pattern with distinct 16-byte prefix only occupies up to three lookup table entries in QSV. The overall memory cost of our system is about 1.4 Mbyte, i.e., 1.4 bit per character of the ClamAV pattern set.

As rule-base IDS can gain good detecting performance, we build a genetic immune model, which is adaptive to rule-based IDS, to improve the IDS's detecting performance of new attacks. As one successful method, state transition (ST) analysis models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from initial state to a target compromised state. Using this model of recomposing the ST method to solve the low recognizing ratio problem is presented in this paper. In this model, ST method can be expressed in a double DNA chains pattern. One chain is the system state chain; the other is an action chain. The double twisting chains form a state-action sequence to represent the system state transitions. In order to still gain the recognizing performance of the regular ID systems, we use STAT rules to create the initial non-self (or expert) DNA library, and newly found attacking-rules can still be added to the library.

For reasons of ensuring privacy, we adopt the notion of l-Diversity in the course of collecting intrusion logs from organizations. Within our framework, an organization ensures the people in the center cannot discern the exact origin of any intrusion log among the other l-1 organizations. Also, it is not possible to precisely identify the classification type of an intrusion log from among other l-1 types. Within this framework, the intrusion log management center can analyze the anonymous data, since the proposed privacy preserving solution creates little information loss.

Apart from reducing the processing overhead through minimization of the feature space, the autonomous identification of such sub-groups of features can readily enable IDS's to develop classifiers that are more apt at separating normal traffic from anomalous traffic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this techniques by generating feature sets from a collection of network traffic and applying them to the training and detection phases of a payload-based IDS.

Cascading classification is in our case done by applying 2-nearest-neighbor classification. The samples which could not be predicted with 2-nearest-neighbor classification (4-6%) are further classified with a clustering approach with class priority. This clustering approach when applied in isolation under performs other approaches. However, when applied in cascading classification, it can take advantage of the reduced number of samples.

We introduced an algorithm that improves the classification for Support Vector Machines, by multiplying in the training step the instances of the underrepresented classes. We have discovered that by oversampling the instances of the anomaly, we are helping the Support Vector Machine algorithm to overcome the soft margin. As an effect, it classifies better future instances of this class of interest.","","978-1-4244-9279-4","978-1-4244-9280-0","10.1109/CINTI.2010.5672276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672276","Cost-Sensitive Classifier;Support Vector Machine;intrusion detection system;unbalanced datasets","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Support vector machine classification;Training","data mining;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","cost sensitive classification;data mining based technique;intrusion detection method;support vector machines","","1","","13","","","18-20 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance is investigated in terms of detection probability, the false alarm ratio, and the detection delay. Our results show that leaky integrate-and-fire method is quite effective at detecting anomaly in the SMTP traffic.

This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations.

T2 FL is an extension of Type-1 FL which proved to be successful in modeling and minimizing the effects of various kinds of dynamic uncertainties. In this paper, T2 FL provides a basis for robust anomaly detection and cyber security state awareness.

The increasing number of network security related incidents makes it necessary for organizations to actively protect their sensitive data with the installation of intrusion detection systems (IDS). Detecting intrusion in distributed network from outside network segment as well as from inside is a difficult problem. Intrusion detection system must analyze a large volume of data while not placing a significant added load on the monitoring systems and networks. The deficiency of centralized intrusion detection systems leads the idea of mobile agents. In an agent based IDS idea, there is no central station, therefore no central point of failure. Agents can detect and take predefined actions against malicious activity. The system shows a superior performance compared to central sniffing IDS techniques, and saves network resources compared to other distributed IDSs that activate too many sniffers causing bottlenecks in the network. This is one of the major motivations to use the distributed model based on mobile agent platform. This paper presents survey of distributed intrusion detection system based on mobile agents.

We develop an effective spam zombie detection system named SPOT by monitoring outgoing messages of a network. SPOT is designed based on a powerful statistical tool called Sequential Probability Ratio Test, which has bounded false positive and false negative error rates. Our evaluation studies based on a two- month email trace collected in a large U.S. campus network show that SPOT is an effective and efficient system in automatically detecting compromised machines in a network. For example, among the 440 internal IP addresses observed in the email trace, SPOT identifies 132 of them as being associated with compromised machines. Out of the 132 IP addresses identified by SPOT, 126 can be either independently confirmed (110) or highly likely (16) to be compromised.

Because of their complex signaling and relatively limited bandwidth, these 3G networks are generally more vulnerable than their wireline counterparts, thus making them fertile ground for new attacks. In this paper, we identify and study a novel denial of service (DoS) attack, called signaling attack, that exploits the unique vulnerabilities of the signaling/control plane in 3G wireless networks. Using simulations driven by real traces, we are able to demonstrate the impact of a signaling attack. Specifically, we show how a well-timed low-volume signaling attack can potentially overload the control plane and detrimentally affect the key elements in a 3G wireless infrastructure. The low-volume nature of the signaling attack allows it to avoid detection by existing intrusion detection algorithms, which are often signature or volume-based. As a counter-measure, we present and evaluate an online early detection algorithm based on the statistical CUSUM method. Through the use of extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm is robust and can identify an attack in its inception, before significant damage is done.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215735","","3G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Resource management;Signal detection;Signal generators;Signal processing;Wireless networks","3G mobile communication;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","3G wireless network;CDMA2000 standard;UMTS standard;denial of service;intrusion detection algorithm;signaling DoS attack detection;statistical CUSUM method;trace-driven simulation","","18","1","28","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many of these anomaly detection systems have low detection accuracy when the training is not sufficient. This occurs because the normal behavior data obtained through training on one machine cannot be used for detection on another machine. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system that shares normal behavior data between multiple machines. In the proposed system, normal behavior data obtained on each machine is accumulated in a server and the integrated data is distributed to each machine.This system improves the detection accuracy by integrating the data used for anomaly detection on each machine. The proposed system not only provides a straightforward algorithm for integration, but also two improved algorithms, namely, the majority algorithm and the similarity algorithm. The proposed system was implemented on the Linux operating system, and its behavior was compared experimentally with that of an existing system.","","978-0-7695-3836-5","","10.1109/CIT.2009.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5329496","intrusion detection systems;security","Application software;Computer science;Databases;Event detection;Fault detection;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Linux;Monitoring;Operating systems","Linux;database management systems;operating systems (computers);security of data","Linux operating system;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;normal behavior databases;system call sequences","","1","","11","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, system events tracking lacks completeness of intrusion propagation, while dynamic taint tracking is not feasible to be deployed due to significant runtime overhead. Thus, we propose production environment damage assessment (PEDA), a systematic approach to do postmortem intrusion analysis for production workload servers. PEDA replays the “has-been-infected” execution with high fidelity on a separate analyzing instrumentation platform to conduct the heavy workload analysis. Though the replayed execution runs atop the instrumentation platform (i.e., binary-translation-based virtual machine), PEDA allows the first-run execution to run atop the hardware-assisted virtual machine to ensure minimum runtime overhead. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the PEDA system with a runtime overhead as low as 5%.

Unfortunately, system administrators neither can keep up with the pace that an IDS is delivering alerts, nor can they react upon these within adequate time limits. Automatic response systems have to take over that task. In case of an identified intrusion, these components have to initiate appropriate actions to counter emerging threats. Most current intrusion response systems (IRSs) utilize static mappings to determine adequate response actions in reaction to detected intrusions. The problem with this approach is its inherent inflexibility. Countermeasures (such as changes of firewall rules) often do not only defend against the detected attack but may also have negative effects on legitimate users of the network and its services. To prevent a situation where a response action causes more damage that the actual attack, a mechanism is needed that compares the severity of an attack to the effects of a possible response mechanism. In this paper, we present a network model and an algorithm to evaluate the impact of response actions on the entities of a network. This allows the IRS to select the response among several alternatives which fulfills the security requirements and has a minimal negative effect on legitimate users.","1063-9527","0-7695-1828-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176302","","Computer bugs;Computer security;Counting circuits;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Watches;Web and internet services","security of data","IDS;IRS;automated intrusion response mechanism impact evaluation;countermeasures;emerging threats;firewall rules;intrusion detection systems;intrusion response systems;system administrators","","19","","15","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wide spreading nature of worm will cause the network packet to be transfer massively over the network and cause the substantial increase in frequency. The threshold that detects the worm activity pattern will adjust accordingly to the increase of network traffic to accommodate high speed large network traffic.

Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs) can provide some of the functionality of NIDSs but with limitations. HIDSs cannot perform a network-wide analysis and can be subverted if a host is compromised. We propose an approach to intrusion detection that combines HIDS, NIDS, and a version of IPsec that encrypts the header and the body of IP packets separately (""Two-Zone IPsec""). We show that all of the network events currently detectable by the Snort NIDS on unencrypted network traffic are also detectable on encrypted network traffic using this approach.

The novelty of our approach results from the application of techniques used in bioinformatics for a pair-wise sequence alignment to compare the monitored session with past user behavior. Our algorithm uses a semiglobal alignment and a unique scoring system to measure similarity between a sequence of commands produced by a potential intruder and the user signature, which is a sequence of commands collected from a legitimate user. We tested this algorithm on the standard intrusion data collection set. As discussed, the results of the test showed that the described algorithm yields a promising combination of intrusion detection rate and false positive rate, when compared to published intrusion detection algorithms.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254307","","Automata;Bioinformatics;Computer networks;Computer security;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protection;Testing","computer crime;message authentication;pattern matching","bioinformatics;finite state automata;hidden Markov models;intrusion data collection set;intrusion detection;legitimate user signature;masquerading detection;pair-wise sequence alignment;pattern matching;scoring system;semiglobal alignment","","22","6","18","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To cope up with the requirements of continuous, heavy, incoming network traffic analysis, the classification model should be very fast. Naive Bayes is one of the classification models that predicts very fast due to the less complexity functioning of it. Fast prediction is also the reason for a lot work done in recent years using Bayesian approach. This paper proposes, a new hybrid model that ensembles Naive Bayes (statistical) and Decision Table Majority (rule based) approaches. The experimental results show better performance in detection rate as well false positive rate with reasonable prediction time.","","978-1-4673-2148-8","","10.1109/ICDSE.2012.6282310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6282310","decision table majority;hybrid approach;network intrusion detection system","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Probes;Training","Bayes methods;data mining;decision tables;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;security of data","Bayesian approach;IDS;classification model;data mining based hybrid network intrusion detection model;decision table majority;ensembles naive Bayes;malicious activity detection;network traffic analysis;rule based approach","","1","","17","","","18-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a new algorithm for the correlation of alerts generated by Network Intrusion Detection Systems. It is specifically oriented to face multistep attacks where multiple intrusion activities belonging to the same attack scenario are performed within a small time window. This algorithm takes as its input the security alerts generated by a NIDS and, through a pseudo-bayesian alert correlation, is able to identify those that are likely to belong to the same multistep attack scenario. The proposed approach is completely unsupervised and applicable to security alerts generated by any kind of NIDS.","","978-1-4577-1034-6","","10.1109/CSS.2011.6058565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058565","","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Indexes;Intrusion detection","computer crime;computer network security","NIDS;correlated network intrusion alert;false alarm;information systems attack;pseudoBayesian alert correlation","","2","","12","","","8-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, this paper presents critically investigations of alert swamping and redundancy and how we have lessened them using a simple clustering method.

By analyzing known web attacks, we find out that each one has its own behavior. Vestiges of their behavior could be detected in non-body parts of the HTTP Protocol. Such information can be used to verify web alerts generated by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Web Intrusion Detection Systems (Web IDSs). In this paper, we propose a method to verify web alerts generated by mentioned sensors. The goal of the alert verification component is to eliminate or tag alerts that do not represent successful attacks. Our approach is based on analyzing HTTP Transaction metadata, including Request method, Request Headers, Status Code, and Response Headers. We implemented an alert verification module, reconfigured ModSecurity, modified a subset of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and developed knowledge-base of web attack vectors to evaluate our method. We show that our approach significantly reduces false and non-relevant alerts with quite low processing overhead, thus enhances the quality of the results.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994044","HTTP Protocol;Intrusion Detection System;Web Application Firewall;alert verification;web attack","Accuracy;Firewalls (computing);Intrusion detection;Knowledge based systems;Protocols;Web servers","Internet;computer network security;hypermedia;meta data;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;HTTP transaction metadata analysis;OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set;WAF;Web IDS;Web application firewalls;Web attack;Web attack vector knowledge-base;Web driven alert verification;Web intrusion detection systems;Web server;alert verification module;reconfigured ModSecurity;request headers;request method;status code","","0","","20","","","3-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary simulation goal is to ensure that B-SIPS does not negatively affect external applications in the network, as any drastic throughput degradation would severely lower the probability of successful B-SIPS deployments. The research goal is accomplished goal by modeling the Virginia Tech wireless-cum-wired network and simulating various network sizes, external network loads, and B-SIPS application transmission settings. This research demonstrates that under reasonable network loads the B-SIPS application had little to no effect on the throughput of external applications. Additionally, the 1 second default transmission rate for B-SIPS was determined to cause the least application degradation for external applications and ensured B-SIPS reports were successfully transmitted in a saturated network environment. Next, the detection capabilities of B-SIPS are examined by conducting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and blended attacks against mobile devices. The ability of B-SIPS to detect multi-vector attacks provides application users with the ability to conserve battery charge life and retain device service significantly longer than devices undergoing similar attacks and not utilizing B-SIPS. The attacks used in this portion of the research should be applied to future network simulations of B-SIPS. These simulations will quantify network throughput and device battery usage in large scale network deployments that are, and are not, using B-SIPS.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-3450-3","","10.1109/HICSS.2009.394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755621","","Batteries;Bluetooth;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Protection;Research initiatives;Sensor systems;Testing;Throughput","Bluetooth;security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Battery-Sensing Intrusion Protection System research;Bluetooth;Wi-Fi;battery-sensing intrusion protection system;device battery usage;mobile devices;multi-vector attacks;network deployment validation;network simulations;network throughput;saturated network environment;throughput degradation;transmission rate","","0","","19","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current practice is that NMS and IDS are independent to each other in a network. There is little integration and information sharing between the two.
