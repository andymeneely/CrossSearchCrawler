To do that, we introduce two anomaly intrusion detection methods based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This approach searches for those vectors in the underlying space that best discriminate among users' profile classes. The discrimination rules are based on nonlinear combinations of the observed users' profiles, called discriminant factors. This new approach provides for the ability to learn and later determine whether a new profile does or does not correspond to those of known users. Unlike many researchers we used realistic data to learn the behaviors of four students' classes. After that we apply KFDA and KPCA to get an appropriate discrimination between the student classes. Thus, one can easily determine if a new student is legitimate or not by projecting its profile onto the profile subspace. Simulations show that our approaches outperform those used in [1].","","","","10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7232998","Anomaly intrusion detection;Audit trail analysis;Intrusion detection;Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis;Kernel Principal Component Analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrices;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","data analysis;principal component analysis;security of data;vectors","KFDA;KPCA;anomaly intrusion detection method;data analysis method;discriminant factor;discrimination rule;kernel fisher discriminant analysis;kernel principal component analysis;vector","","0","","13","","","25-27 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A real-world environment could be different from the environment designed for a testbed. The results obtained, from such testbeds, may not be accurate and reliable. Hence, a quantitative and metrics based evaluation of IDSs is desired. We propose testbed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (TIDeS), that allows a user to select the best IDS for a specific customized environment. A quantitative analysis is provided by TIDeS, using fuzzy logic, under varying network loads. We also propose robust metrics to evaluate an IDS.

The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets or timing jitter. Such evasion techniques cause most of the previous timing-based detection algorithms to fail. In this paper, we address these issues and devise a methodology to defeat these counter measures. Our algorithm uses modified association rule mining to detect stepping-stones. It is based on finding as many matched pairs of packets as possible within the fixed length intervals and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the matched rate. This algorithm allows checking multiple connections at once and therefore greatly increasing the efficiency compared to others. We examine the selected parameters and provide different trade-offs among false rates. Our experiments report a very good performance with very high detection rate and low false detection rate when using carefully selected parameter values.","","978-1-4244-3572-2","978-0-7695-3564-7","10.1109/ARES.2009.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066459","Stepping-stone;connection chain;data mining;intrusion detection;network security","Association rules;Computer security;Cryptography;Data mining;Delay;Delta modulation;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing;Timing jitter","Internet;data mining;security of data;telecommunication network routing","Internet;evasion technique;false detection rate;modified association rule mining;network intrusion detection system;network routing;stepping-stone connection detection","","0","","13","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lightweight IDSs are small, powerful, and flexible enough to be used as permanent elements of the network security infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for building lightweight IDS based on two different approaches. The first approach is using a features selection approach by applying fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function (Fuzzy ESVDF) algorithm. This approach is able to improve system efficiency. The second approach is using IDS classification scheme. The IDS classification scheme divides the detection process into four types according to the TCP/IP network model (application layer IDS, transport layer IDS, network layer IDS, and link layer IDS). This IDS classification scheme enhances an organizationpsilas ability to detect most types of attack (improving system accuracy and generality). Also, it improves IDS scalability and extendibility. To design the proposed system, several experiments have been conducted, and they indicate that the proposed lightweight IDS can deliver satisfactory system performance.","","978-1-4244-5334-4","978-0-7695-3823-5","10.1109/CSE.2009.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283334","Intrusion Detection Systems;Support Decision Function;features classification.;features ranking;features selection","Data engineering;Fuzzy sets;IP networks;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Scalability;System performance;System testing;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;support vector machines;telecommunication security;transport protocols","TCP/IP network model;application layer IDS;feature selection;fuzzy enhanced support vector decision function algorithm;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS classification scheme;link layer IDS;network layer IDS;network security;transport layer IDS","","1","","25","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) that models normal behaviors with hidden Markov models (HMM) and attempts to detect intrusions by noting significant deviations from the models. Among several soft computing techniques neural network and fuzzy logic are incorporated into the system to achieve robustness and flexibility. The self-organizing map (SOM) determines the optimal measures of audit data and reduces them into appropriate size for efficient modeling by HMM.

In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the Web service and a large set of SQL/XPath injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.","","978-1-4244-5183-8","978-0-7695-3811-2","10.1109/SCC.2009.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283945","","Data security;Informatics;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Relational databases;Runtime;Stress;Testing;Web services","SQL;Web services;program testing;security of data","SQL injection vulnerabilities;Web services;XPath injection vulnerabilities;security vulnerabilities","","13","","23","","","21-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection.

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation.

In this paper, to solve some problems in applying DST, a hybrid approach of RST and DST is proposed. Firstly, to obtain basic probability assignment (BPA) of evidence theory for all evidences, a novel method of getting evidences and objective BPA based on attribute importance is presented. The attribute simplification algorithm is established to eliminate redundant evidences and establish the final combined evidences.

Its major challenge comes from malicious attacks, which cannot be handled by traditional security mechanisms, such as authorization, access control, encryption, etc. Although there existed some intrusion detection systems, current researches on intrusion detection are still insufficient in accuracy and efficiency for two reasons: firstly, most of them implement malicious transaction detection only by matching samples with predefined patterns; secondly, most current researches mainly resort to semantic analyzing or even only manual interventions to judge the malicious attacks. Inspired by the replication technique, we propose and implement a novel logical replication-based intrusion detection solution for CSCW system in this paper.

Honeypots are a tool supporting that task - they collect malware samples for analysis. Unfortunately, existing honeypots concentrate on malware that spreads over networks, thus missing any malware that does not use a network for propagation. A popular network-independent technique for malware to spread is copying itself to USB flash drives. In this article we present Ghost, a new kind of honeypot for such USB malware. It detects malware by simulating a removable device in software, thereby tricking malware into copying itself to the virtual device. We explain the concept in detail and evaluate it using samples of wide-spread malware. We conclude that this new approach works reliably even for sophisticated malware, thus rendering the concept a promising new idea.","","978-1-4673-3087-9","978-1-4673-3088-6","10.1109/CRISIS.2012.6378948","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378948","","Ash;Computers;Internet;Malware;Operating systems;Universal Serial Bus","computer network security;invasive software;peripheral interfaces","Ghost;USB flash drives;USB malware;USB storage devices;honeypot;malicious software analysis;malicious software detection;network-independent technique;removable storage device simulation;virtual device","","1","","20","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An attacker may spoof the identity of legitimate users before implementing more serious attacks. Most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that employ multi-layer approach to help towards mitigating network attacks, offer high detection accuracy rate and low numbers of false alarms. Dempster-Shafer theory has been used with the purpose of combining beliefs of different metric measurements across multiple layers. However, an important step to be investigated remains open; this is to find an automatic and self-adaptive process of Basic Probability Assignment (BPA). This paper describes a novel BPA methodology able to automatically adapt its detection capabilities to the current measured characteristics, with a light weight process of generating a baseline profile of normal utilisation and without intervention from the IDS administrator.

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved “cause and effect” model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph. The proposed system is evaluated using DARPA 2000 and collected real life data sets. The results have shown an improvement in respect to detection rate and reduction of false positives.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-6695-5","","10.1109/AINA.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474796","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;multi-stage attack","Data mining;Data security;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Libraries;Mars;Redundancy;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data","DARPA 2000;alerts correlation techniques;attack patterns;detection techniques;extensional consequences parameters;knowledge-based model;low-level processing capacity;multistage attack recognition system;network intrusion detection systems;signature-based NIDS;signature-matching","","3","","22","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets.

The first contribution lies in reducing the false alarm rate of the attack detection in an agent-based architecture by using honeypot network as the closer level of investigation. The connection is retrieved to the original destination in case of false alarm recognition, while the actions are hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS. The second contribution applies the game theoretic analysis in the sense that the contributing agents are led to perform the best they could in order to achieve their goals. The Shaply value is computed to find the actual contribution of each agent in the coalition he belongs to. The equilibrium point is found and consequently the winner coalition is formed.

Although naive selfish strategies based on dropping data packets are readily detected, more sophisticated strategies that manipulate ad hoc routing protocols present a greater challenge. In this work we develop a method to distinguish selfish peers from cooperative ones based solely on local observations of AODV routing protocol behavior. Our approach uses the finite state machine model of locally observed AODV actions to build up a statistical description of the behavior of each neighbor. We apply a series of well-known statistical tests to features derived from this description to partition the set neighboring nodes into a cooperative and selfish class. Simulation results for a non-mobile ad hoc network show that our approach can detect two different types of routing manipulation while maintaining a low rate of false positives.","1087-4089","0-7695-2509-1","","10.1109/ISPAN.2005.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1575855","","Ad hoc networks;Automata;Automatic testing;Bandwidth;Computer science;Data mining;Intelligent networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;finite state machines;routing protocols;statistical testing","AODV routing protocol;finite state machine;free-rider;nonmobile ad hoc network;reputation mechanism;selfish peer;selfish routing behavior;statistical description;statistical test","","5","","15","","","7-9 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the currently existing intrusion detection algorithms designed for these networks are insecure, inefficient, and have high rates of false positives. In this paper, a new approach has been proposed to bring out the complementary relationship between key distribution and intrusion detection for developing an intrusion detection protocol for ad hoc networks. The redundancy of routing information in ad-hoc networks is utilized to develop a highly reliable protocol that works even in presence of transient network partitioning and Byzantine failure of nodes. The proposed mechanism is fully cooperative, and thus it is more robust as the vulnerabilities of the election algorithms used for choosing the subset of nodes for cooperation are absent.

The approach taken is to assume that the defender's goal is to thwart attackers by enact optimal tactical responses. It is then shown that, even in an idealized environment, the defender has no guarantee that the correlation system's estimates of the enacted attacks are correct. A theoretical path always exists by which the attacker can influence the contents of the correlation system's low-level alert clusters. As these low-level clusters form the basis of all higher level analyses, this is sufficient to show that the attacker has influence over the tactical assessments reported by correlation systems. In essence, the attackers can cause the defender to mis-correlate an attack's generated INFOSEC alerts in a manner which can go undetected and is to the attacker's advantage. This capability is shown to hinge on there being attacks whose identification requires the analysis of shared alerts (i.e., alerts generated by two or more distinct attacks).","","0-7803-9427-5","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532055","","Councils;Fasteners;Game theory;Large-scale systems;Performance analysis;Pressing;Production;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","military communication;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security","network security;standard alert correlation systems;tactical assessments;timing characteristics","","0","","23","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses.

However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected. The proposed framework is evaluated analytically and implemented under TOSSIM simulator.

However, current methods detect only when a user's aggregate behavior is intruding, not when specific actions have deviated from expectation. In this paper, we introduce a method called specialized network anomaly detection (SNAD) to detect such events. SNAD assembles the community of users that access a particular subject and assesses if similarities of the community with and without a certain user are sufficiently different. We present a theoretical basis and perform an extensive empirical evaluation with the access logs of two distinct environments: those of a large electronic health record system (6,015 users, 130,457 patients and 1,327,500 accesses) and the editing logs of Wikipedia (2,388,955 revisors, 55,200 articles and 6,482,780 revisions). We compare SNAD with several competing methods and demonstrate it is significantly more effective: on average it achieves 20-30% greater area under an ROC curve.","","978-1-4577-0082-8","","10.1109/ISI.2011.5984061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5984061","","Analytical models;Atmospheric measurements;Automatic voltage control;Electronic publishing;Intrusion detection;Medical services","groupware;information systems;security of data;social networking (online)","CIS;ROC curve;SNAD;Wikipedia;access logs;anomalous insider actions detection;broad access privileges;collaborative environments;collaborative information systems;complex dynamic systems;detect threats;editing logs;electronic health record system;extensive empirical evaluation;insider threat detection models;leveraging social networks;shared tasks;specialized network anomaly detection","","1","","28","","","10-12 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and non-worm traffic. We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain, however, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the power spectral density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding spectral flatness measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from non-worm traffic.

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3","978-1-4244-6939-0","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 36th Annual 2002 International Carnahan Conference on","20021210","2002","","","191","197","Intrepid MicroTrack is the first leaky coaxial cable sensor to utilize FM CW radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. The first leaky coaxial cable sensor, introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, used pulse radar techniques to detect and locate intruders. Since then, there have been numerous papers on CW leaky cable sensors that detect, but do not locate intruders. Like Southwest Microwave's MicroPoint, the acoustic cable sensor introduced at the 1994 Carnahan conference, MicroTrack offers several new features, including the ability to precisely locate intruders. These features greatly improve sensor performance. This paper describes the technology and its broad range of applications including buried, surface and barrier mounted. MicroTrack is an ultra wide band (UWB) HF terrain-following radar. FM CW radar techniques are well known and have been widely used in radio altimeters and police radar for many years. However, it is only with the advent of low cost direct digital synthesis (DDS) chips, high speed and high resolution analog to digital converters (ADC) and digital processing components that it is now practical to apply FM CW radar techniques to leaky cables. MicroTrack uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to translate the swept frequency response into precise target location. The frequency diversity associated with the ultra wide bandwidth assures uniform detection along the length of the sensor cable.

The real-time efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection is greatly influenced by the scale of signature database and the approach of intrusion data analysis. In this paper, a typical set method is provided to compress the normal signature database. Using the data set of UNM CERT sendmail for testing, the feasibility of typical set method is validated, and a proper rate of typical set for intrusion detection is proposed. Meanwhile, the LSM (Linux Security Modules) framework is presented to hook system calls and other audit data from operation system to build intrusion detection system signature database and identify intrusion activity. A system service process oriented detection idea is also introduced to make the intrusion detection more pertinent and accurate.

Most existing IDS and IPS techniques introduce high false positive and false negative rates, which need to be eliminated or reduced considerably. This paper will concentrate on network packets behavior leading to network-based intrusion detection. It will employ anomaly detection as its analysis strategy. In the field of signal analysis, the methods of wavelet transform have gotten wide application because of its unique merit. That idea will be tapped in this paper. The self-similarity property of real network traffic will be used together with the signal detection abilities of wavelets in detecting attacks. The technique used here will also try to reduce the effectiveness of distributed attacks, which deny authorized users access to system resources. Securing of all network security data, which is an important limitation to existing IDS and IPS is ensured by this technique.","","978-1-4244-1109-2","978-1-4244-1110-8","10.1109/ISCE.2007.4382163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4382163","","Communications technology;Data security;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Risk management;Signal analysis;Signal resolution;Telecommunication traffic;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","computer network management;packet radio networks;security of data;telecommunication security;wavelet transforms","distributed attacks;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention systems;network intrusion detection;network packets;network security data;network traffic;self-similarity;wavelet transform","","1","","10","","","20-23 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system is trained using a 66% of randomly selected connections in as a subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection data set. The training model is created by a trained classifier and then used to classify the remaining 34% subset of the KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset in order to report on the effectiveness of the model. The results show that based on a selected set of features extracted using subset evaluation algorithm for classifiers and a best-first search mechanism, that decision tree algorithm J48 based on C4.5 provides 99.95% of correctly classified instances and is better than the Naïve Bayes technique. Also found was that false positives using Naïve Bayes are high for Probing and Remote to Local attack categories.

Dramatic advances in computing and communications technology during the past few years have redirected the focus of data processing from the computing center to the terminals in individual offices and homes. The result is that managers must now monitor security on a more widely dispersed level. These changes are continuing to accelerate, making the security manager's job increasingly difficult. In this paper a better solution for Information Security management has been proposed by designing PrISM (Preventive Information Security Management). PrISM aims to develop and deploy an indigenous Information Security Management System (ISMS) with intrusion prevention capabilities. The objective is to develop an ISMS with appropriate security assurance controls and risk handling processes. This will provide best protection of critical assets against information warfare attacks. The task has been planned by performing reverse engineering of Open Source Security Information Management (OSSIM) system.

This is a main cause of high false rates and inaccurate detection rates in IDS. In this paper, we propose a new approach named quantitative intrusion intensity assessment (QIIA). QIIA exploits feature selection and proximity metrics computation so that it provides intrusion (or normal) quantitative intensity value. It is capable of representing how an instance of audit data is proximal to intrusion or normal in the form of a numerical value. Prior to applying QIIA to audit data, we perform feature selection and parameters optimization of detection model in order not only to decrease the overheads to process audit data but also to enhance detection rates. QIIA then is performed using random forest (RF) and it generates proximity metrics which represent the intrusion intensity in a numerical way. The numerical values are used to determine whether unknown audit data is intrusion or normal. We carry out several experiments on KDD 1999 dataset and show the evaluation results.","","978-0-7695-3849-5","","10.1109/PRDC.2009.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368241","Feature Selection;Intrusion Detection System;Paramter Optimizations;Proximity Metrics;Random Forests","Aerospace engineering;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Radio frequency;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication computing;USA Councils","security of data;software metrics","KDD 1999 dataset;feature selection;inaccurate detection rates;intrusion detection system;proximity metrics;proximity metrics computation;quantitative intensity value;quantitative intrusion intensity assessment;random forest","","0","","20","","","16-18 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If such an attack can be found, it implies that the target detector is vulnerable against mimicry attacks. In this work, we emphasize that there are two components of a buffer overflow attack: the preamble and the exploit. Although the attacker can modify the exploit component easily, the attacker may not be able to prevent preamble from generating anomalous behavior since during preamble stage, the attacker does not have full control. Previous work on mimicry attacks considered an attack to completely evade detection, if the exploit raises no alarms. On the other hand, in this work, we investigate the source of anomalies in both the preamble and the exploit components against two anomaly detectors that monitor four vulnerable UNIX applications. Our experiment results show that preamble can be a source of anomalies, particularly if it is lengthy and anomalous.","","978-0-7695-3390-2","","10.1109/PST.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641288","Information hiding;anomaly detection;mimicry attacks;vulnerability testing","Assembly;Buffer overflow;Computer science;Databases;Detectors;Gain control;Information analysis;Monitoring;Privacy;System testing","object detection;security of data","UNIX applications;anomalous behavior;buffer overflow attack;mimicry attacks;target detector","","2","","18","","","1-3 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
