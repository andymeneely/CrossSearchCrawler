The results indicated a serious lack of accuracy in current OSD tools. This thesis proposes a new approach to OS discovery which addresses the limitations of existing tools and leads to a more flexible, less intrusive, and much more accurate tool. Moreover, unlike existing OSD tools which are completely ad hoc, our approach is formal and follows the principles of diagnosis problem solving. This formalism allows us to: (a) characterize the complexity of OSD; (b) use well-tested algorithms and (c) benefit from numerous possible extensions. To fully address the needs of OSD, we generalize the theory of diagnosis with a query-based extension. This extension leads to a spectrum of test selection algorithms to solve each query.","1542-1201","978-1-4673-0267-8","978-1-4673-0268-5","10.1109/NOMS.2012.6212000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6212000","","Accuracy;Computers;Context;Engines;Knowledge based systems;Operating systems;Security","operating systems (computers);problem solving;program diagnostics;program testing;query processing","OSD complexity;diagnosis problem solving principles;diagnosis theory;operating system discovery tools;query-based extension;test selection algorithms","","2","","16","","","16-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis","Xinming Ou; Rajagopalan, S.R.; Sakthivelmurugan, S.","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2009. ACSAC '09. Annual","20100115","2009","","","494","503","Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3919-5","","10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706","intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;security of data","Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty","","3","","22","","","7-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One example is the filtering-and-refinement approach, a new general two stage technique for more efficient and effective anomaly detection. This paper will try to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the classical techniques presented but as we will see the results are completely dependent on the data sets that are analyzed. We will emphasize on efficiency, robustness and accuracy. We will also try to demonstrate a hybrid approach obtained by combining the filtering-and-refinement method with the DBSCAN algorithm. In our experiments we pursued to compare the performance of the normal DBSCAN algorithm with the performance of the hybrid one.

Therefore, requested time intervals and requested IPs with text mining are used for user profiles. Users in the network are clustered by calculating optimum k and threshold parameters of KNN algorithm. Finally, over these clusters, new requests are separated as outlier or normal by different threshold values with different priority weight values and average similarities with different priority weight values.","","978-1-4244-9287-9","","10.1109/WCSE.2010.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718362","Outlier detection;k-nearest neighbor clustering and classification;network security and similarity measurement","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Data warehouses;IP networks;Intrusion detection","IP networks;computer network security;data mining;data warehouses;pattern clustering","data mining paradigms;data warehouse;different priority weight values;double-sided control mechanism;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;network security;outlier detection","","0","","9","","","19-20 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evading these attacks has created a lot of attention from researchers. A number of monitoring and filtering devices have been developed to verify the authenticity of the packets based on the packet payload data in intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the methods used for IDS cannot be deployed in DDoS filters since in DDoS attacks, a lot of packets arrive in a short span of time and deriving packet payload patterns become cumbersome with these IDS algorithms. This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm. This three-level filter was tested in the ANTS active network tool kit with the 1999 DARPA IDS dataset as the back end. Results validate the proposed scheme's efficiency and the time complexity of the filter proposed is smaller than IDS payload scanning methodologies.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809140","ANTS;Anomaly detection;Distributed Denial of Service attack;Eigen Vector;Payload modeling;String matching","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Filtering;Filters;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;message authentication;string matching;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;active network;distributed denial-of-service attack;eigen vector;flooding attack;intrusion detection system;optimal string matching algorithm;packet authenticity;packet payload data;payload driven security model","","1","1","11","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, a divide-and-conquer method is used. Decision tree and ESN are combined to decrease the complexity of the classifier and make the classifier more comprehensible and more interpretable.

Few methods consider to normalize the attributes but the question of which normalization method is more effective still remains. In this paper, we introduce four different schemes of attribute normalization to preprocess the data for anomaly intrusion detection. Three methods, k-NN, PCA as well as SVM, are then employed on the normalized data for comparison of the detection results. KDD Cup 1999 data are used to evaluate the normalization schemes and the detection methods. The systematical evaluation results show that the process of attribute normalization improves a lot the detection performance. The statistical normalization scheme is the best choice for detection if the data set is large.","","978-1-4244-5403-7","","10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381578","Intrusion detection;PCA;anomaly detection;data normalization","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer network security;principal component analysis;support vector machines","PCA;SVM;anomaly intrusion detection;attribute normalization;computer network security;k-NN;network intrusion detection;principal component analysis;statistical normalization scheme;support vector machines","","5","","26","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, Internet consists of network management units (NMUs). It would be better if several nearby surrounding NMUs can collaboratively guard and protect their important surrounded neighbor. In this article, we propose an intrusion forecast and traceback system (IFTS) based on union defense environment. IFTS monitors network forwarding traffic, thus forecasting malicious behaviors for its neighbor NMD, called protected NMU (P-NMU).

To improve the speed and the storage-efficiency, complex regexs are decomposed into simpler subexpressions, where each subexpression can fire one or more instructions. Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

To extract the normal behavior as a profile, conventional data mining techniques are widely applied to a finite audit data set. However, these approaches can only model the static behavior of a user in the audit data set. This drawback can be overcome by viewing the continuous activities of a user as an audit data stream. This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm, which continuously models a data stream. A set of features is used to represent the characteristics of an activity. For each feature, the clusters of feature values corresponding to activities observed so far in an audit data stream are identified by the proposed clustering algorithm for data streams. As a result, without maintaining any historical activity of a user physically, new activities of the user can be continuously reflected to the on-going result of clustering.","","0-7695-2297-1","","10.1109/SERA.2005.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563165","","Clustering algorithms;Communications technology;Computer crime;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Security;Virtual manufacturing","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;audit data set;data mining techniques;data stream clustering","","1","1","17","","","11-13 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L. The feature selection enables the classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification. The multiple classifiers are used in four layers for detecting the four types of attack classes. The classification rate of above 99% is obtained.

Its principle is to group all data features according to information gain, and then to choose the feature subset with the best classification accuracy according to SVM algorithm(the classification accuracy of SVM is defined as intrusion Detection accuracy).

This observation has given rise to the long-standing question, ""why six?"" accompanied by related questions regarding the conditions under which six may (not) be appropriate. This paper addresses the ""why six"" issue by presenting an evaluation framework for mapping out stide's effective operating space and by identifying conditions that contribute to detection capability, particularly detection blindness.

"Countering Network-Centric Insider Threats through Self-Protective Autonomic Rule Generation","Sibai, Faisal M.; Menasce, D.","","Software Security and Reliability (SERE), 2012 IEEE Sixth International Conference on","20120806","2012","","","273","282","Insider threats are a growing problem in today's organizations. Detecting such attacks is especially challenging because most system owners and system administrators use networks to remotely manage the systems they are responsible for. In previous work, we introduced the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) that has a scalable architecture to deal with such threats. This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic. The paper discusses how various high level rules (HLR) can detect new unwanted behaviors without any user intervention. Experiments conducted on three types of applications -- FTP, database, and Web -- show that the enhanced AVPS can detect known and unknown insider attacks through high level rules and process automation.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","","10.1109/SERE.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258317","Insider threat;autonomic computing;network security;privileged user;self-protection","Automation;Databases;Humans;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers","","","","0","","43","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed SSF algorithm uses a tiny data structure, and is light-computational and cache- resident. It can be implemented efficiently in a software-based platform. Experimental results show that with Snort's patterns, the computation time of the SSF with the AC algorithm to process the Defcon9 trace is only one-third to half of that of a pure AC algorithm.

Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: ""Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise"". To do so, we will take the language which is realized by Jonathan Rouzauld Cornabas to modelize the system's entities to protect. This paper represents only the idea on which we will base on, in order to design an effective IDS in the operating system running in user space.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237318","intrusion detection system;realtime system;security;security properties","Access control;Computational modeling;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","cryptography;firewalls;information systems;operating systems (computers)","IDS;anomaly approach;cryptography;firewalls;information assurance;information systems;intrusion detection system;misuse approach;operating system;security properties","","0","","","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most important features of security devices such as IDSs, AVSs and D-MASs, is how accurately they identify and document threats. By nature, these security devices are difficult to test since they are test systems themselves. The attackers are the testers trying to find test cases that cannot be identified by these systems. Consequently, thorough testing models are required by developers to assess the accuracy of D-MASs, an area in which very little theoretical and empirical work exists. In this paper, we lay out the basis of D-MASs accuracy assessment and we present an evaluation of eight of these systems. We propose test coverage criteria, oracle types and specifications to assess the accuracy of D-MASs.

Unauthorized interactive backdoors to a network belong to the most dangerous class of intrusions (D. Zamboni et al., 1998). These backdoors are usually installed by root-kits, to hide the system compromise activity. They are a gateway to launch exploits, gain super-user access to hosts in the internal network and use the attacked network as a stepping stone to attack other networks. In this research, we have developed software and done statistical analysis to assess and prevent such situations.","","0-7803-7808-3","","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232410","","Automation;Computer worms;Electronic mail;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Intserv networks;Linux;Network servers;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic","alarm systems;authorisation;computer crime;computer networks;network servers;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","alarm filtering;alert report;automatic backdoor analysis;false alert reduction;integrated service checker;network intrusion detection system;statistical analysis;super-user access;system compromise activity;unauthorized SSH server;unauthorized interactive backdoor","","0","","7","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intruders can exploit the large amount of cloud resources for their attacks. Most of the current security technologies do not provide the essential security features for cloud systems such as early warnings about future ongoing attacks, autonomic prevention actions, and risk measure. This paper discusses the integration of these three features to our Autonomic Cloud Intrusion Detection Framework (ACIDF). The early warnings are signaled through a new finite State Hidden Markov prediction model that captures the interaction between the attackers and cloud assets. The risk assessment model measures the potential impact of a threat on assets given its occurrence probability. The estimated risk of each security alert is updated dynamically as the alert is correlated to prior ones. This enables the adaptive risk metric to evaluate the cloud's overall security state. The prediction system raises early warnings about potential attacks to the autonomic component, controller. Thus, the controller can take proactive corrective actions before the attacks pose a serious security risk to the system. According to our experiments, both risk metric and prediction model have successfully signaled early warning alerts 39.6 minutes before the launching of the LLDDoS1.0 attack. This gives the system administrator or an autonomic controller ample time to take preventive measures.","","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073270","Autonomic response;HMM;Intrusion prevention;cloud computing;early warning;intrusion prediction;online risk assessment","Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Risk management;Security;Vectors","cloud computing;hidden Markov models;probability;risk management;security of data;virtualisation","ACIDF;LLDDoS1.0 attack;adaptive risk metric;autonomic cloud intrusion detection framework;autonomic cloud intrusion prevention systems;autonomic prevention actions;cloud infrastructure;early warnings;finite state hidden Markov prediction model;occurrence probability;online risk assessment model;prediction system;preventive measures;proactive corrective actions;risk measure;security technologies;virtualization","","0","","20","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It does not require installation of any additional hardware and extra communication costs; its computational requirements are negligible. The proposed technique ma be used in both hierarchical and flat WSNs. The paper contains recommendations to the choice of threshold value for each traffic parameter.

It uses CRC- style functions to determine a unique location for a possible match and then matches the input against the pattern stored in the specified memory location. This approach achieves is a very low logic and a reasonable memory cost. In this paper we extend the HashMem architecture to allow storing of variable-length patterns in a single memory structure, reducing the number of required memory structures and comparators. In this way, we improve the density of the memories and reduce the necessary logic for CRC functions and comparators. These improvements allow V-HashMem to accommodate the newest Snort rule-set with modest memory and very low logic cost of about 0.06 logic cells per search pattern character. This logic cost is almost an order of magnitude smaller compared to other research. Variable length HashMem uses single-ported memories, thus allowing the simultaneous processing of two characters per cycle using the FPGA dual ported memories and additional logic. We also extend the V-HashMem architecture to include a header-ID field and support header matching information, a feature missing both from our own earlier work and many related systems.","","1-4244-0312-X","","10.1109/FPL.2006.311244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4101006","","Acceleration;Computer architecture;Computer science;Costs;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Scalability;Throughput","feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;memory architecture;pattern matching;security of data","CRC functions;FPGA;Snort-like intrusion detection;comparators;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;single memory structure;variable-length Hashmem architecture","","2","","16","","","28-30 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the approaches assume that there are sufficient neighbors to help monitor the transmissions and receptions of data packets by other nodes to detect abnormality. However, in a sparsely connected adhoc network, nodes usually have very small number of neighbors. In addition, new history based routing schemes e.g. Prophet have been proposed because traditional adhoc routing schemes do not work well in sparse ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a ferry-based intrusion detection and mitigation (FBIDM) scheme for sparsely connected ad hoc networks that use Prophet as their routing scheme. Via simulations, we study the effectiveness of the FBIDM scheme when malicious nodes launch selective data dropping attacks. Our results with different mobility models, ferry speed, traffic load scenarios indicate that the FBIDM scheme is promising in reducing the impact of such malicious attacks.","","978-1-4244-1024-8","978-1-4244-1025-5","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451068","DoS resilience;disruption tolerant networks;intrusion detection;prophet;routing;sparsely connected adhoc networks","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;History;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Resilience;Routing protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","data dropping attacks;ferry-based intrusion detection;history based routing schemes;mobile ad hoc networks;sparsely connected ad hoc networks","","8","","20","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes two approaches to detecting anomalies from measurements from sensor networks. The first approach is a linear programming-based hyperellipsoidal formulation, which is called a centered hyperellipsoidal support vector machine (CESVM). While this CESVM approach has advantages in terms of its flexibility in the selection of parameters and the computational complexity, it has limited scope for distributed implementation in sensor networks. In our second approach, we propose a distributed anomaly detection algorithm for sensor networks using a one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine (QSSVM). Here a hypersphere is found that captures normal data vectors in a higher dimensional space for each sensor node. Then summary information about the hyperspheres is communicated among the nodes to arrive at a global hypersphere, which is used by the sensors to identify any anomalies in their measurements. We show that the CESVM and QSSVM formulations can both achieve high detection accuracies on a variety of real and synthetic data sets. Our evaluation of the distributed algorithm using QSSVM reveals that it detects anomalies with comparable accuracy and less communication overhead than a centralized approach.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2051543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483231","Anomaly detection;distributed computing;information security;machine learning;outlier detection;security;support vector machines (SVMs);wireless sensor networks","Computer networks;Computer science;Condition monitoring;Detection algorithms;Fault diagnosis;Intrusion detection;Linear programming;Permission;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;hyperellipsoidal support vector machines;hyperspherical support vector machines;intrusion detection;linear programming;one-class quarter-sphere support vector machine;wireless sensor networks","","35","","52","","2010-06-10","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades. Moreover, the volumes of data to be analyzed are beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools. They are not only large in scale but fast in/out in terms of velocity. In big data IDS, the one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data dimensions and volumes. In this paper, we propose novel feature selection methods, namely, RF-FSR (Random Forest-Forward Selection Ranking) and RF-BER (Random Forest-Backward Elimination Ranking).

MANET nodes operate in a decentralized ""trust no peer"" mode that complicates and inhibits security services, thus creating a formidable security challenge. Here the design of MANS is presented and its performance is investigated. MANS is based on a ""neighborhood watch"" concept. This approach builds a fully decentralized scalable security policy that is law-governed globally using only local actions. MANS formally prescribes a local collaborative group function by defining neighborhoods, their states and neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions. It utilizes these concepts in developing the security recovery policy, including specification, implementation, and enforcement. MANS has been tested successfully with simulation experiments; the results presented here cover the case of an attacked but honest node as well as that of a compromised dishonest node. In both cases, it is shown that MANS identifies the attacked and/or compromised node, requiring only a modest size neighborhood to accomplish it. Then, MANS acts to isolate the node and thus avoid or minimize any adverse impact of its compromise.","1062-922X","0-7803-7952-7","","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244370","","Ad hoc networks;Collaboration;Data security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic;Voting;Watches","ad hoc networks;law;mobile radio;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET nodes;decentralized scalable security policy;law-governed policy;local collaborative group function;mobile ad-hoc network security;neighborhood watch;neighborhood-wide majority voting decisions;security recovery policy;security services;trust no peer mode","","3","","5","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a fuzzy IDS to address the uncertainty problem in distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic. The proposed fuzzy detection engine implements a taxonomy of DoS attacks in a decision-tree structure, to combine expert knowledge and machine intelligence. The introduction of fuzziness in misuse patterns makes it possible to focus on category of attacks rather than crisp attack thresholds which are easily bypassed by slight variations in attack methods. On the other hand, our approach is different from anomaly detection, since our defined categories are more detailed than just normal and abnormal. The proposed system is tested experimentally against KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. Comparing to other related works, our system exhibited a detection rate of 99.91%,while only produced around 1600 false alarms in more than 5 million test sessions, against DoS flooding attacks, where just a reduced number of features employed.","","978-1-4799-5658-6","","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030332","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030332","Classification;Denial of Service;Fuzzy Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Taxonomy","Protocols;Taxonomy","computer network security;decision trees;fuzzy set theory;telecommunication traffic","DoS flooding attacks;KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;attacks categorization;computer systems;cyber attacks;decision-tree structure;expert knowledge;fuzzy IDS;fuzzy detection engine;fuzzy intrusion detection system;machine intelligence;malicious network traffic;misuse patterns;modern DoS attacks;network environments;normal network traffic;uncertainty problem","","0","","18","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We specially analyze the harm of a type RC intrusion in RPL using ETX metric, which further validates the effectiveness of our work. Second, we design IDSs for RPL to defense intrusions. Our design discusses detection methodologies, system architectures, detection data and intrusion respose with some promotions. To satisfy the energy efficiency requirements, we propose three type Monitor Nodes (MNs) devices for different RPL applications. To explicitly show the design of IDSs, we apply our IDS to defense the type of RC intrusion in RPL using ETX metric on Contiki OS, and the results verify the effectiveness of our IDSs. Finally, we theoretically analyzed the applicability of IDSs for RPL.","","","","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247579","Contiki OS;IDSs;LLNs;RPL;Routing Choice (RC) intrusion","Delays;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Manganese;Monitoring;Routing","computer network security;energy conservation;routing protocols","Contiki OS;ETX metric;IDS;LLN;MN;RC intrusion;RPL security;energy efficiency;intrusion detection system;low power and lossy network;monitor node;routing choice intrusion;routing protocol","","","","12","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we discuss the problem of anomaly detection in MANET. The focus of our research is on techniques for automatically constructing anomaly detection models that are capable of detecting new or unseen attacks. We propose a new anomaly detection method for MANET. The proposed method performs cross-feature analysis on the basis of rough sets to capture the inter-feature correlation patterns in normal traffic. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation. The results show that proposed method effectively detects anomalies and identify attack types using the intrusion detection method.","","978-1-4244-2107-7","978-1-4244-2108-4","10.1109/WiCom.2008.1088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4678996","","Authentication;Communication system security;Cryptography;History;Information analysis;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Rough sets;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;rough set theory;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;cross-feature analysis;inter-feature correlation patterns;intrusion detection;mobile ad-hoc networking;rough sets;security mechanisms","","0","","8","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An IP flow is a unidirectional series of IP packets of a given protocol, traveling between a source and destination, within a certain period of time. Based on ""flow"" concept, we developed a flow-based aggregation technique that dramatically reduces the amount of monitoring data and handles high amounts of statistics and packet data. FSSAS sets up flow-based statistical feature vectors and reports to a neural network classifier. The neural classifier uses back-propagation networks to classify the score metric of each flow. FSAS can detect both bandwidth type DOS and protocol type DOS. Moreover, flow here could be any set of packets sharing certain common property as ""flow key"". FSAS configures flow flexibly to provide security from network level to application level (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP...), and different aggregation schemes, such as server-based, client-based flow. This novel IDS has been evaluated by using DARPA 98 data and CONEX test-bed data.

Our proposed hybrid and hierarchical NIDS both monitors the payload of network data in the network layer and also analyzes network-based attacks as anomalies in the application layer using statistical processing and classification. Both the advantages of signature-match and anomaly-analysis techniques are exploited in our system. A naive Bayes analysis algorithm is used in our prototype to implement and enhance the ability of our detection system.

Here, we apply a computational intelligent technique which incorporates the merits of two of the heterogeneous modeling approaches (linear time-invariant and neural networks), while considering both temporal and functional dependencies existing among the elements of an infrastructure. The experimental platform includes a power grid simulator of the IEEE 30 bus model and a cyber network emulator. Subsequently, we implemented a wide range of integrity attacks (replay, ramp, pulse, scaling, and random) with different intensity levels.

Then, we can determine whether we need to perform network or security operation. We apply clustering algorithm for AID and classification algorithm for MID. The nonlinear adaptive system is trained for running MID and AID in parallel. Proposed parallel system is more lightweight and simple to operate even if the number of incident patterns is increased. Experimental results in the case where false positive is frequently caused show that our method is functional with a recognition rate of attacks less than 10%, while finding the anomaly status.

In our approach we consider that a nervous system design and organization is a constructive process carried out by genetic information encoded in DNA. Our NEA evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a Lindenmayer System with memory that implements the principles of organization, modularity, repetition (multiple use of the same sub-structure), hierarchy (recursive composition of sub-structures), as a metaphor for development of neurons and its connections. In our method, this basic neural codification is integrated to a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that implements the constructive approach found in the evolutionary process, making it closest to the biological ones. Our method was initially tested on a simple, but non-trivial, XOR problem. We also submit our method to two other problems of increasing complexity: Prediction of the effect of a new drug on Breast Cancer and KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Some advantages of the proposed methodology are that it increases the level of implicit parallelism of the GA and seems to be capable of generating minimal satisfactory neural architectures, resulting in a reduction of project costs and increasing the performance of the evolved ANN, suggesting a promising potential for future applications.","","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280535","","Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;Genomics;Legged locomotion;RNA","DNA;genetic algorithms;neural net architecture;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","ANN;DNA;KDDCUP'99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset;L-system;Lindenmayer System;NEA;artificial neural networks;biologically inspired neuroevolutive algorithm;breast cancer drug;constructive process;evolutionary computation;evolutionary process;genetic algorithm;genetic information encoding;hierarchical neural structures;minimal satisfactory neural architectures;modular neural structures;nervous system design;neural codification;nontrivial XOR problem;project cost reduction;recurrent neural structures;recursive substructure composition","","","","","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of blacklists is to predict and block future attack sources. Existing blacklisting techniques have focused on the most prolific attack sources and, more recently, on collaborative blacklisting. In this paper, we formulate the problem of forecasting attack sources (also referred to as ""predictive blacklisting"") based on shared attack logs, as an implicit recommendation system. We compare the performance of existing approaches against the upper bound for prediction and we demonstrate that there is much room for improvement. Inspired by the recent NetFlix competition, we propose a multi-level collaborative filtering model that is adjusted and tuned specifically for the attack forecasting problem. Our model captures and combines various factors namely: attacker-victim history (using time-series) and attackers and/or victims interactions (using neighborhood models).
