They are becoming ubiquitous and have been widely used to transfer critical information, such as banking accounts, credit cards, e-mails, and social network credentials. The more pervasive the wireless technology is going to be, the more important its security issue will be. Whereas the current security protocols for wireless networks have addressed the privacy and confidentiality issues, there are unaddressed vulnerabilities threatening their availability and integrity (e.g., denial of service, session hijacking, and MAC address spoofing attacks). In this paper, we describe an anomaly based intrusion detection system for the IEEE 802.11 wireless networks based on behavioral analysis to detect deviations from normal behaviors that are triggered by wireless network attacks. Our anomaly behavior analysis of the 802.11 protocols is based on monitoring the n-consecutive transitions of the protocol state machine. We apply sequential machine learning techniques to model the n-transition patterns in the protocol and characterize the probabilities of these transitions being normal. We have implemented several experiments to evaluate our system performance. By cross validating the system over two different wireless channels, we have achieved a low false alarm rate (<;0.1%). We have also evaluated our approach against an attack library of known wireless attacks and has achieved more than 99% detection rate.","1556-6013","","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2433898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7109166","Anomaly detection;IEEE 802.11 security;Intrusion detection;Protocol analysis;Wireless Network security;Wireless networks;intrusion detection;protocol analysis;wireless network security;wireless networks","Communication system security;Detectors;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Wireless networks","learning (artificial intelligence);probability;security of data;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 behavior analysis;intrusion detection system;n-transition pattern;security protocol;sequential machine learning technique;transitions probability;wireless anomaly detection;wireless attack;wireless channel;wireless communication network;wireless technology","","0","","27","","2015-05-15","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, several machine learning techniques have been proposed to automate and develop intelligent network forensics systems. An intelligent network forensics system that reconstructs intrusion scenarios and makes attack attributions requires knowledge about intrusions signatures, evidences, impacts, and objectives. In addition, problem solving knowledge that describes how the system can use domain knowledge to analyze malicious activities is essential for the design of intelligent network forensics systems. In this paper we adapt recent researches in semantic-web, information architecture, and ontology engineering to design a method ontology for network forensics analysis. The proposed ontology represents both network forensics domain knowledge and problem solving knowledge. It can be used as a knowledge-base for developing sophisticated intelligent network forensics systems to support complex chain of reasoning. We use a real life network intrusion scenario to show how our ontology can be integrated and used in intelligent network forensics systems.","","978-1-4244-7551-3","978-1-4244-7549-0","10.1109/PST.2010.5593235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593235","","Cognition;Forensics;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Ontologies;Problem-solving","computer forensics;computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence)","computer networks;information architecture;intelligent network forensics analysis;machine learning techniques;ontology engineering;problem solving knowledge;semantic-web","","2","","15","","","17-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the hysteresis and incompleteness of the signature establishment as well as the inaccuracy of statistics probability model, the effectiveness of traditional signature-based and statistics-based anomaly detection methods are directly restricted. Besides, the species and complexity of anomaly behaviors are varying so fast along with the outbreak of network traffic and the influence of high-speed access. It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph (FL-LPVG), which constructs complex networks based on the network flow series. This method mines structural behavior patterns of the associated graph and detects anomaly traffic through data mining and entropy-based information theoretic techniques. Experiments on KDD Cup 99 dataset demonstrate that this method greatly simplify the process of anomaly detection, and effectively reduce dimensionality of high-dimensional data, and at the same time this method gets a good detection effect.","","","978-1-84919-729-8","10.1049/cp.2013.2470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826019","Anomaly Classification;Anomaly Detection;Limited Penetrable Visibility Graph;Machine Learning","","computer network security;data mining;entropy;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","FL-LPVG;anomaly behaviors;anomaly traffic detection;associated graph;big data processing;complex networks;data mining;entropy-based information theoretic techniques;flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph;high-dimensional data dimensionality reduction;network flow series;network traffic;network-based anomaly detection methods;signature establishment hysteresis;signature establishment incompleteness;signature-based anomaly detection methods;statistics probability model;statistics-based anomaly detection methods;structural behavior pattern mining","","0","","","","","22-24 Nov. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Therefore, centralized botnets detection helps greatly improve control of unwanted traffic. The main contribution of this study is the development of a common detection mechanism aiming at the centralized botnets. In this work we investigate the intrinsic characteristics based on the distributed yet bursting property of the centralized botnets. Our study shows that there exist great similarity and synchronization among the behaviors and the command and control (C&C) traffic of the bots, because the bots are controlled to operate according to the programmed schedule. Firstly we can determine if the groups of flows are suspectable by performing evaluation on the payload similarity and sequence correlation. Further, we will monitor and keep tracking with the collective and simultaneous behaviors of the suspicious groups of hosts. As is shown by conducting experiments, the proposed method can detect and hold back the centralized botnets effectively before they seriously influence the normal operation on the wide-scale network.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207950","Bot;Centralized Botnet;Command and Control(C&C);Similarity and Synchronization","Centralized control;Command and control systems;Communication system traffic control;Distributed processing;Internet;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Performance evaluation;Protocols;Sun","computer networks;synchronisation;telecommunication control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","HTTP;botnet controllers;centralized Botnet detection;command-and-control traffic;customized protocols;payload similarity;real-time communication platform;sequence correlation;synchronization;traffic aggregation;unwanted traffic control","","7","","23","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 34th Annual 2000 International Carnahan Conference on","20020806","2000","","","151","159","In the early 1960's the first ideas were developed by leading companies in Germany (Siemens, Wachtel, etc) to design an intrusion detection system following a capacitance measurement principle. The first detection electronics and set-ups were designed for indoor use (jewellery shops, museums, etc..) but in 1964 the first capacitive detectors for outdoor use i.e. perimeter security systems appeared on the market with very poor performance results. During the 1970's and 80's and sometimes over very long periods, several world wide electronic companies tried to create good working solutions using simple and inexpensive hardware for outdoor use. Sometimes excellent ideas were integrated in the electronic design but generally any investment in a innovative hardware design such as (Insulators, wiring, etc...) were poorly supported. In 1982 Siemens AG was the first company in this market which analysed all outdoor influences and who recognised the essential problems which cause any classic capacitive or electrostatic detector suffering from high unwanted false alarm rates. This was even if the newest sophisticated digital electronics and algorithms were used. The result was that already in 1984 a complete new peripheral hardware design, with a very high electrical and capacitive stability, was created and patented by Siemens AG which remains state of the art even now and which is making capacitive detectors work under most of all environmental conditions. Nevertheless even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects. These effects change the field, periodically generating very high false alarm rates which are extremely difficult to detect and to measure. The reason is that the false alarm rate is specific to a site and as such is difficult to identify. It is a fact that even well trained system engineers have difficulty in solving such problems. This paper describes a practical case experienced in 1999 where a coincidental combination of seaside conditions and a local desert wind strongly interfered in the physics of a capacitive i.e. electrostatic field detector and where trivial (but expensive) measures needed to be taken to finally solve the problem","","0-7803-5965-8","","10.1109/CCST.2000.891181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891181","","Capacitance measurement;Consumer electronics;Detectors;Electrostatics;Hardware;Insulation;Intrusion detection;Investments;Security;Wiring","electric fields;safety systems","electrostatic field detector;intrusion detection;local desert wind;perimeter security systems;seaside conditions","","1","","4","","","2000","23 Oct 2000-25 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6688002","","Accuracy;Correlation;Entropy;Markov processes;Monitoring;Smart grids","Markov processes;energy management systems;power engineering computing;safety systems;smart meters;smart power grids;temporal logic","AMI;IDS;advanced metering infrastructure;bidirectional communication;device malfunctioning;energy management;event log collection;fourth order Markov chain;intrusion detection systems;linear temporal logic;malicious behavior detection;probabilistic model checking;real-world dataset;smart collectors;smart grids;smart meters;stochastic model;user premises;utility provider","","0","","14","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We observe that signatures from worms and their variants are relevant and a tree structure can properly reflect their familial resemblance. Hence, in contrast to an isolated view of generated signatures in previous approaches, PolyTree organizes signatures extracted from worm samples into a tree structure, called signature tree, based on the formally defined ""more specific” relation of simplified regular expression signatures. PolyTree is composed of two components, signature tree generator and signature selector. The signature tree generator implements an incremental signature tree generation algorithm from worm sample clustering, up-to-date signature refinement to efficient tree construction. The incremental signature tree construction gives insight on how the worm variants evolve over time and allows signature refinement upon a new worm sample arrival. The signature selector chooses a set of signatures for worm detection from a benign traffic pool and the current signature tree constructed by the signature tree generator. Experiments show that PolyTree cannot only generate accurate signatures for polymorphic worms with noise, but these signatures are well organized in the signature tree to reflect the inherent relations of worms and their variants.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2010.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487493","Signature tree;polymorphic worm;sequence alignment.;signature generation","","digital signatures;invasive software;tree data structures","NSG system;PolyTree;network based signature generation;polymorphic worm;signature extraction;signature selection;signature tree generation;tree structure;up-to-date signature refinement;worm sample clustering","","7","","36","","2010-06-17","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The scheme is based on random number rate control mechanism. It utilizes delegation concept for authentication at the Access Point (AP). Under flooding DoS, AP is unable to verify large number of client authentication requests. It hence, forwards optional message containing hash to the Authentication Server (AS). AS verifies the hash and sends response back to AP, thereby detecting DoS attack. The attack impact at the AP is reduced by dropping the attack packets while selecting the legitimate one. The scheme protects AS from DoS as hash calculations for detection of DoS are done once only. Scheme also prevents against legacy authentication/association and deauthentication/disassociation flooding DoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-0127-5","","10.1109/WICT.2011.6141379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141379","802.11i;Denial of Service;WLAN Security;authentication","Authentication;Computer crime;Floods;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Microwave integrated circuits;Public key","access protocols;authorisation;client-server systems;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;message passing;wireless LAN","DoS attack detection;DoS attack reduction;WLAN;access point;authentication server;client authentication requests;deauthentication;denial of service attacks;hash calculations;legacy association;legacy authentication;message forwarding;random number rate control mechanism;wireless LAN;wireless security protocols","","0","","29","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge is to develop an approach to dynamically detect anomalies with an acceptable accuracy while the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network is minimized. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient approach for detecting anomalies in sensed data in a WSN. The anomaly detection procedure is comprised of two phases: training and detection. In the training phase, every sensor node computes a description of its local sensed data and sends it to its group head. After receiving descriptive data from member nodes, the group head applies approximate global principal component analysis (AGPCA) to establish a global normal profile and sends it to all member nodes. In the detection phase, every member node detects anomalies based on their projection distances from the global first principal component. As environmental conditions change over time, the established global normal profile is updated using weighted coefficients. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high detection rate with low false alarm rate while minimizing the energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-8183-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2010.5734031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5734031","energy-efficient anomaly detection;malfunctioning node;principal component analysis;wireless sensor network","Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;wireless sensor networks","WSN;approximate global principal component analysis;energy consumption;energy-efficient anomaly detection approach;global first principal component analysis;low false alarm rate;member node;sensor node;weighted coefficients;wireless sensor networks","","2","","14","","","4-6 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too.

This paper presents various host based anomaly detection techniques. One technique uses clustering with markov network (CMN).

During testing, each Markov network calculates the probability of each testing instance. If the probability from multiple markov networks is low, we classify the point as malicious. The paper also presents CMN with Outlying subspace (CMN-OS). In CMN-OS, a training data set that consists of benign and few malicious data is used to identify the outlying subspace which is used as a lower dimensional representation of the full dimensional space. Then, CMN uses the new subspace to represent its training and testing data sets. Finally, the paper presents Clustered Label Propagation (CLP). CLP starts by clustering benign and malicious training. It then labels each cluster based on its central-most point. During testing, these points are added to the testing data as labeled points and Label Propagation is used to label the testing data. We experimentally show that CMN approach outperforms several other approaches and performs similar to CMN-OS and we show that it is less sensitive to noise as compared to other approaches.","","978-1-4799-3143-9","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754055","Computer security;Markov random fields;host-based Anomaly Detection","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Manganese;Markov random fields;Testing;Training;Training data","Markov processes;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;probability;security of data","CLP;CMN;CMN-OS;benign training clustering;clustered label propagation;clustering-with-Markov network;computer-security;host-based anomaly detection techniques;learning techniques;malicious training clustering;outlying subspace;probability calculation","","0","","20","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents attack diagnosis (AD), a novel attack mitigation scheme that combines the concepts of Pushback and packet marking. AD's architecture is inline with the ideal DDoS attack countermeasure paradigm, in which attack detection is performed near the victim host and attack mitigation is executed close to the attack sources. AD is a reactive defense that is activated by a victim host after an attack has been detected. A victim activates AD by sending AD-related commands to its upstream routers. On receipt of such commands, the AD-enabled upstream routers deterministically mark each packet destined for the victim with the information of the input interface that processed that packet. By collecting the router interface information recorded in the packet markings, the victim can trace back the attack traffic to the attack sources. Once the traceback is complete, the victim issues messages that command AD-enabled routers to filter attack packets close to the source. The AD commands can be authenticated by the TTL field of the IP header without relying on any global key distribution infrastructure in Internet. Although AD can effectively filter traffic generated by a moderate number of attack sources, it is not effective against large-scale attacks. To address this problem, we propose an extension to AD called parallel attack diagnosis (PAD) that is capable of throttling traffic coming from a large number of attack sources simultaneously. AD and PAD are analyzed and evaluated using a realistic network topology based on the Skitter Internet map. Both schemes are shown to be robust against IP spoofing and incur low false positive ratios.","1095-2055","0-7803-9428-3","","10.1109/ICCCN.2005.1523866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1523866","","Atherosclerosis;Computer crime;IP networks;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication services","DDoS attack;IP header;Internet protocol;PAD;Skitter Internet map;TTL field;attack diagnosis;attack mitigation scheme;counter-measure paradigm;distributed denial-of-service;global key distribution infrastructure;packet marking;parallel attack diagnosis;pushback marking;realistic network topology;transistor-transistor logic","","3","","17","","","17-19 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","978-0-7695-4159-4","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","3","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ADBHC generates clusters using density-based partitioning method which has less computational cost. It uses the improved hierarchical clustering tree to implement fast scalable and adaptive anomaly detection. The improved hierarchical clustering tree supports updating profiles at any time. We extend the clustering algorithm and apply branch and bound mechanism for filtering noise. With the help of two advantages: filtering noise and updating profiles at any time, our algorithm is effective enough to meet adaptive requirements.

This paper proposes an algorithm based on Bitmap which can detect stealthy superpoints. The algorithm includes online module and offline module. The online module consists of two submodules. One uses a bloom filter to filter the duplicate packets and store the source addresses. The other uses two-dimensional bit arrays to process packets. The offline estimates the cardinality.

We collect a large set of DDoS attack traffic by implementing various DDoS attacks as well as normal data during normal usage. Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods. Only using several attributes also improves the efficiency in terms of attributes constructing, models training as well as intrusion detection.","","978-1-4244-3309-4","","10.1109/CRISIS.2008.4757464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4757464","Bayesian networks;C4.5;DDoS attack detection;Intrusion detection system;attribute selection","Bayesian methods;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","belief networks;security of data","Bayesian networks;DDoS attacks;attribute selection;;distributed denial-of-service attack;intrusion detection system","","3","","16","","","28-30 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, considerable effort has been focused on detecting and predicting the breaches in security propagated by these malicious applications. However, the enormity of the Internet poses a formidable challenge to representing and analyzing such attacks on it using scalable models. Furthermore, the unavailability of complete information on network vulnerabilities makes the task of forecasting the systems that are likely to be exploited by such applications in the future even harder. This paper presents a technique to identify attacks on large networks using a highly scalable model, while filtering for false positives and negatives.

We formulate the problem of distributed collaborative defense against coordinated attacks in MANET as a dynamic game problem. In our formulation we have on the one hand a group of attackers that observe what is going on in the network and coordinate their attack in an adaptive manner. On the other side, we have a group of defending nodes (the IDS nodes) that collaboratively observe the network and coordinate their actions against the attackers. Using extensions of the game theoretic framework of [3] we provide a mathematical framework for efficient identification of the worst attacks and damages that the attackers can achieve, as well as the best response of the defenders.

Aiming at the problems of traditional techniques, an immunity-based dynamic method for network anomaly detection, referred to as WAD, is proposed in this paper. WAD builds an appropriate profile using only a subset of normal elements and adapts the varieties of self and non-self space, which adjust adaptively the self radius, the detection radius, and numbers of detectors to amend the built profile.

One of the most frequent attacks is Denial of Service (DoS), which can easily be generated but its detection is not trivial. In this paper, a framework is proposed to detect Denial of Service attacks and other forms of intrusions, then generate responses accordingly. Our proposed detection engine combines the specification- and anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques.

This is one reason why over 40 proposals, addressing these problems, have been published. Regrettably, not many of these researchers have considered scalability, extensibility and other performance issues by testing their promising prevention techniques in a real network. We find that there are around eight practical frameworks and the aim of this paper is to revisit these countermeasures solutions.

Although sensor nodes have low computation and communication capabilities, they have specific properties such as their stable neighborhood information that allows for detection of anomalies in networking and transceiver behaviors of the neighboring nodes. We show that such characteristics can be exploited as key enablers for providing security to large scale sensor networks. In many attacks against sensor networks, the first step for an attacker is to establish itself as a legitimate node within the network. To make a sensor node capable of detecting an intruder a simple dynamic statistical model of the neighboring nodes is built in conjunction with a low-complexity detection algorithm by monitoring received packet power levels and arrival rates.","","0-7803-9181-0","","10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512911","","Communication system security;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Transceivers;Wireless sensor networks","mobile radio;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","detection based security scheme;dynamic statistical model;intrusion detection system;low-complexity detection algorithm;neighboring nodes;packet power levels;transceiver behaviors;wireless sensor networks","","36","","16","","","22-24 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These malicious attempts including hacking, botnets and works are pushing organization networks to a risky atmosphere where the intruder tries to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of resources. In order to detect these malicious activities, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been widely deployed in corporate networks. IDSs play an important role in monitoring traffic behaviors in a computer network, identifying the anomalous activity and notifying the security analyst with current network status. Unfortunately, one of the IDSs' drawbacks is they produce a large number of false positives and non-relevant positives alerts that could overwhelm the security analyst. Therefore, the process of analyzing alerts in order to provide a more synthetic and high-level view of the attempted intrusions is needed. This process is called Alert Correlation. In this paper, we present commonly used alert correlation approaches and highlight their advantages and disadvantages from various perspectives. Subsequently, we summarize some current alert correlation models with their alert correlation approach.","","","","10.1109/ACSAT.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836553","Alert Correlatios;Anomaly Detection;Intrusion Detection System;Misuse Detection","Computational modeling;Computers;Correlation;Data mining;Internet;Intrusion detection","security of data","IDS;alert correlation models;intrusion detection systems;malicious attempts;network intrusion attempts","","0","","35","","","23-24 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Diverging from the traditional rule- or statistical-based pattern matching techniques, the proposed mechanism represents security events in a graphical form of correlation networks and identifies security events through the computation of graph similarity measurements to eliminate the need for constructing user or system profiles.

Anomaly intrusion detection approaches have the advantage of detecting previously unknown or new attacks, but suffer from the possible high false alarms due to the problem of behavior drifting and the difficulty of building an adaptive model. In this paper, we propose a model based on the data mining technique - naïve Bayes classification to classify an input event (system call sequences generated from privileged processes) as “normal” or “anomalous” to detect system anomalous behavior. The independent frequency of each system call from a process collected under the normal conditions is the basis for the classifier. The ratio of the probability of a sequence from a process and the probability NOT from the process serves as the input of a fuzzy system for the classification. Experimental results in a data set consisting of both normal and intrusion traces show that the model can successfully detect most of intrusion traces with a very low false alarm rate.","","978-1-4673-1713-9","978-1-4673-1712-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377776","Anomaly Intrusion Detection;Data Mining;Fuzzy Logic;Naïve Bayes Classifiers;Privileged Processes;System Calls","Data mining;Data models;Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Training data","data mining;fuzzy logic;pattern classification;probability;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection approach;anomaly-based IDS;data mining technique;false alarm rate;fuzzy logic;input event classification;intrusion trace;misuse IDS;naive Bayes classification;probability;system call sequence","","0","","13","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complete distribution of the intrusion detection process is the salient feature of our proposition: distribution is not restricted to data collection but also applied to execution of the detection algorithm and alert correlation. Each node in the MANET runs a local IDS (LIDS) that cooperates with others LIDS. A mobile agent framework is used to preserve the autonomy of each LIDS while providing a flexible technique for exploring the natural redundancies in MANET to compensate for the dynamic state of wireless links between high mobility nodes. The proposed solution has been validated by actual implementation, which is described in the paper. Three attacks are presented as illustrative examples of the IDS mechanisms. Attack detection is formally described by specification of data collection, attack signatures associated with such data and alerts generation and correlation.

Embedded systems are, by nature, application specific and therefore frameworks for developing application-specific intrusion detection systems for distributed embedded systems must be researched, designed, and implemented. In this paper, we present a configurable middleware-based intrusion detection framework. First, we present a system model and a concrete implementation of a highly configurable intrusion detection framework that is integrated into MicroQoSCORBA, a highly configurable middleware framework developed for embedded systems. Our framework autogenerates application-specific intrusion detection systems by exploiting application-specific information accessible to the middleware framework (e.g., object interfaces and method signatures). Next, a set of configurable intrusion detection mechanisms suitable for embedded systems is presented. A performance evaluation of these mechanisms is presented at the end of the paper.","","0-7695-2328-5","","10.1109/ICDCSW.2005.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437169","","Data security;Distributed computing;Embedded system;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Microprocessors;Middleware;National security;Power system security;SCADA systems","distributed object management;embedded systems;middleware;quality of service;security of data","MicroQoSCORBA;configurable middleware-based intrusion detection framework;distributed embedded systems;embedded system security","","1","","32","","","6-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The drawback of misuse based approach is that it cannot detect new type of attacks. Hence anomaly based intrusion detection were used and it is capable of detecting unknown attacks also.

Such an intermediate host is called a stepping-stone. The intruders have developed some evasion techniques such as injecting chaff packets. A number of algorithms have been proposed to detect stepping-stones, but some of them failed to detect correctly when the network traffic is somehow corrupted or with the chaff packets. We discuss the viability of solving those issues by improving a previous methodology. The algorithm is based on finding as many matched pairs of incoming and outgoing packets on the same host as possible and then decide whether it is a stepping-stone connection by the mismatched rate. We examine a number of tradeoffs in choosing the threshold values by simulating network traffic. Our experiments report a very good performance with very low false detection rates when using carefully selected parameter values.","1521-9097","978-0-7695-3434-3","","10.1109/ICPADS.2008.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724356","Stepping-stone;chaff;connection chain;intrusion detection;network security","Computer science;Cryptography;Delay;Delta modulation;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Routing;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;USA Councils","computer networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","chaff packet;evasion technique;false detection rate;network intrusion detection system;network routing;network traffic;stepping-stone detection","","6","","13","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

What s more, we can work out FPP threshold and sample numbers. Theoretical analysis also finds that under some conditions the cost for alert checkup increases with FPP increasing. Together with them we construct FPP information network based on Bayes network to reduce checkup losses.

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.","1060-9857","978-1-4577-1349-1","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076761","card data flow;compliance;payment system;private cloud;virtual machine","Credit cards;Decision support systems;Kernel;Security;Sockets;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","PCI DSS compliance;card transaction processing;credit card data flow automated discovery;credit card process;intrusive instrumentation;middleware;payment card industry;payment infrastructure;personal financial transactions;private cloud environments;security compliance;source code application;virtual machine introspection technology;virtual machines;virtualized servers","","3","","29","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Performance evaluation is performed in terms of the detection probability, false alarm rate, detection delay and the robustness of the algorithms to different detection threshold values. The algorithms are applied locally to measurements collected from three locations of an experimental network and under two attack intensities. The results show that the cumulative sum algorithms are more robust and achieve higher performance under both attack intensities. Next, we use the Dempster-Shafer algorithm to fuse the outputs provided by the above locally executed algorithms at different nodes, thus forming a collaborative intrusion detection system. The evaluation shows that the robustness substantially increases while the performance remains high, for both types of attacks.","","978-1-905824-16-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5722371","Dempster-Shafer;collaborative intrusion detection;cumulative sum algorithms;jamming;performance evaluation;signal-to-noise ratio;simple threshold algorithms","Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Jamming;Measurement;Monitoring;Robustness;Signal to noise ratio","inference mechanisms;jamming;radio networks;security of data;statistical analysis","Dempster-Shafer algorithm;anomaly-based intrusion detection algorithms;collaborative intrusion detection system;jamming attacks;robust detection;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical characteristics;wireless networks","","1","","14","","","16-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
