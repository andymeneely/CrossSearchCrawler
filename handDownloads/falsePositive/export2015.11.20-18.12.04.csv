Seventh Annual","20090519","2009","","","378","385","Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are particularly vulnerable to attacks from malicious nodes as the reliability of all communication and data exchange on the network depends on collaboration of participating network nodes.In order to strengthen overall mobile network security and avoid attack, malicious nodes should be detected and appropriate measures taken, e.g. exclusion from network communications.In order to effectively identify malicious nodes we propose a system for Trust Evaluation and Reputation Exchange for Cooperative intrusion detection in MANETs (TEREC). Each node should monitor its directly connected neighbour nodes and resulting measurements and trust information should be gathered and exchanged cooperatively between all network nodes. These measurements when combined with information from other nodes can construct a node reputation value representing the trustworthiness of a specific network node.We propose to split reputation information into two values:trust and confidence. This allows each node to successively determine the reliability of other nodes without the need or reliance on a static, pre-established trust infrastructure (e.g.digital certificates) which requires significant overhead and can not be recovered once compromised.TEREC is evaluated via simulation and its performance measured in the presence of an increasing amount of malicious nodes. Evaluation results show that a benign majority of nodes prevail over malicious attacking nodes as they are able to accurately classify network nodes based on reputation estimations.","","978-1-4244-4155-6","978-0-7695-3649-1","10.1109/CNSR.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4939153","Computer Network Security;Cooperative Systems;Mobile Communication","Communication networks;Communication system security;Computer graphics;Cryptography;Data security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Uncertainty","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","cooperative intrusion detection;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;network nodes;network reliability;network security;reputation exchange;trust evaluation","","5","","17","","","11-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.

This paper presents a new approach to detect anomaly behaviors in encrypted accesses with SSH2 protocol to network public servers such as http servers, ftp servers and database servers. In this approach, first the system extracts information from each SSH client, which is consist of transferred data size and time interval between messages. Second, the various actions are identified based on similarity of information. Finally, attacks are detected according to intrusion signatures, generated from the frequency of accesses and specifications of TCP traffic. This system dose not decipher private information, because it detect intrusion only by use of transferred data size and time interval between messages and does not require too many calculations, which are needed in common encrypted traffic analysis methods, before start operation. We show that this system is able to detect various attacks with a high accuracy, by implementing our proposed system on the Snort intrusion detection software and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4244-1691-2","978-1-4244-1692-9","10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4580619","","Access protocols;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data security;Databases;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","cryptography;feature extraction;network servers;security of data;transport protocols","DARPA evaluation dataset;SSH protocol;Snort intrusion detection software;TCP traffic;database servers;decipher private information;encrypted accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;encryption protocols;http servers, ftp servers;intrusion signatures;network public servers","","3","","18","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose two similarity (resp., dissimilarity) measures. We show that similarity and dissimilarity can be described by one linear equation. Based on this result, we take a novel approach to address the anomalybased intrusion detection. This approach converts all the profiles composing the training database into 2-dimensional geometric points such that these points lie on the the same line y = n-x. A simple comparison operation is sufficient to decide whether an object is normal or anomalous.

Countermeasures have been developed, but still many users are infected. Detecting and preventing communication by infected users from the network side would effectively mitigate the threats of malware. For this, we need to collect information about the destinations or payloads of malware communication. Dynamic analysis is usually used to obtain this information. Since some malware requires access to the Internet, e.g., bots and downloaders, the dynamic analysis environment must connect to the Internet. Recently developed malware communicates with remote hosts by HTTP protocol for not only command-and-control (C&C) or malware downloading but also attacks. For secure dynamic analysis in an environment with Internet connectivity, it is necessary to determine if the destination is for C&C or malware downloading and to only allow connection to these servers. We propose a dynamic analysis system with Internet connection that controls HTTP communication by using a search engine. To control HTTP connections, we built a classifier using a support vector machine based on the assumption that sites for C&C or malware downloading, for example, are harder to find and have a lower backlink count than benign sites. Our classifier, which is trained on popular URLs and URLs based on malware analysis, has 99.69% cross-validation accuracy. We evaluated other known benign popular sites with our classifier, and they were all classified as benign. Our evaluation confirms that our classifier can distinguish benign sites, so the proposed dynamic analysis system is effective for safe analysis in an environment with Internet connection.","","978-1-4577-1034-6","","10.1109/CSS.2011.6058563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6058563","dynamic analysis;malware;search engine;support vector machine","Fires;Internet;Irrigation;Malware;Payloads;Protocols;Search engines","Internet;command and control systems;invasive software;search engines;support vector machines;system monitoring;transport protocols","HTTP protocol;Internet connection;URLs;command-and-control;communication prevention;infected user detection;malware HTTP communications;malware analysis;malware communication;malware downloading;search engine;secure dynamic analysis system;support vector machine","","3","","20","","","8-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Of these attacks, 183 attacks are zero-days' to the rule set and 173 attacks are theoretically known to it. The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection). The detection rate is however on overall greater for theoretically known attacks (a mean of 54% detection). The paper then investigates how the zero-days' are detected, how prone the corresponding signatures are to false alarms, and how easily they can be evaded. Analyses of these aspects suggest that a conservative estimate on zero-day detection by Snort is 8.2%.","","","","10.1109/HICSS.2014.600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6759203","Computer security;NIDS;code injection;exploits","Computer architecture;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Reliability;Servers;Software;Testing","computer network security;digital signatures","SNIDS;false alarm;signature based network intrusion detection;zero day attacks;zero day detection","","0","","21","","","6-9 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key component of the GPS is the security information management (SIM) module where data mining technology is employed to analyze the events (alerts) collected from the LPSs. Once a DDoS attack is recognized by the SIM module, the GPS informs the LPS (IDS/IPS) to adjust the thresholds immediately to block the attack from the sources.

Recently model-based qualitative evaluation has been used for the evaluation of security protocols to quantify security properties in terms of intrusion tolerance using quantitative modeling techniques. However, most of the prior work focused only on measuring security properties, largely ignoring the performance impact of the security mechanisms introduced into the system. In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between security and performance properties of an intrusion detection system (IDS) in a wireless group communicating setting. In particular, we analyze how often the IDS should perform intrusion detection to effectively trade security off for performance, or vice versa, for the system to satisfy the application security and performance requirements. Given the mean time to security failure (MTTSF) for the system to reach a failure state, and the response time per rekey operation for the wireless group communicating system as metrics, we identify the optimal intrusion detection rate under which the MTTSF metric can be best traded off for the response time metric.","","0-7803-9427-5","","10.1109/NPSEC.2005.1532047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532047","","Area measurement;Availability;Communication system security;Data security;Delay;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Performance analysis;Stochastic systems;Wireless communication","radio networks;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;model-based qualitative evaluation;security mechanisms;wireless group communicating systems;wireless networks","","1","","16","","","6 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current research shows that change detection methods can be used for a wide range of real time applications. Detecting the changes by observing data collected at different times is one of the most important applications of network security because they can provide analysis of short interval on global scale. Research in exploring change detection techniques for medium/high network data can be found for the new generation of very high resolution data. The advent of new technologies has greatly increased the ability to monitor and resolve the details of changes in order to analyze better. Analyzing large amount of data is still a new challenge. The data need to be analyzed and corrected for registration and classification errors for identifying frequently changing trend. In this research paper we have proposed a unified and novel approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which embeds a Change Detection Algorithm with Data Mining (DM) technique. IDS are considered as a system integrated with intelligent subsystems, which completes the distributed solution procedure on the basis of exchanging large data and information. The goal is to learn more effectively from the model. The knowledge developed automatically adjusts to the changes as well as threshold while minimizing the false alarm rate and timely detection. A hybrid approach for improving the performance of detection algorithm by building more intelligence to the system is proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results are properly substantiated for better effectiveness, system security and flexibility.","","978-1-4673-5832-3","","10.1109/ACSAT.2012.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516336","Anomaly Detection;Change Detection;Network Intrusion;Outlier Detection;Performance Evaluation;Threshold Algorithms","","data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","IDS;SVM;change detection algorithm;change point outlier detection method;classification error;data analysis;data collection;data exchange;data mining;distributed solution procedure;false alarm rate minimization;frequently changing trend identification;information exchange;intelligence building;intelligent subsystem;intrusion detection analysis;learning;network data;network security;real time intrusion detection system;registration error;support vector machine;system security;timely detection","","0","","18","","","26-28 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, such systems have increased their connectivity by using public networks and standard protocols (e.g. TCP/IP). However, while enhancing productivity, this will expose these systems to cyber threat. This is because many widely-used protocols in these systems such as MODBUS, DNP3 and EtherNET/IP are lacking authentication, and therefore command injection and data injection are potential threat. An unsupervised intrusion detection technique (with unlabelled data) is an appropriate method to address this issue because labelling the huge amount of data produced by such systems is a costly and time-consuming process. However, unsupervised learning algorithms suffer from low detection accuracy. This paper proposes a framework that can be used as an add-on component for any unsupervised approach to improve its performance.

Unfortunately, most approaches to correlation concentrate on just a few components of the process, providing formalisms and techniques that address only specific correlation issues. This paper presents a general correlation model that includes a comprehensive set of components and a framework based on this model. A tool using the framework has been applied to a number of well-known intrusion detection data sets to identify how each component contributes to the overall goals of correlation.

IEEE 6th International Conference on","20091117","2009","","","342","352","Ad-hoc wireless networks are being deployed in critical applications that require protection against sophisticated adversaries. However, wireless routing protocols, such as the widely-used AODV, are often designed with the assumption that nodes are benign. Cryptographic extensions such as Secure AODV (SAODV) protect against some attacks but are still vulnerable to easily-performed attacks using colluding adversaries, such as the wormhole attack. In this paper, we make two contributions to securing routing protocols. First, we present a protocol called route verification (RV) that can detect and isolate malicious nodes involved in routing-based attacks with very high likelihood. However, RV is expensive in terms of energy consumption due to its radio communications. To remedy the high energy cost of RV, we make our second contribution. We propose a multigrade monitoring (MGM) approach. The MGM approach employs a previously developed lightweight local monitoring technique to detect any necessary condition for an attack to succeed. However, local monitoring suffers from false positives due to collisions on the wireless channel. When a necessary condition is detected, the heavy-weight RV protocol is triggered. We show through simulation that MGM applied to AODV generally requires little extra energy compared to baseline AODV, under the common case where there is no attack present. It is also more resource-efficient and powerful than SAODV in detecting attacks. Our work, for the first time, lays out the framework of multigrade monitoring, which we believe fundamentally addresses the tension between security and resource consumption in ad-hoc wireless networks.","","978-1-4244-5113-5","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336981","","Communication system security;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Protection;Radio communication;Routing protocols;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","MGM approach;ad-hoc wireless networks;cryptographic extensions;energy consumption;heavy-weight RV protocol;multigrade monitoring approach;multigrade security monitoring;network security;radio communications;route verification protocols;wireless channel;wireless routing protocols","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The hindrance of such attacks is entirely dependent on their detection. The detection is a major part of any security tool such as intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), adaptive security alliance (ASA), check points and firewalls. Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account multiple layered perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing. The system uses sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms. The developed system is applied to different probing attacks. Furthermore, its performance is compared to other neural networks' approaches and the results indicate that our approach is more precise and accurate in case of false positive, false negative and detection rate.","","978-1-4244-4681-0","978-1-4244-4683-4","10.1109/ISIEA.2009.5356382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356382","Dataset;Detection Rate;False Negative;False Positive;Learning;Multiple Layered Perceptron;Neural Network;Probing attack;Remote to User;Resilient Backpropagation;User to root","Adaptive systems;Application software;Artificial neural networks;Backpropagation;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","adaptive security alliance;artificial neural network;computer network systems;cyber attack;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multiple layered perceptron;probing attacks detection;supervised neural network","","2","","27","","","4-6 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve these goals, several papers have explored the concept of mutual revocation (sometimes termed suicide) wherein the trust value of both the accuser and the accused node are temporarily set to zero without involving a quorum. In this paper we explore a partial mutual revocation approach wherein we design a class of trust update functions to temporarily punish both the accuser and accused node (without involving a quorum) - however, the trust update function does not essentially set their trust values to zero; instead it partially lowers the trust values of both the accuser and the accused. In addition, we allow a trusted authority or a quorum may (periodically) review such partial mutual revocations and update the trust values of the accuser and the accused nodes accordingly (e.g., reward the accuser and punish the accused if the accusation was deemed true). We present a detailed design of the trust update functions for partial mutual revocation. Through both analysis and simulations, we evaluate the effectiveness of partial revocation under different attack strategies and report its performance in terms of revocation immediacy, revocation accuracy and abuse resistance.","","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2013.6644971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644971","Ah Hoc Networks;Mutual Revocation;Partial Trust Revocation;Trust Management","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Conferences;Monitoring;Resistance;Routing;Sensors","ad hoc networks;computer network security;military communication;military computing;trusted computing","Zigzag;abuse resistance;accused node;accuser node;operational trust management;partial mutual revocation;revocation accuracy;revocation immediacy;tactical ad hoc networks;trust update function;trust value;trusted authority","","1","","18","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we combine control flow graphs with resource consumption information to more accurately model a program's behavior during execution. Intuitively, this technique allows access to more information within each state, providing opportunities for more accurate decisions when considering anomalous behavior. Additionally, because we do not need as many states to represent an application's execution, we can achieve lower overhead than existing CFG-based systems.

The IDSaaS can be roughly classified into two types: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. During the packet inspection, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others, even to the cloud provider, for privacy concerns. However, current solutions of IDSaaS have not much discussed this issue. In this work, focus on the signature-based IDSaaS, we begin by designing a promising privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism, the main feature of which is that the process of signature matching does not reveal any specific content of network packets by means of a fingerprint-based comparison. We further conduct a study to evaluate this mechanism under a cloud scenario and identify several open problems and issues for designing such a privacy-preserving mechanism for IDSaaS in a practical environment.","","","","10.1109/INCoS.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630405","Cloud Environment;IDSaaS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Privacy Preserving;Signature Matching","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Encryption;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Payloads","cloud computing;data privacy;digital signatures","IDS-as-a-Service;IDSaaS;anomaly-based detection;cloud computing;cloud provider;fingerprint-based comparison;packet inspection;privacy concerns;privacy-preserving intrusion detection mechanism;privacy-preserving signature;signature matching process;signature-based detection","","0","","47","","","9-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, we argue that ""SoftMan"" (SM) technology goes a long way toward realizing the ideal behavior desired in an intrusion detection system. This paper discusses various characteristics in which SoftMan could be applied to the problem of detecting and responding to intrusions. The paper looks not only at the benefits derived from intelligence, but also at those associated with Multi-SoftMan alliance in general. After exploring these benefits, a novel network security defence mechanism based on Multi-SoftMan is proposed. At the same time, the paper visualizes the architecture and system behaviors of Multi-SoftMan intrusion prevention system (MSMIPS). Relevant abstract mathematical models and detailed inferential equations are founded. The experimental results show that MSMIPS enables member sites in the same trust community or different ones to forewarn attacks cooperatively. Furthermore, SoftMan technology also provides a novel idea for improving detection efficiency to the current network intrusion detection system (N1DS).","","978-0-7695-3290-5","","10.1109/CCCM.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4609541","Agent;Computer security;Cooperation model;Intrusion detection system;Intrusion prevention system;Network security defence;SoftMan","Communication system control;Communication system security;Communications technology;Computer networks;Computer security;Control systems;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Samarium","computer networks;multi-agent systems;security of data;telecommunication security","intrusion detection system;multiSoftMan intrusion prevention system;network security defence mechanism","","3","","13","","","3-4 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14]; but the wireless network is still vulnerable to denial of service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks; we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features: monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our wireless self protection system (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.","","978-1-4244-1024-8","978-1-4244-1025-5","10.1109/MOBIQ.2007.4451054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4451054","","Communication system security;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Intrusion detection;Protection;Signal analysis;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless channels","WLAN security management;adaptive machine learning;anomaly-based behavior analysis;data mining;denial of service attack;genetic search;multichannel monitoring;network card;self-protection system;wireless intrusion detection system;wireless local area network","","4","1","24","","","6-10 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present an intrusion detection scheme using Neural Networks, Rough sets and Firefly Algorithm (FA).","","","","10.1109/ICGCE.2013.6823522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823522","firefly algorithm;intrusion detection;neural network;rough set","Algorithm design and analysis;Brightness;Intrusion detection;Neural networks;Rough sets;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;radial basis function networks;rough set theory;wireless sensor networks","FA;RBF neural network;data safety;firefly algorithm;hybrid network intrusion detection model;malicious attack;network safety;radial basis function neural network;rough set;wireless sensor networks","","0","","14","","","12-14 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these classifiers work offline, since full-flow statistics are not available until a flow is finished. Therefore, it is usually too late to take actions for online deployment. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique to make these classifiers workable online. The idea is that different applications will show distinct traffic patterns from the very beginning of the flow, and so using statistics extracted from the first few packets can distinguish applications. Preliminary result shows that our method can achieve high flow accuracy, just a bit lower than using full-flow statistics. Using fewer packets per flow is promising, since it not only enables early classification and can easily apply to most of the existing classifiers, but also saves memory and computing power.","","978-0-7695-3336-0","","10.1109/CSSE.2008.911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4722720","machine learning;traffic classification","Computer science;Data engineering;Inspection;Machine learning;Payloads;Software engineering;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Sun;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","data mining;machine learning;statistical flow;traffic classifiers online;traffic flows;traffic patterns","","2","","22","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an online data validation framework to verify home energy meters (EMs) in a secondary network with real-time measurements from feeder remote terminal units (FRTUs) in primary network. A potential cybertampering is identified based on three levels: 1) feeders; 2) subsystems; and 3) customers. This framework attempts to identify malicious consumers and their locations based on historical consumption pattern and network operating conditions in real time. The proposed framework is demonstrated to detect tampering activities using a realistic 12.47-kV distribution network.

Despite the relatively long existence and the promising nature of feature selection methods, most of them fail to account for imbalance class distributions, particularly, for intrusion data, leading to poor predictions for minority class samples. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection algorithm to enhance the accuracy of IDS of virtual server environments. Our algorithm assigns weights to subsets of features according to the maximized area under the ROC curve (AUC) margin it induces during the boosting process over the minority and the majority examples. The best subset of features is then selected by a greedy search strategy.

We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the keystroke integrity verification and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic.

Although many researches have been proposed to analyze attackers' behaviors to improve the detection rate, they still suffer in high false rate in intrusion detection. Therefore, an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) deployment requires carefully planning, preparation, prototyping, testing, and specialized training. So an integrated decision system that consists of three phases was proposed in this paper: Data Preprocessing Phase, Fusion Decision Phase and Data Callback Phase. In Data Preprocessing Phase, two data reduction strategies for IDS are performed efficiently. In Fusion Decision Phase, a dynamic decision and an ensemble technology is designed and performed. In Data Callback Phase, the testing data updated through adding the undetermined data. Our experiment demonstrates that, although the false rate of integrated decision system is not the best of the four approaches discussed, the false rate is so low, its positive rate is the best one of these four, and its training time and decision time is so short that our approach is feasible for online.","","978-0-7695-3843-3","978-1-4244-5068-8","10.1109/MINES.2009.243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371022","The proximal SVM;integrated;intrusion detection;system","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Filters;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Protection;Testing","security of data;support vector machines","data callback phase;data preprocessing phase;fusion decision phase;integrated decision system;intrusion detection","","0","","9","","","18-20 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To mitigate this issue, we have developed an intelligent false alarm filter to filter out false alarms by periodically selecting the most appropriate machine learning algorithm which conducts the best performance from an algorithm pool. To evaluate the best single-algorithm performance among several machine learning schemes, we utilized two measures (e.g., classification accuracy, precision of false alarm) to determine the best algorithm. In this paper, we mainly conduct a study of applying an ROC curve-based approach with cost analysis in our intelligent filter to further improve the decision quality.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based applications can be very effectively used in military applications for detecting the landmines that are laid down by the enemy. Accurate mine detection in such application is very important otherwise it may lead to loss of life. Prompted by this we propose an adaptive sensor placement algorithm where sensor placement is dynamically determined based on existing mine concentration in a given area thus ensuring that sensors are localized in the region of higher mine concentration. We further use clustering algorithm for data aggregation from sensor nodes reported from high mine density region; this ensures optimum utilization of sensor batteries which is one of the major determinants in sensor lifetime and hence system reliability. Simulation is done for adaptive sensor deployment and data aggregation using cluster formation in areas of varying mine concentration to check the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","","978-1-4244-8678-6","978-1-4244-8679-3","10.1109/ICECTECH.2011.5941593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941593","A-means algorithm;Wireless sensor networks;adaptive sensor placement;cluster head;minimum spanning tree","Clustering algorithms;Fuel processing industries;Landmine detection;Mobile communication;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","intelligent sensors;landmine detection;military systems;wireless sensor networks","adaptive landmine detection algorithm;data aggregation;intelligent sensor deployment;military applications;wireless sensor network","","1","","23","","","8-10 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success.

In this paper, we propose a multi-HMMapproach applied for anomaly detection in clustered system call sequences. We run our experiments using the well-known system call data set provided by the University of New Mexico (UNM).

Complex networks may incorporate several layers of such protection. However, this obfuscation also hinders legitimate cyber security functions, discovering the complete path of a suspicious traffic flow requires inspecting forwarders' logs, unraveling one layer of concealment at a time. These challenges are compounded when centralized cyber-defense teams must pursue suspicious activity across numerous regional and individual site networks. Identifying a single host at the end of a dubious transaction may require coordination among central, regional, and local administrators, as well as human review of many intermediary devices' activity logs. In this paper, we describe an approach to automate the investigation process by correlating details of alerts and forwarder records to iteratively discover the chain of forwarders implicated in a given transaction. By rapidly revealing a suspicious transaction's true endpoints, incident response times can be dramatically reduced, allowing for rapid intervention and analysis. We present our prototype tracing algorithm in pseudo-code, describe the diverse lab environment in which it was developed, and detail specific trace scenarios for both web and Domain Name Service traffic. We address unique log formats and behaviors of different forwarders and recommend practices for specific units. Finally, we discuss means to integrate investigation triggers and results into existing Security Information and Event Management deployments, empowering cyber-defense analysts without further complicating their workflows.","","","","10.1109/MILCOM.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956734","cyber-defense;cyber-security;network","Detectors;Firewalls (computing);IP networks;Internet;Ports (Computers);Servers","IP networks;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","IP transaction tracking;Internet protocol networks;SIOD;centralized cyber defense;cyber security functions;cyber-defense analysts;event management deployments;network address translation;prototype tracing algorithm;pseudo-code;security incident origin discovery;security information;traffic flow;traffic forwarding techniques","","0","","15","","","6-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new method in correlating data and events for ""network based intrusion detection systems"". When an attack occurs, the correlation of security parameters is changed. We propose to use the state of correlation between parameters to detect an attack. First we show how to select effective security parameters for our detection engine with statistical correlation methods. Then, we propose how to build correlation relation graphs (CRG) for the parameters showing higher correlation. Finally we show how the attack may be detected with comparing the CRG parameter pairs for each session with the deviation from the regression line of them.

Thus, it is important to create some type of detection and prevention of the network from being attacked. Intrusion detection systems monitor computer networks looking for evidence of malicious actions. Networks are complex systems, and a comprehensive intrusion detection solution has to be able to manage event streams with different content, speed, level of abstraction, and accessibility. The current network surveillance system like network intrusion detection system (NIDS) has many defects, such as low detection ability, lack of effective response mechanism, poor manageability, etc. Besides, other problems are; it only has a single function of detecting intrusion and supports and experts needed to configure different layout of NIDS makes the systems not flexible and also upgrade intolerant. The main goal for this project is to design an IPS (intrusion prevention system), a network surveillance, analysis, and response system for high-speed network. In addition, the system provides a networking surveillance tools featured with alert monitoring systems with fast response system. The system also has the ability of remote surveillance system that will be integrated with the web and mobile access. We have developed a prototype system and demonstrated usefulness of our approaches. In regards to speed and latency, our result analysis have shown that our anomaly and signature detection capable enough to block an attack in fast response time.","","978-1-4244-1691-2","978-1-4244-1692-9","10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4580633","","Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Content management;Data security;Delay;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Surveillance","Internet;mobile computing;security of data","alert monitoring systems;event streams;integrated Web-mobile remote surveillance system;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention system;network intrusion detection system;network surveillance system;remote surveillance system;signature detection","","0","","11","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The gait characteristic of a normal walker in the nature state is an average gait period of 1.2s, in which a step period is about 0.6s and a foot touchdown time is about 0.2s. When a person walks fast or runs, the step period is reduced to about 0.4s and the foot touchdown time still keeps about 0.2s. It is included in the vibration signal caused by a walking intruder inevitably. So the detection system output signal caused by a human intrusion is intermittent and periodical. If a sensing system output waveform has a period of 0.3–0.75s and a duration time of 0.15–0.25s, the disturbance source can be adjudged as a human intrusion, not as an animal or other random one. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results with an in-line Sagnac interferometer fiber fence system and a φ-OTDR intrusion detection system, respectively.","","978-1-55752-877-3","978-1-55752-877-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5405622","fiber fence;gait characteristic;intrusion signal recognition;step period","Animals;Character recognition;Foot;Humans;Legged locomotion;Optical fiber networks;Optical interferometry;Optical sensors;Sagnac interferometers;Signal detection","","","","0","","10","","","2-6 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, new attacks are being created everyday, which make it hard to design a system that will catch these attacks. The need is not only for preventing the attack but also for detecting such attacks if it happened. Intrusion detection systems is built to do this task and complement other security systems.

The statistical anomaly prevention system employs back-propagation neural network forecasting model, which predicts unauthorized invasions of user based on previous observations and takes further action before intrusion occurs. Our back-propagation neural network model makes periodic short-term forecasts, since long-term forecasts cannot accurately predict an intrusion. We use a multivariate time series technique to forecast the hacker's behavior effectively. Our back-propagation neural network model results have been compared with traditional statistical forecasting models, and a better prediction accuracy has been observed. In order to reduce single point of failures in centralized security system, a dynamic distributed system has been designed in which the security management task is distributed across the network using Intelligent multi-agents.","","0-7803-8243-9","","10.1109/ICISIP.2004.1287634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287634","","Data security;Database systems;Deductive databases;Distributed databases;Information security;Intelligent networks;Neural networks;Predictive models;Real time systems;Transaction databases","backpropagation;multi-agent systems;neural nets;safety systems;security of data;software agents;statistical databases","backpropagation neural network forecasting model;centralized security system;database security system;dynamic distributed system;hackers behavior forecast;intelligent multiagents;long term forecasts;multivariate time series technique;periodic short term forecasts;real time monitoring approach;security management task;software agents;statistical anomaly prevention system;statistical database;statistical forecasting models;unauthorized invasion prediction","","1","1","8","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the use of trace abstraction techniques for reducing the execution time of anomaly detectors while keeping the same accuracy. The key idea is to represent system call traces as traces of kernel module interactions and use the resulting abstract traces as input to known anomaly detection techniques, such as STIDE (the Sequence Time-Delay Embedding) and HMM (Hidden Markov Models). We performed experiments on three datasets, namely, the traditional UNM dataset as well as two modern datasets, Firefox and ADFA-LD. The results show that kernel module traces can lead to similar or fewer false alarms and considerably smaller execution times compared to raw system call traces for host-based anomaly detection systems.","","978-1-4673-7556-6","","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208644","Host-based Anomaly Detection System;Software Dependability;Software Security;System Call Traces;Trace Analysis and Abstraction","Accuracy;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Testing;Training","embedded systems;hidden Markov models;safety-critical software","ADFA-LD;Firefox;HMM;STIDE;UNM dataset;execution time;hidden Markov model;high false alarm rate;host-based anomaly detection;sequence time-delay embedding;trace abstraction approach","","0","","38","","","26-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rule learning, neural networks, statistics, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are some of the kinds of representative methods for intrusion detection. Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously. Experimental results with the 1999 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Intrusion Detection Evaluation (IDEVAL) data confirm that ENNs are promising tools for intrusion detection.","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.860136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634649","Anomaly detection;computer security;evolutionary algorithms;intrusion detection system (IDS);neural networks","Computer security;Data security;Evolutionary computation;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Neural networks;Pattern matching;Statistics","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;anomaly detection;evolutionary neural network;intrusion detection;machine learning techniques;program behavior;system-call audit data;system-call sequences","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Security;Evolution;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Validation","16","","25","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two feature selection algorithms were involved to generate two feature sets. These two features sets were then utilized to produce a combined and a shared feature set, respectively. The shared feature set consisted of features agreed by the two feature selection algorithms and therefore considered important features for identifying intrusions. Human intervention was then conducted to find an optimal number of features in between the combined (maximum) and shared feature sets (minimum). Empirical results showed that the proposed feature set gave equivalent results compared to the feature sets generated by the selected feature selection methods, and combined feature sets.","","978-0-7695-3595-1","","10.1109/ICIME.2009.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5077013","Bayesian Networks;Feature Selection;Network Intrusion Detection","Computational efficiency;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Data security;Face detection;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection","Internet;belief networks;security of data","feature selection approach;human intervention;intrusion detection system;network intrusion detection","","4","","19","","","3-5 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to realize secure IoT network, the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root collects information such as neighbor and parent ranks in each node and then observes network consistency by comparing a rank that a node sends to DODAG root with the rank that the same node sends to its neighbor nodes. However, the scheme has a problem that false detection rate is high since the DODAG root might compare a certain node's rank after update with its rank that its node sends to its neighbor nodes before update due to timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In this paper, we propose a low false alarm rate RPL network monitoring system by considering timing inconstancy between rank measurements. In the proposed scheme, each node sends ranks at the time when each node broadcasts the latest rank to the DODAG root so as to avoid inherent timing inconstancy, and each node attaches a timestamp at the time when each node sends and receives ranks and then sends the timestamp to the DODAG root in order to take timing inconstancy into consideration. We evaluate the false detection rates by computer simulation and we show that the proposed scheme reduces the false detection rate in comparison with the conventional scheme.","","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2014.6933391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933391","","Loss measurement;Monitoring;RNA;Routing protocols;Timing;Topology","IP networks;Internet of Things;directed graphs;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;timing","DODAG;IPv6 routing protocol;Internet of Things;RPL network monitoring system;destination oriented directed acyclic graph;lossy network;low false alarm rate network monitoring system;low power network;rank measurement;timestamp attachement;timing inconstancy","","0","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since there are too many events to track, such datasets are typically very large. This is particularly so in a WLAN where number of non-wired devices communicating with the WLAN can be too many and adhoc. This creates a problem for the domain expert in labeling all records in the training dataset which is used to train a machine learner. We present a simple approach by which the number of network records the expert has to examine is a relatively small proportion of the given training dataset. A clustering algorithm is used to form relatively coherent groups which the expert examines as a whole to label records as one of four classes: red (definite intrusion), yellow (possibly intrusion), blue (probably normal), and green (definite normal). An ensemble classifier-based data cleansing approach is then used to detect records that were likely mislabeled by the expert. The proposed approach is investigated with a case study of a real-world WLAN. An ensemble classifier-based intrusion detection model built using the labeled training dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeling approach and the good generalization accuracy","","0-7803-9788-6","","10.1109/IRI.2006.252413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018490","","Computer networks;Data mining;Data security;Information security;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Local area networks;Machine learning;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;wireless LAN","clustering algorithm;data cleansing;data mining;dataset training;ensemble classification;machine learning;network event record labeling;network intrusion detection;wireless LAN","","1","","15","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
