These targeted attacks use special-crafted malware and infrequent activity to avoid detection, so that hackers can retain control over target systems unnoticed for long periods of time. In order to detect these stealthy activities, a large-volume of traffic data generated in a period of time has to be analyzed. We proposed a scalable solution, Ctracer to detect stealthy command and control channel in a large-volume of traffic data. APT uses multiple command and control (C&C) channel and change them frequently to avoid detection, but there are common signatures in those C&C sessions. By identifying common network signature, Ctracer is able to group the C&C sessions. Therefore, we can detect an APT and all the C&C session used in an APT attack. The Ctracer is evaluated in a large enterprise for four months, twenty C&C servers, three APT attacks are reported. After investigated by the enterprise's Security Operations Center (SOC), the forensic report shows that there is specific enterprise targeted APT cases and not ever discovered for over 120 days.","","978-1-4673-7277-0","","10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207270","Advanced Persistent Threat (APT);Command and Control (C&amp;C);mapreduce;networking logs","Command and control systems;Computers;Electronic mail;Internet;Itemsets;Malware;Servers","business data processing;computer crime;digital forensics;digital signatures;invasive software","APT attack;C&C channel;C&C sessions;Ctracer;SOC;Security Operations Center;advanced persistent threat;enterprise log data;forensic report;hackers;malware;network signature;scalable framework;stealthy activities detection;stealthy command and control channel detection;targeted attacks;traffic data","","0","","25","","","June 27 2015-July 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to allow for automated reasoning on the information resources available for the fusion process, we design a set of comprehensive and extensible ontologies, and implemented fusion and detection algorithms as simple rules in Ontologic Web Language Description Logic (OWL-DL), using the Semantic Query-Enhance Web Rule Language (SQWRL).

The First International Conference on","20060508","2006","","","8 pp.","","Most current anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDSs) detect computer network behavior as normal or abnormal but cannot identify the type of attacks. Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","6","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to the author's knowledge, very few dynamic prioritisation metrics exist. In this paper, a new prioritisation metric - OutMet, which is based on measuring the degree to which an alert belongs to anomalous behaviour is proposed. OutMet combines alert correlation and prioritisation analysis. We illustrate the effectiveness of OutMet by testing its ability to prioritise alerts generated from a 2012 red-team cyber-range experiment that was carried out as part of the BT Saturn programme.

Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities. Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors.

These features influence both the performance of the system and the types of attacks that NIDS detects. At the same time, they cause slow training and testing process, system resource consumption expensive as well as low true detection rate. Therefore, feature selection is an important issue in NIDS.

In this paper, we proposed a new hybrid feature selection algorithm based on Chi-Square and enhanced C4.5 algorithm to build lightweight network intrusion detection system.

A malicious node can inundate the network by conducting frequent route discovery which severely reduces the network throughput. In this paper, we investigate the detection of route floods by incorporating a machine learning technique. We use a perceptron training model as a tool for intrusion detection. We train the perceptron model by feeding various network statistics and then use it as a classifier.

For researchers to address these shortcomings, they need methods for evaluating HICHPs. This paper (1) presents an evaluation method called the true positive cost curve (TPCC), which makes it possible to evaluate and compare HICHPs in an operating environment, but also allows an operator to tune HICHPs within a specific operating environment; (2) presents improvements on the way HICHPs visit Web pages and evaluates them with the TPCC method; and (3) discusses the impact of time bombs on the performance of HICHPs in an operating environment and the ability to tune an HICHP for optimal performance with the help of the TPCC.","","978-0-7695-3668-2","","10.1109/SECURWARE.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211044","client honeypot;evaluation;intrusion detection;security","Computer science;Computer security;Cost function;Design engineering;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;Weapons;Web pages;Web server","Internet;Web sites;client-server systems;online front-ends;security of data","HICHP;Internet;classification;cost-based evaluation method;dedicated vulnerable Web browser;high-interaction client honeypot;potentially malicious Web page;security device;time bomb;true positive cost curve","","4","","28","","","18-23 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most anomaly based NIDSs employ supervised algorithms, whose performances highly depend on attack-free training data. However, this kind of training data is difficult to obtain in real world network environment. Moreover, with changing network environment or services, patterns of normal traffic will be changed. This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset. The results show that the proposed approach is comparable to previously reported unsupervised anomaly detection approaches evaluated over the KDD' 99 dataset.","8164-9547","1-4244-0355-3","1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024522","","Access control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data mining;Data security;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Training data","","","","12","","25","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model generated by this GA was based on a new method of data analysis for the intrusion detection problem. Each node in the model's decision tree was designed to hold a randomized coefficient for the data, so that this coefficient multiplied by the data would yield a weight for the certainty of whether a certain record was an attack or not.

However, user credentials can be stolen and an attacker (using a stolen credential) can masquerade as the legitimate user and penetrate the system as an insider. This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen. The technique is validated with the real incident data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in detecting compromised users, while allows eliminating around 80% of false positives (i.e., not compromised user being declared compromised).","1060-9857","978-1-4577-1349-1","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076770","Bayesian network;correlation;credential stealing;intrusion detection;security","Authentication;Bayesian methods;IP networks;Monitoring;Protocols;Vectors","belief networks;security of data","NCSA;authentication protocols;data driven Bayesian network approach;national center for supercomputing applications;security incidents;shared computing infrastructures;stolen credentials;storage capabilities","","6","","25","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we report the results of a comparative study of three different methods for on-line classification of program traces based detection of anomalies in sequences of system calls by neural networks.

Honeypot is one of effective mechanism to detect and analyze intruders activities. Since packets sent to honeypots are almost always malicious, thus false alerts, that is serious problems in the normal intrusion detection system, are minimized. However, there are two important disadvantages in honeypot. First, the scope of a honeypot is limited to the address it attached. Second, there are potential risk that honeypot is compromised by a smart intruder. In this paper, we propose a centralized surveillance of unused address space. The whole unused addresses in the organization are virtually watched by a small number of the honeypots installed in a special network under the control. By the aggregation of honeypots, honeypots may be supervised well, and the risk of compromise may be reduced. The surveillance system can be established without making alternation in existing network equipments. It selects the address under surveillance autonomously. It is able to adapt to addition and deletion of networks and hosts without any administration.","","0-7695-2492-3","","10.1109/PRDC.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607533","","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Electronic mail;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Surveillance;Switches","Internet;surveillance;telecommunication security","Internet security;centralized surveillance;honeypot;unused address space surveillance;virtual networks","","0","1","10","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some stages of the attack may appear innocent if checked separately. Furthermore, the intervals between these separate attack stages can be on the order of hours, days, or even months. These characteristics of multi-stage attacks make the detection task challenging for most existing IDSs that are stateless in that they perform intrusion detection by independently checking individual packets, connections or sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, active event correlation (AEC), which collects and correlates suspicious network events inside a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). AEC infers the possibility of attacks in the context of security policies and blocks attacks before they are completed. We have implemented AEC on top of the Bro NIDS (Paxson, 1999). Experiments indicate that AEC can effectively recognize and correlate individual stages of multi-stage attacks, stop incomplete attack stages, and give network administrators meaningful and concise alerts","","0-7695-2564-4","","10.1109/IWIA.2006.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609998","","Aggregates;Bridges;Computer crime;Computer science;Conferences;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security","Bro NIDS;active event correlation;computer attacks;multistage attack detection;network intrusion detection system;security policies","","2","","20","","","13-14 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to achieve the classification, Intrusion detection systems use software computing techniques including neural networks and neuro fuzzy networks to categorize network activities and specify what category of attack is being generated. Neuro-Fuzzy classifiers are used for the initial classification of the initial network traffic. An inference system, Fuzzy inference systems is further used to determine whether the activity is normal or malicious. Efficient IDS systems are those capable of reducing false positives and generate high rate attack detection. However, fuzzy inference systems use human knowledge to create their fuzzy rule. In order to introduce a more accurate way of classifying network traffic, we introduce the use of Genetic Algorithms in conjunction with ANFIS so as to optimize data classification and obtain the best results. Genetic algorithms use a set of genetic operators such as mutation, crossover and selection on current population to reproduce similar patterns that will be used repeatedly until a particular criterion is met.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888688","ANFIS;Genetic Algorithms;Intrusion detection;Neuro-Fuzy","Biological cells;Filtering;Fuzzy logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Sociology;Training","fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;genetic algorithms;security of data","ANFIS;IDS systems;data classification;fuzzy inference systems;genetic algorithms;intelligent intrusion detection system;neural networks;neuro-fuzzy classifiers;software computing techniques","","0","","20","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, the power system operators are heavily relied on to make decisions regarding the causes of experienced disturbances and the appropriate course of action as a response. In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event.

The fusion optimization strategy is provided to guarantee that the fusion scheme can make a more accuracy decision for the suspicious behaviors with more information gathered from different levels of the system.

Hence, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are used to timely detect intrusions and defend against attack attempts. However, the current IDS technology generates a huge volume of alert events due to false alarm alerts, and requires costly alert manual reviewing due to the lack of intelligence in IDS. As a solution, security information management (SIM) is a growing area of interest in network security. In this paper, we propose FAR-FAR (frame-based attack representation and first-order logic automatic reasoning) system in SIM to relieve the administrator from the time-consuming and costly alert manual reviewing. With the backward-chaining, FAR-FAR can make real-time reasoning for network attack scenarios. In FAR-FAR, the aggregated alerts from different IDS agents are converted into uniform frame-structured streams by case grammar. Afterwards, first-order logic production rules are used to extract the hidden attack scenarios. Our simulation results show that FAR-FAR's attack scenario reasoning rate for the incoming alerts are generally far less than the incoming alerts' inter-arrival time. This guarantees FAR-FAR to automatically reason the attack plans in real time and predict possible attack attempts at an early stage.","","0-7803-8932-8","","10.1109/ITRE.2005.1503109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1503109","","Acoustic sensors;Artificial intelligence;Automatic logic units;Data security;Data visualization;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Production","Internet;backward chaining;frame based representation;frame relay;telecommunication security","Internet;frame-based attack representation;intrusion detection system;network security;real-time first order logic automatic reasoning;security information management;uniform frame-structured stream","","0","","11","","","27-30 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test. Through trace-driven experiments, we demonstrate that our defense mechanism can throttle this DoS attack within a short defense time window while generating few false alarms.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062173","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer science;Information analysis;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Resonance light scattering;Signal generators;Subscriptions;Telecommunication traffic","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;security of data","3G networks;IMS networks;IP multimedia subsystem;chain reaction DoS attack;chained automatic reaction;change-point detection;defense time window;malicious attack;malicious clients;multimedia services;non-parametric GRSh test;online early defense mechanism","","7","","30","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here all the resources are at one place in data centers. Cloud uses public and private APIs (Application Programming Interface) to provide services to its consumers in multitenant environment. In this environment Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS), especially HTTP, XML or REST based DDoS attacks may be very dangerous and may provide very harmful effects for availability of services and all consumers will get affected at the same time. One other reason is that because the cloud computing users make their request in XML then send this request using HTTP protocol and build their system interface with REST protocol such as Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure. So the threaten coming from distributed REST attacks are more and easy to implement by the attacker, but to security expert very difficult to resolve. So to resolve these attacks this paper introduces a comber approach for security services called filtering tree.

One particular type of attack that has recently become prominent is the SQL injection attack. SQL injection attacks can potentially result in unauthorized access to confidential information stored in a backend database. In this paper we describe an anomaly based approach which utilizes the character distribution of certain sections of HTTP requests to detect previously unseen SQL injection attacks.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively. The algorithm is independent of specific applications so that many ideas and solutions can be transferred to other classifier paradigms.","","978-1-4244-4786-2","978-1-4244-4787-9","10.1109/ICADVC.2009.5377998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377998","","Application software;Control systems;Energy consumption;Humanoid robots;Hydraulic actuators;Induction motors;Intrusion detection;Legged locomotion;Robot control;Testing","computer network security;data mining;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","computer networks;data mining;databases process;feature selection;information extraction;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor classifier;knowledge discovery;map data classification;supervised learning","","0","","27","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security is a fundamental issue for these service networks due to the relevant business information handled in these networks. In this paper, we design and implement an efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism, called efficient and light-weight intrusion detection mechanism for vehicular network (ELIDV) that aims to protect the network against three kinds of attacks: denial of service (DoS), integrity target, and false alert's generation. ELIDV is based on a set of rules that detects malicious vehicles promptly and with high accuracy. We present the performance analysis of our detection mechanism using NS-3 simulator.

We argue that such receptors incorporated as part of an anomaly detector enhance the detector's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous behaviour. In addition we propose that Toll-Like Receptors enable the classification of detected anomalies based on the types of attacks that perpetrate the anomalous behaviour. Classification of such type is either missing in existing literature or is not fit for the purpose of reducing the burden of an administrator of an intrusion detection system.

In most cases they are not identified in requirements and are not continuously monitored during software evolution. Therefore, the inability of a system to conform to regulations or its endangerment by new vulnerabilities is not recognized. In consequence, decisions related to security might not be taken at all or become obsolete quickly. But to evaluate efficiently whether an issue is already addressed appropriately, software engineers need explicit decision documentation. Often, such documentation is not performed due to high overhead. To cope with this problem, we propose to document decisions made to address security requirements. To lower the manual effort, information from heuristic analysis and end user monitoring is incorporated. The heuristic assessment method is used to identify security issues in given requirements automatically. This helps to uncover security decisions needed to mitigate those issues. We describe how the corresponding security knowledge for each issue can be incorporated into the decision documentation semiautomatically. In addition, violations of security requirements at runtime are monitored. We show how decisions related to those security requirements can be identified through the documentation and updated manually. Overall, our approach improves the quality and completeness of security decision documentation to support the engineering and evolution of security requirements.","","","","10.1109/ESPRE.2014.6890520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890520","Security requirements engineering;decision documentation;decision knowledge;heuristic analysis;knowledge carrying software;software evolution;user mon-itoring","Context;Documentation;IEEE Potentials;Knowledge engineering;Monitoring;Security;Software","formal specification;security of data;system documentation","end user monitoring;heuristic analysis;heuristic assessment method;organization;security decision documentation;security decisions;security issues;security knowledge;semiautomatic security requirements engineering;software engineers;software evolution;vulnerability","","0","","18","","","25-25 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these questions, we propose a simple analytical model for the window-expiration rules of popular IDS tools (i.e., Snort and Bro) and utilize a variation of the Chen-Stein theorem to derive the probability that they detect some of the commonly used scan permutations.

This is due to the ability of active worms to propagate in an automated fashion as they continuously compromise computers on the Internet. Active worms evolve during their propagation, and thus, pose great challenges to defend against them. In this paper, we investigate a new class of active worms, referred to as Camouflaging Worm (C-Worm in short). The C-Worm is different from traditional worms because of its ability to intelligently manipulate its scan traffic volume over time. Thereby, the C-Worm camouflages its propagation from existing worm detection systems based on analyzing the propagation traffic generated by worms. We analyze characteristics of the C-Worm and conduct a comprehensive comparison between its traffic and nonworm traffic (background traffic). We observe that these two types of traffic are barely distinguishable in the time domain. However, their distinction is clear in the frequency domain, due to the recurring manipulative nature of the C-Worm. Motivated by our observations, we design a novel spectrum-based scheme to detect the C-Worm. Our scheme uses the Power Spectral Density (PSD) distribution of the scan traffic volume and its corresponding Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM) to distinguish the C-Worm traffic from background traffic. Using a comprehensive set of detection metrics and real-world traces as background traffic, we conduct extensive performance evaluations on our proposed spectrum-based detection scheme. The performance data clearly demonstrates that our scheme can effectively detect the C-Worm propagation. Furthermore, we show the generality of our spectrum-based scheme in effectively detecting not only the C-Worm, but traditional worms as well.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444887","Worm;anomaly detection.;camouflage","Computer networks;Computer worms;Density measurement;Frequency domain analysis;Internet;Large-scale systems;Power measurement;Recruitment;Telecommunication traffic;Volume measurement","Internet;invasive software","C-Worm propagation detection;Internet;active worms;background traffic;camouflaging worm detection;camouflaging worm modeling;nonworm traffic;power spectral density distribution;propagation traffic;security threats;spectral flatness measure;spectrum-based scheme","","7","","65","","2010-04-08","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In response to this threat, there is a growing demand for effective techniques to detect the presence of worms and to reduce the worms' spread. Furthermore, existing approaches for anomaly detection of new worms suffer from scalability problems. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting worms based on similar patterns of connection activity. We then investigate how to improve the computational efficiency of worm detection by presenting a greedy algorithm, which minimizes the amount of traffic processing needed to detect worms, thus increasing the scalability of the system. Our evaluation shows that the greedy algorithm not only achieved high detection accuracy and reduced the amount of processing time to detect worms, but also achieved reasonable worm traffic detection in the early stages of an outbreak.","","0-7803-9087-3","","10.1109/INM.2005.1440779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440779","","Computational efficiency;Computer networks;Computer viruses;Computer worms;Greedy algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;greedy algorithms;invasive software;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet worm;anomaly detection;greedy algorithm;network intrusion detection;network security;worm traffic detection","","3","","18","","","15-19 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the DOS attack evolves the cross-correlations rise thus revealing the attack. CIDS relies on changes in correlation magnitude upon shifting from normal to attack conditions, thus it is an anomaly type intrusion detection system (IDS). However it is characterized by several advantages over anomaly IDS, primarily due to the fact that it greatly reduces and/or eliminates the need to maintain normal reference profiles. Thus CIDS (1) is algorithmically simple; (2) consumes less computational and storage resources; (3) is faster in execution; (4) promises to be more robust; and, (5) is conceptually simple, thus promises to be easier to maintain. By detecting abnormal conditions, CIDS also promises to detect novel as well as known attacks, an important advantage over signature based systems. Moreover, it achieves satisfactory misclassification rates, as demonstrated by the application of the scheme to the DARPA'98 corpus of intrusion attacks, namely false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates of 0 and 0.0605, respectively, and overall missclassification rate of 0.0011.","","0-7803-8219-6","","10.1109/SARNOF.2004.1302842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302842","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Condition monitoring;Equations;Gaussian distribution;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","authorisation;computer network management;correlation methods","CIDS;Correlation Intrusion Detection System;DARPA'98 corpus;DoS attacks;anomaly type IDS;computer network;denial-of-service attacks;false negative rates;false positive rates;feature cross-correlation;intrusion detection system;misclassification rates;novel attacks","","2","","3","","","26-27 Apr 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since biometric approaches can provide many advantages over the traditional authentication methods, they have become a significant topic for both academia and industry. The major goal of biometric user authentication is to authenticate legitimate users and identify impostors based on physiological and behavioral characteristics. In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","0","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, with the significant development of network technologies, the current IDS architecture does not support high-speed communications. Therefore, improving the performance of IDS is a major concern for researchers. In this paper, we present a model of intrusion detection based on the classification of network connections. Our approach is based on the principle of an intelligent loss. We propose a classification model based on the principle that a connection is either malicious or not. In the first case, the connection must be handled by the IDS; otherwise we can ignore it. This method reduces significantly the network flow sent to the IDS with a tolerance of an error threshold. This threshold can be adjusted by the updating process of the classification model.","","978-1-4244-6726-6","","10.1109/ICIMP.2010.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476902","classification;filtering;high-speed intrusion detection;learning","Degradation;Delay;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","pattern classification;security of data","IDS architecture;error threshold tolerance;high-speed networks;intelligent loss principle;intrusion detection systems;network connection classification","","1","","18","","","9-15 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are used for the detection of intrusive and malicious traffic in computer networks. Signature based IDS have been the most accurate among the available NIDS. But this accuracy is achieved at a cost of intensive computational power and inability to detect exploits whose signatures do not exist in the database. Statistical based IDS present a way to overcome these drawbacks with a compromise over accuracy. The key to the accuracy of the Statistical IDS lies in the classification algorithm adopted and the training data set used. This work presents a comparison of different classifier adopted for Statistical IDS.

Due to the harshness, anomaly events such as adversarial intrusions may result in harmful and disastrous situations for industrial applications but it is difficult to detect them over wireless medium. Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing. Throughout the experiments on the proposed framework, we stress the significance of one-hop clustering, which was neglected in the previous studies. Finally, we construct required logical protocols in the hierarchical framework; hierarchical intrusion detection and prevention protocols.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2010.2051556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560697","Clustering;industrial applications;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;wireless industrial sensor network","Communication system security;Industry applications;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","hierarchical intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;wireless industrial sensor network","","27","","45","","2010-09-02","Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
