The system works by using system calls made by privileged UNIX processes and trains the neural network on its basis. An algorithm is proposed that prioritize the speed and efficiency of the training phase and also limits the false alarm rate. In the detection phase the algorithm provides implementation of window size to detect intrusions that are temporally located. Also a threshold is implemented that is altered on basis of the process behavior. The system is tested with attacks that target different intrusion scenarios. The result shows that the radial Basis Functions Neural Networks provide better detection rate and very low training time as compared to other soft computing methods.

This paper mainly focuses on reducing the problem of false alarm rate, using semantic based system call patterns. Here, we make use of the semantic approach to apply on the underlying kernel level system calls which can help understand the anomaly behavior. The semantic tool used is the data dictionary. The data dictionary containing every possible combinations of sequence of system call names of particular phrase length was constructed. The features satisfying the semantic hypothesis are extracted and then normalized. The normalized values are then given as input to the decision engine.

Antigens are profiles of system calls while corresponding behaviors are regarded as signals. This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are ""embedded"" to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses.

Anomaly-based approaches have the advantage of being able to detect previously unknown attacks, but they suffer from the difficulty of building robust models of acceptable behaviour which may result in a large number of false alarms. Two reasons for the large number of false alarms, caused by incorrect classification of events in current systems, one is the simplistic aggregation of model outputs inthe decision phase. The other reason is the lack of integration of additional information into the decision process. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a two stratum Bayesian networks based anomaly detection and decision model for intrusion detection system. Bayesian networks improve the aggregation of outputs, such as empirical data and allow one to seamlessly incorporate additional information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to improve the accuracy of the intrusion detection and decision process in an anomaly based IDS.","","978-0-7695-3258-5","","10.1109/ISECS.2008.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4606112","Anomaly detection;Bayesian networks;Intrusion detection","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Computer security;Data security;Electronic commerce;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic","Bayes methods;security of data","anomaly detection model;decision process;false alarms;incorrect event classification;intrusion detection system;two stratum Bayesian network","","1","","22","","","3-5 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though in most cases these techniques are effective enough, this paper describes how instead they can be detected using properly configured IDSs. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach named polymorphic blending exfiltration that serves to avoid detection from signature-based as well as anomaly-based IDSs. This technique permits to blend the exfiltrated data in the normal and legitimate traffic. We show how IDSs can be easily improved in order to be able to detect such exfiltration.

Signatures are constructed for each class from syntactical commonalities and go beyond a single, contiguous substring. Each part of a signature is combined with positional information, which drastically improves signature accuracy and matching performance. We argue that a general description of zero-day attacks is immanently restricted to syntactical features and outline how valid signatures for novel real-world attacks were successfully generated.","","978-1-4244-5786-1","","10.1109/MALWARE.2009.5403022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5403022","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Guidelines;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Production;Protection;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security","Nebula;automatic signature generation;autonomous attack classification;malicious activity identification;positional information;signature accuracy;signature matching;signature-based intrusion detection;syntactical network intrusion signatures","","3","","16","","","13-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this field, how to improve detection rate is one of key issues. In this paper, the importance of event sequence in time is presented. Then, we discuss three factors, i.e. timestamp precision, time synchronization and network delay, which effect detection rate on the view of event sequence in time. On the three aspects, timestamp precision is the key to keep internal event sequence, time synchronization is the base of correcting event sequence among computers, and that network delay makes time-series analysis not true. Accordingly, we address some methods, i.e. raising timestamp precision, active self- adapting time synchronization algorithm and state turnabout mechanism. Experiments indicate that anyone of three measures can elevate detection performance to a certain extent.

The exception to this is a Honeypot, which analyses interactions between a third party and itself, while occupying a piece of unused information space. As honeypots are not located on productive information resources, any interaction with it can be assumed to be non-productive. This allows the honeypot to make decisions based simply on the presence of data, rather than on the behaviour of the data. But due to limited resources in human capital, honeypots' uptake in the South African market has been underwhelming. Amber attempts to change this by offering a zero-interaction security system, which will use the honeypot approach of Decision through Presence (DtP) to generate a blacklist of third parties, which can be passed on to a network enforcer. Empirical testing has been done proving the usefulness of this alternative and low cost approach in defending networks. The functionality of the system was also extended by installing nodes in different geographical locations, and streaming their detections into the central Amber hive.","","","","10.1109/ISSA.2013.6641053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641053","Honeypot;Security Models","Context;IP networks;Information security;Internet;Mathematical model;Ports (Computers)","computer network security;decision making","DtD;DtP;South African market;central Amber hive;decision making;decision through detection;decision through presence;geographical locations;human capital;modular intelligence;network enforcer;security control;zero-interaction honeypot;zero-interaction security system","","0","","22","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These IDSes can be largely classified as signature-based or anomaly-based ones depending on what type of knowledge the system knows. Signature-based IDSes are unable to detect the outbreak of new and unidentified worms when the worms' characteristic patterns are unknown. In addition, new worms are often sufficiently intelligent to hide their activities and evade anomaly detection. Moreover, modern worms tend to spread more quickly, and the outbreak period lasts in the order of hours or even minutes. Such characteristics render existing detection mechanisms less effective.In this work, we consider the drawbacks of current detection approaches and propose PAIDS, a proximity-assisted IDS approach for identifying the outbreak of unknown worms. PAIDS does not rely on signatures.Instead, it takes advantage of the proximity information of compromised hosts. PAIDS operates on an orthogonal dimension with existing IDS approaches and can thus work collaboratively with existing IDSes to achieve better performance. We test the effectiveness of PAIDS with trace-driven simulations and show that PAIDS has a high detection rate and a low false positive rate.","0730-3157","978-0-7695-3726-9","","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254234","Intrusion Detection System;Proximity;Worm","Application software;Collaborative work;Computer applications;Computer worms;Educational institutions;Failure analysis;Impedance;Internet;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis","Internet;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;PAIDS;anomaly detection;proximity-assisted intrusion detection system;signature-based scheme;unidentified worm","","0","","35","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, anomaly-based ID systems identify normal traffic within a network and report abnormal behavior. We report the findings of our research in the area of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems using data-mining techniques to create a decision tree model of our network using the 1999 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data set.

The vulnerability of internet, the distribute nature of cloud computing, various security issues related to cloud computing service models, and cloud's main attributes contribute to its susceptibility of security threats associated with cloud service availability. One of the major sophisticated threats that happen to be very difficult and challenging to counter due to its distributed nature and resulted in cloud service disruption is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Even though there are number of intrusion detection solutions proposed by different research groups, and cloud service providers (CSP) are currently using different detection solutions by promising that their product is well secured, there is no such a perfect solution that prevents the DDoS attack. The characteristics of DDoS attack, i.e., Having different appearance with different scenarios, make it difficult to detect. This paper will review and analyze different existing DDoS detecting techniques against different parameters, discusses their advantage and disadvantages, and propose a hybrid statistical model that could significantly mitigate these attacks and be a better alternative solution for current detection problems.","","978-1-4799-8827-3","","10.1109/ITNG.2015.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7113475","Cloud Security;Cloud Service Availability;Co-Variance Matrix;DDoS attacks;Entropy","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Covariance matrices;Entropy;Hidden Markov models;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;statistical analysis","CSP;DDoS attack analysis;DDoS attack detection;Internet;cloud based information technology services;cloud computing environment;cloud computing service model;cloud main attributes;cloud service availability;cloud service disruption;cloud service providers;hybrid statistical model;intrusion detection solutions;security issues","","0","","35","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of these kinds of attacks is to completely engage available resources so that legitimate users are not able to access a service. Some traceback approach has been proposed to traceback source of attack. One of these methods is Intention-driven iTrace which is the working base of the ICMP traceback. By this method, it will be possible to increase effective ICMP traceback messages which can provide useful information to the victim in tracing source of attack. Reconstructed path to the source of attack by the victim can be done accurately when more effective ICMP traceback messages are generated in critical routers.

Various wireless applications are made up of mobility and scalability based nodes. Among all the wireless networks Mobile Ad-Hoc network is one of the most significant and distinctive applications today. All the nodes are self employed, not fixed on a fixed network infrastructure, and it can act as sender as well as receiver, and directly communicate to the other nodes in the network within the communication range of the network. Also the nodes in the Wireless network can act as relay nodes to their neighbors to relay messages. Since the nodes in the Wireless Network having the ability to self-configuring by them, they are deployed in critical mission based applications like military usage or any kind of emergency recovery. Since the open medium and wide distribution of nodes make the network vulnerable to malicious attackers. In such situations, it is necessary to deploy an effective IDS mechanism to prevent or protect the Network from attacks. In the existing system EAACK - [Enhanced Adaptive Acknowledgement] is proposed as an IDS and it especially designed for MANET. In this paper a combined IP-trace back with E2AACK - [End-to-End Adaptive Acknowledgment] mechanism is proposed to detect and prevent the malicious nodes in the network. The malicious node activity can be detected by IP-trace back and prevented by getting acknowledgement from both end nodes. The simulation result shows that the E2AACK approach provides higher detection rate and prevention which greatly affect the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950038","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950038","ADHOC Networks;Delay;E2AACK;Intrusion Detection System;Malicious Nodes;Throughput","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Mobile computing;Receivers;Relays;Wireless networks","message authentication;mobile ad hoc networks;pattern clustering;telecommunication security","E2AACK mechanism;EAACK;IDS mechanism;IP-trace back;critical mission based application;end-to-end adaptive acknowledgment mechanism;enhanced adaptive acknowledgement;intrusion detection system;malicious attack prevention;malicious nodes detection;mobile ad hoc network protection;mobility based node;node authentication clustering based security;relay message;relay node;scalability based node;self-configuration ability;wired network;wireless network delay;wireless network throughput","","0","","15","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The function of the former is to reconstruct the attack paths using the information from the marked packets while the function of the later is to filter the attacking packets according to the information obtained from the former. The model has a higher efficiency in reconstructing attack path by using a novel authenticated packet marking scheme for IP trace-back. So, it can correspond to the attack flow in a short time.

After gaining network data package and pattern matching according to the protocol analysis result of primary data, the attack behavior is detected, and the signature database is unceasingly updated by new attack behavior signature. The SSL encryption authentication is used in data package transmission, which can prevent the information leakage and falsifying, and the data remain original. The serious attack behaviors are detected and saved in the evidence database, which can be used as primitive evidence for computer forensics. Simulation results show that the algorithm of association rules mining improves the efficiency of network attack behavior recognition.

If sanitization artifacts change the results of insider-threat experiments, then those results could lead to conclusions which are not true in the real world. The goal of this work is to investigate the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat detection experiments. We assemble a suite of tools and present a methodology for collecting and sanitizing data. We use these tools and methods in an experimental evaluation of an insider-threat detection system. We compare the results of the evaluation using raw data to the results using each of three types of sanitized data, and we measure the effect of each sanitization strategy. We establish that two of the three sanitization strategies actually alter the results of the experiment. Since these two sanitization strategies are commonly used in practice, we must be concerned about the consequences of sanitization artifacts on insider-threat research.

However, they do not work efficiently on unknown-attacks such as zero-day attacks and targeted attacks. This means, we should assume that our machines can be corrupted anytime. Therefore, we should consider what we can do under this assumption for a next generation security framework. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection methodology using the support of other machines. In our proposal, when an attacker tries to attack other machines from a corrupted machine that the attacker has already intruded, other machines notify it to the administrator of the corrupted machine. Then, the attacker may lose the corrupted machine. Therefore, the attacker restrains itself from imprudently attacking other machines.

A lot of approaches, especially machine learning based schemes, have been proposed to mitigate this issue by filtering out these false alarms. But a fundamental problem is how to objectively evaluate an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly identify false alarms and true alarms. To improve the utilization of various machine learning algorithms, intelligent false alarm reduction has been proposed that aims to select and apply an appropriate algorithm in an adaptive way. Traditional metrics (e.g., true positive rate, false positive rate) are mainly used in the algorithm selection and evaluation, however, no single metric seems sufficient and objective enough to measure the capability of an algorithm in reducing false alarms. The lack of an objective and single metric makes it difficult to further fine-tune and evaluate the performance of algorithms in reducing IDS false alarms. In this paper, we begin by describing the relationship between the process of intrusion detection and the process of false alarm detection (reduction). Then we provide an information-theoretic analysis of intelligent false alarm reduction and propose an objective and single metric to evaluate different algorithms in identifying IDS false alarms. We further evaluate our metric under three scenarios by comparing it with several existing metrics.","","","","10.1109/TrustCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680847","Algorithm Measurement;False Alarm Reduction;Information-Theoretic Metric;Intrusion Detection","Abstracts;Equations;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematical model;Measurement","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","IDS false alarm reduction;IDSs;false alarm detection;false alarm filtering;information-theoretic approach;intelligent false alarm reduction measurement;intrusion detection systems;machine learning based schemes;performance evaluation","","1","","24","","","16-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fast monitoring and early warning systems are very essential to prevent rapid malcodes spreading. The difficulty in detecting malcodes is that they evolve over time. Although signature-based tools such as network intrusion detection systems are widely used to protect critical systems, traditional signature-based malcode detectors fail to detect obfuscated and previously unseen malcode executables. Automatic signature generation techniques are needed to augment these tools due to the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. In particular, we need automated techniques which generate signatures without mistakenly block legitimate traffic or increase false alarms. This work investigates a technique for automatically generating sound vulnerability signatures of novel rapid malcodes. In this paper, rapid malcode signatures are automatically generated based on their spreading behavior, specially aimed at automatically extracting and deploying signatures on the packet level, without the need for reassembly that could be used by signature-based firewalls network intrusion detection system. Evaluation on Universiti Teknologi Malaysia network corpus shows higher detection accuracy at 87% compare to 56% for Snort signatures. Moreover, false negative reduces to 14% compared to 78% for Snort signatures.","","978-1-4244-8647-2","","10.1109/SCORED.2010.5703974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5703974","Signatures generation;behavioural approach;intrusion detection system;rapid malcode","","Internet;alarm systems;behavioural sciences;digital signatures;invasive software","Internet;Snort signature;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia network;automated malcode signatures generation;automatic signature generation technique;legitimate traffic block;malicious code;selfreplicating malicious program;signature based firewalls network intrusion detection system;signature based malcode detector;signature based tool;sound vulnerability signature;warning system","","0","","24","","","13-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the commonly used kernel functions of SVM such as RBF kernel and Gauss kernel are non-orthogonal, whose detection capacity and speed are unsatisfactory for complex non-linear system in IDS. LS-SVM is an evolution of classical SVM. It looks for the solution by solving linear equations instead of a convex quadratic programming in classical SVM. Wavelet kernel function has the capability of approximately orthogonal and multi-scale analysis, and has better classification and generalizing ability.

Selecting an effective and appropriate IDS system should take its functionality and performance evaluation into account.

Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex).","","978-1-4799-0194-4","","10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705192","AdjointVM;cloud computing;intrusion detection;security;trusted computing;virtual machine","Cloud computing;Hardware;Kernel;Monitoring;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;data privacy;security of data;trusted computing","AdjointVM approach;capex;capital expenditure;circular chain intrusion detection;cloud computing;confidentiality;data centers;information security;protection architecture defenselessness;untrusted cloud providers;untrusted employees","","1","","17","","","19-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban scenarios, like smart cities. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system, called INTI (Intrusion detection of SiNkhole attacks on 6LoWPAN for InterneT of ThIngs), to identify sinkhole attacks on the routing services in IoT. Moreover, INTI aims to mitigate adverse effects found in IDS that disturb its performance, like false positive and negative, as well as the high resource cost. The system combines watchdog, reputation and trust strategies for detection of attackers by analyzing the behavior of devices.

ARES '10 International Conference on","20100325","2010","","","104","111","Survivability modeling and evaluation have gained increasing importance. Most existing models assume that the distributions for transitions between states are exponential. However, this assumption does not hold in many real cases. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-Markov survivability evaluation model, which allows the transitions between states to follow nonexponential distributions. Novel quantitative measures are also proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient system in surviving intrusions. Model validation, which is possibly the most important step in the life cycle of model development, is largely overlooked in previous research.

Security requirements in MANET have to be much efficient due to specific characteristics of ad hoc network. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an integral part of any mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). It is very important for IDS to function properly for the efficient functioning of a MANET. In this paper, we try to build an IDS based on a co-operative scheme to detect intrusions in a mobile ad hoc network using basic game theory concepts. To identify the intrusion we deal with two layers - the application layer with underlying grid architecture and the network layer. We simulate a couple of intrusions in each of the two layers and look to resolve them using the coalition formation of the mobile nodes. These nodes obey the shapely value phenomena of the game theory concept and form coalitions to report intrusions in the network.","","978-1-4244-2962-2","978-1-4244-2963-9","10.1109/ADCOM.2008.4760460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760460","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;game theory;mobile communication;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET;cluster based cooperative game theory;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;mobile ad-hoc grid","","0","","7","","","14-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed algorithm, the mobility pattern of a specific node is characterized by a multi-leaf tree structure, second-level nodes stands for the possible starting points and leaf nodes stand for the destination node of each possible path. Since our algorithm is using statistical method, a normal profile for each node is generated through extensive experiments, where the specific tree generated may have several starting points and ending with several destination points. For each path between any two nodes (parent and children), we can get the distribution of every different mobility pattern. By comparing the mobility patterns with the training data, we can distinguish abnormal nodes from normal behavior nodes in mobile Ad Hoc networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed detection algorithm can achieve good performance in terms of false alarm rate and detection rate for nodes with regular mobility patterns.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","1-4244-0357-X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150901","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Detection algorithms;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Protection;Scalability;Security;Statistical analysis","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;pattern recognition;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics)","MANET;anomaly detection;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;mobility patterns;mobility profile;multi-leaf tree structure;pattern recognition","","2","","13","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As electronic commerce becomes increasingly pervasive, the subject can only become more critical. One of the more interesting techniques for enhancing information system security is detecting that an intrusion has taken place. Although intrusion-detection systems have been a part of the information security landscape for over 25 years, their proper role in the overall security picture is often misunderstood. They are not preventative security measures. Most often, they are used as active security mechanisms in conjunction with other (passive) information assurance processes like firewalls, smart cards, and virtual private networks. In practice, an intrusion-detection system (IDS) attempts to detect attacks or attack preparations by monitoring either the traffic on a computer network or the application or operating system activities within a computer. Once such behavior is detected, the IDS may alert a security administrator or it may invoke an automated response (such as closing down external communication paths or initiating a mechanism to trace the source of an attack). If an IDS detects attack behavior soon enough, it might be able to invoke a response to thwart the attack.","0018-9235","","","10.1109/6.887597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=887597","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Electronic commerce;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Intrusion detection;Smart cards;Virtual private networks","information systems;security of data","active security mechanisms;computer network traffic monitoring;denial-of-service attack;electronic commerce;information systems security;intrusion-detection systems;localized single crime;security breach","","12","4","","","","Dec 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Virtualized environments provide isolation, which gives way to better security. This paper presents an extension, WinWizard, of LibVMI that creates a VMI-based intrusion detection system (IDS) with emphasis on memory introspection. WinWizard is able to detect rootkits that attempts to hide processes from the administrator. Rootkits are able to subvert traditional virus scanning services because they are able to run at the kernel level. Rootkit detection becomes difficult because if the operating system has been subverted, especially at the kernel level, then it is difficult to find unauthorized changes to itself or its components. Most anti-viruses and other rootkit detectors that work on infected systems are usually only effective against rookits that have a defect in their hiding techniques. Rootkit detection through VMI is one way to effectively detect rookits. VMI detection tools will also be useful in industry. Industry is beginning to advance in its usage of cloud based workspaces. Examples of companies include Amazons Workspaces and Citrix XenDesktop. They offer remote desktops for small and medium sized businesses. These workspaces offer a fully managed cloud-based desktop experience where users can access their work resources from a variety of devices. Many universities and small businesses use services like these to reduce the number of IT staff and ease administration of a large number of desktops. As this field becomes more accessible, rootkits are going to drastically affect the performance and security of not only one users desktop, but on entire cloud infrastructures. The main way to detect a rootkit inside of these workspaces would be through virtual machine introspection. WinWinzard has demonstrated to be successful in detecting these types of rootkits, while causing little additional overhead to other virtual machines being hosted on the same hy- ervisor.","","978-1-4799-5062-1","","10.1109/CLOUD.2014.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973823","Intrusion Detection Systems;Virtualized-based security;Xen","Instruction sets;Kernel;Security;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS;LibVMI intrusion detection tool;WinWizard;Xen;cloud infrastructures;intrusion detection system;memory introspection;virtual machine introspection","","0","","26","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry, UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal-processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is ""near continuous wave (CW)"" performance in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The response from two parallel receive cables is fed to a full synchronous detection receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second.","","0-7803-8506-3","","10.1109/CCST.2004.1405387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1405387","","Coaxial cables;Communication industry;Correlators;Field programmable gate arrays;Monitoring;Radar signal processing;Sampling methods;Spread spectrum radar;Target tracking;Ultra wideband radar","alarm systems;coaxial cables;radar signal processing;safety systems;spread spectrum radar;target tracking;ultra wideband radar","100 to 200 m;11.6 m;CCTV assessment;CW leaky cable sensors;FPGA;GUIDAR technology;Golay codes;Homeland Security;amplitude response;burial depth;cable length;cable spacing;calibrated threshold;chip rate;commercial requirements;communications industry;complementary orthogonal codes;composite coded pulse response;field programmable gate array;governmental requirements;guided radar;in-phase response;industrial requirements;leaky coaxial cable technology;leaky coaxial cables;medium homogeneity;military operations;multiple range bin accumulators;multiple range bins;multiple simultaneous targets;near continuous wave;nuisance alarms;orthogonal complementary codes;parallel receive cables;pinpoint location;prisons;quadrature-phase response;radar signal processing;residential requirements;sensor sensitivity;signal-processing techniques;spread spectrum technology;synchronous detection receiver;synchronous sampling;target capture;thumbtack correlation functions;ultra high-speed digital correlator;ultra wide band radar;ultra-high speed correlation;video motion sensors","","2","","6","","","11-14 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes.

However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.","","","","10.1109/ICCAC.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312172","Anomaly detection;DNS;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Machine learning;Supervised training","Cloud computing","","","","","","","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The implemented system is referred to by WINIDC (Wireless Sensors and Neural Networks for Intruders Detection and Classification). WINIDC has been designed to detect intruders of many sizes and types. It can be considered as a smart and economical solution for the addressed surveillance problem. It is smart as it utilizes artificial neural networks to classify the different types of intruders. It is economical as it utilizes small, cheap wireless sensor nodes that are self-powered and self-configuring. Traditional solutions to such surveillance problem are expensive, complex and hard to maintain. The results show that integrating ANNs along with WSNs allow for real-time and accurate detection and classification of intruders.

Magnitude and complexity of attacks is continuously growing with every minute development in World Wide Web. There are plenty of web attack detection techniques but they cannot fully comprehend the required degree of security for complex web applications. The reasons include static nature of attack detection mechanism, lack of expressiveness in attack detection rules, and absence of reasoning capability to detect unanticipated ways an attack can be launched. To cater these issues, a formal approach is required that has more expressiveness and equipped with reasoning. These traits are fully adhered to by the Semantic techniques. This paper introduces an approach for utilizing Semantic techniques in web application security. This has never been introduced previously to the best of our knowledge. Here the HTTP Protocol ontology is presented to mitigate the communication protocol attacks. In this paper we are focusing on communication protocol attacks including abnormal HTTP messages, HTTP request smuggling and HTTP response splitting.

Coarse-grained (aggregated traffic) time series analysis using parametric approach, primarily carried out at the backbone network over a long time period (of the order of days to months), show strong deterministic cyclic trends, while the fine-grained (at the packet or flow level) counterpart, done mostly at edge network over small time period (of the order of few minutes), exhibit self-similar behaviour. This paper is an attempt to study the fine-grained time series characteristics of network traffic at an edge network, observed over a long period (of the order of days and weeks), using parametric approach. The analysis is carried out in the context of anomaly detection. Most of the earlier attempts in this direction followed a non-parametric approach, by either using adaptive or non-adaptive (i.e assuming stationarity) mechanisms, whose performance is found to be extremely sensitive towards empirically determined parameters of the model and hence difficult to determine. Also, the model parameters need to be recomputed at regular intervals of time (of the order of few seconds to minutes). To some extent, this make such algorithms less attractive in terms of generality and practical implementation. The first part of the paper discusses the statistical characteristics of such long range network time series. These are found to exhibit structural breaks apart from transient shocks and can be approximated by a stationary AR model, after an absolute first difference transformation (i.e decoupling stationary component from the non-stationary one). In the later part of the paper, the efficacy of the model proposed is evaluated, by conducting extensive trace driven simulations for the detection of low intensity TCP SYN flood Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Performance is measured in terms of false positives, false alarm time, detection rate and- detection delay. Experiments are performed on actual traffic traces collected from one of the edge networks over a period of three months and for various sampling intervals (10s, 60s, 120s). Comparative studies with adaptive and non-adaptive methods are carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model. It is observed that the proposed method gives better performance with 100% detection accuracy for false positive as low as 0.9%.","0742-1303","978-1-4673-1565-4","","10.1109/LCN.2012.6423689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423689","Anomaly detection;Monitoring and forecasting;Network traffic characterisation;Stochastic modeling;Time series models","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Market research;Mathematical model;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;computer network security;telecommunication traffic;time series;transport protocols","DoS attacks;adaptive mechanisms;aggregated traffic time series;anomaly detection;backbone network;coarse-grained time series analysis;decoupling nonstationary component;detection delay;detection rate;edge network;false alarm time;false positives;long range network time series modelling;low intensity TCP SYN flood denial of service attacks;network traffic characterisation;nonadaptive mechanisms;parametric approach;stationary AR model;stationary components;statistical characteristics;time 10 s;time 120 s;time 60 s;traffic traces;transient shocks","","0","","47","","","22-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Early yet accurate warning of these attacks is critical for both operators and end users. However, neither speed nor accuracy is easy to achieve because both require effective extraction and interpretation of anomalous patterns from overwhelmingly massive, noisy network traffic. The intrusion detection system presented here is designed to assist in diagnosing and identifying network attacks. This IDS is based on the notion of packet dynamics, rather than packet content, as a way to cope with the increasing complexity of attacks. We employ a concept of entropy to measure time-variant packet dynamics and, further, to extrapolate this entropy to detect network attacks. The entropy of network traffic should vary abruptly once the distinct patterns of packet dynamics embedded in attacks appear. The proposed classifier is evaluated by comparing independent statistics derived from five well-known attacks. Our classifier detects those five attacks with high accuracy and does so in a timely manner.","0890-8044","","","10.1109/MNET.2009.5274916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5274916","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Pattern analysis;Protection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","entropy;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","discovery of attacks;intrusion detection system;network security;network-based attacks;packet dynamics","","1","","20","","","September 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, it is still major challenge to reduce memory space and enhance traceback accuracy in today's high speed networks. In this paper, we propose an attack flow traceback scheme which is based on flow digests and network layer data. Digesting flow instead of individual packet would save memory and be more scalable.

The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of TCAM lookups per payload by m times with the marginally enlarged TCAM size which can be implemented by cascading multiple TCAMs. Due to the reduced number of TCAM lookups, we can easily achieve a multi-gigabit rate for scanning the packet payload.
