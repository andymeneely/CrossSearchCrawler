Ordinary intrusion detection systems usually deal with network or OS attacks and could not detect database specific attacks. Therefore, the existence of Intrusion Detection Systems in the database is a necessity. In this paper, we propose a type of intrusion detection system for detecting attacks in both database transaction level and inter-transaction level (user task level). For this purpose, we propose a detection method at transaction level, which is based on describing the expected transactions within the database applications. Then at inter-transaction level, we propose a detection method that is based on anomaly detection and uses data mining to find temporal patterns and rules. The advantage of this system compared to the previous database intrusion detection systems is that it can detect malicious behaviors in both transaction and inter-transaction levels using a hybrid approach, including specification-based detection and anomaly detection. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system, some experiments have been done. The experimental evaluation results show high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system.","","978-1-4799-5358-5","","10.1109/ISTEL.2014.7000815","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000815","data mining;database security;inter-transaction rules;intrusion detection;specification;state machine","Data mining;Database systems;Intrusion detection;Organizations;Training","","","","0","","12","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ideally, protection of the program from illegal usage would be considered at each stage of this program's life cycle. The proposition put forward here is to augment intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and employ them as a tool to support secure software development. Many state-based intrusion detection methods share structural and behavioural similarities with the set of processes known as discrete-event systems (DESs). A common structure for modelling DESs is the deterministic finite-state automaton. There exist several compatible anomaly detection techniques which construct finite- state machine models of normal behaviour through the decomposition of associated data (e.g., system calls, HTTP requests) into sequences of events. This paper proposes the application of decentralized DES theory to formally analyze and enhance these approaches to anomaly detection with misuse prevention. Models of misuse attacks are generated in the same manner as the legal usage representation, then augmented and integrated into the program model to prevent the execution of malicious sequences. The technique described herein simultaneously uses anomaly and misuse approaches to prevent and disable attacks before their completion.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529478","Software security;anomaly detection;discrete-event systems;finite-state automata","Automata;Discrete event systems;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Programming;Security;Software maintenance;Software testing","discrete event systems;finite state machines;security of data;software engineering","discrete-event systems;intrusion detection systems;legal usage representation;secure software development;software deterministic finite-state automaton","","0","","17","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the worst case, simultaneous intrusions into multiple substations can lead to severe cascading events, causing catastrophic power outages. In this paper, an integrated Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed which contains host- and network-based anomaly detection systems for the substations, and simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple substations. Potential scenarios of simultaneous intrusions into the substations have been simulated using a substation automation testbed. The host-based anomaly detection considers temporal anomalies in the substation facilities, e.g., user-interfaces, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) and circuit breakers. The malicious behaviors of substation automation based on multicast messages, e.g., Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) and Sampled Measured Value (SMV), are incorporated in the proposed network-based anomaly detection. The proposed simultaneous intrusion detection method is able to identify the same type of attacks at multiple substations and their locations. The result is a new integrated tool for detection and mitigation of cyber intrusions at a single substation or multiple substations of a power grid.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2294473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786500","Anomaly detection;GOOSE anomaly detection;SMV anomaly detection and intrusion detection;cyber security of substations","Circuit breakers;Computer security;Intrusion detection;Power grids;Substation automation","computer network security;power engineering computing;power grids;power system reliability;substation automation","ADS;GOOSE;IED;SMV;catastrophic power outages;circuit breakers;cyber intrusions;generic object oriented substation event;host-based anomaly detection systems;integrated anomaly detection system;intelligent electronic devices;malicious behaviors;multicast messages;network-based anomaly detection systems;physical security;power grid;sampled measured value;severe cascading events;simultaneous anomaly detection;simultaneous intrusion detection method;substation automation testbed;substation facilities;substations;temporal anomalies;user-interfaces","","1","","37","","2014-04-10","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Network noise is one of the most challenging issues for efficient threat detection and classification. In this study, normal and noisy datasets for network IDS domain are used and various classification algorithms are evaluated. The results show that an evaluation of algorithms without noise is misleading for IDSs since algorithms that perform best without noise do not necessarily achieve the same in a realistic noisy environment.

Most works focus on profile/model definition while critical issues related to anomaly measuring, aggregating and thresholding have not received similar attention. In this paper, we in particular address the issue of anomaly scoring and aggregating which is a recurring problem in multi-model anomaly-based approaches. We propose a two stage aggregation/thresholding scheme particularly suitable for multi-model anomaly-based approaches. The basic idea of our scheme is the fact that anomalous behaviors induce either intramodel anomalies or inter-model ones. Our scheme is designed for real-time detection of both intra-model and inter-model anomalies. More precisely, we propose local thresholding in order to detect intra-model anomalies and use a Bayesian network in order to, on one hand, extract inter-model regularities and serve, on the other hand, as an aggregating function for computing the overall anomaly score associated with each analyzed audit event. Our experimental studies, carried out on recent and real <i>http</i> traffic, show for instance that most Web-based attacks induce only intra-model anomalies and can be effectively detected in real-time. Moreover, this scheme significantly improves the detection rate of Web-based attacks involving inter-model anomalies.","","978-1-4244-2412-2","978-1-4244-2413-9","10.1109/LCN.2008.4664304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664304","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Computer science;Event detection;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Telecommunication traffic","Web sites;security of data","aggregating function;anomaly score aggregation;multi-model anomaly-based approaches;two-stage aggregation/thresholding scheme","","0","","23","","","14-17 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes a lightweight method to identify DoS attacks by analyzing host behaviors. Our method is based on the concept of BLINd Classification or BLINC: no access to packet payload, no knowledge of port numbers, and no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. Rather than using pre-defined signatures or rules as in typical Intrusion Detection Systems, BLINC maps flows into graphlets of each attack pattern.

Unlike many existing solutions, TUF does not focus on a particular type of attack, but instead takes an approach that is fundamentally more general. TUF is a cross-layer technique that detects attacks at the transport layer but responds to attacks at the network layer. Because most routing disruption attacks cause a significant drop in end-to-end goodput, monitoring the goodput of a route at the transport layer can detect abnormalities in the network (e.g., node or link failures, DoS attacks, etc.). Once an abnormal event is detected, a route rebuilding process is initiated at the network layer to find a new route. Using analysis and simulation results, we show that the TUF architecture is effective in thwarting a wide range of attacks, including protocol-compliant (also known as ""JellyFish"") attacks.","1930-529X","1-4244-0356-1","1-4244-0357-X","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150899","","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer security;Cryptography;Information security;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing protocols;Snow;Throughput","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","MANET;TUF architecture;cross-layer technique;goodput monitoring;mobile ad hoc networks;network layer;protocol-compliant attacks;route rebuilding process;routing disruption denial-of-service attacks;secure routing architecture;throughput-feedback routing;transport layer","","2","","20","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the combination rule is used to combine the data collected by two sensors. The curves of belief mass function varied with time are also shown in the paper.

Thus, to improve the current mitigation solution, this study intents to proposethe Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with the mitigation rules approach to mitigate the ICMP attack. The mitigation rules are developed specifically to mitigate the ICMP attack and to suppress the number of false alarms.

According to the different network conditions of clusters, this scheme also can dynamically set different detection parameters for different clusters to achieve a more appropriate detection algorithm.

Using the honeypot scheme, this system is able to avoid many wrong decisions made by IDS. In this system alarming adversaries, initially detected by the IDS, will be rerouted to a honeypot network for a more close investigation. If as a result of this investigation, it is found that the alarm decision made by the IDS of the agent is wrong, the connection will be guided to the original destination in order to continue the previous interaction. This action is hidden to the user. Such a scheme significantly decreases the alarm rate and provides a higher performance of IDS.

These strategies are used as a defensive mechanism to defend against malicious attacks and also the nodes monitor their neighbours continuously and stores the information about the packets sent and received based on which the subsequent stages of the game are carried forward.","","978-1-4673-5843-9","","10.1109/ICPRIME.2013.6496490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496490","Bayesian Game;Game Theory;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Adhoc Networks;Network Security","Bayes methods;Game theory;Games;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Receivers","Bayes methods;game theory;mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","Bayesian game concept;defensive mechanism;frontline security;game theoretic model;intrusion detection modelling;malicious attacks;malicious nodes;mobile ad hoc networks;non cooperative game;security threats","","1","","15","","","21-22 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we design a spectrum scanning protocol that incorporates knowledge about the scanning effectiveness across different bands, which can increase scanning efficiency. The adversary, however, can also exploit such knowledge to its advantage. To understand the interplay underlying this problem, we formulate a Bayesian model, where the IDS faces a scanning allocation dilemma: if the intruder has no knowledge, then all the bands are under equal threat, while if the intruder has complete knowledge, then less-protected bands are more likely to be threatened. We solve this dilemma and show the optimal IDS strategy switches between the optimal response to these threats. Finally, we show that the strategy might be sensitive to prior knowledge, which can be corrected by adapted learning.","","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178269","Bayesian game;Spectrum scanning;intrusion detection system","Bandwidth;Bayes methods;Games;Interference;Intrusion detection;Signal to noise ratio;Switches","Bayes methods;access protocols;radio spectrum management;security of data","Bayesian model;dynamic spectrum access scenarios;equal threat;intrusion detection system;less-protected bands;malicious activity spectrum;malicious user detection;scanner capability;scanning allocation dilemma;scanning effectiveness;spectrum scanning protocol","","0","","20","","","19-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classification boundary is constrained by a threshold matrix, where each element evaluates the degree to which an observed covariance matrix is different from the norm profile in terms of the changes of correlation between the monitored network features represented by this element. Based on Chebyshev inequality theory, we give a practical (heuristic) approach to determining the threshold matrix. Furthermore, the result matrix obtained in the detection serves as the second-order features to characterize the detected flooding attack. The performance of the approach is examined by detecting Neptune and Smurf attacks-two common distributed Denial-of-Service flooding attacks.

Intrusion detection can successfully prevent many attempts to crash network and hamper web services by intruders and hackers. The classification data mining approaches are proposed and used effectively for intrusion detection. However, presences of ambiguous data packets which exhibit traits of two or more classes reduce the overall accuracy of classification. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of supervised partition membership preprocessing method to identify ambiguous packets. We propose an integrated model that results in improved classification accuracy by explicitly clustering ambiguous packets to overcome its misclassification. The novelty of our approach lies in use of non-crisp clustering techniques like fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough k-means (RKM) that can model ambiguity. Further, we also examined whether FCM clustering and RKM clustering can help to determine class of ambiguous packets exactly or approximately.

In this paper, two soft computing techniques, fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence, are used to solve these problems. We proposed SFK-means approach which inherits the advantages of K-means, Fuzzy K-means and Swarm K- means, simultaneously we improve the deficiencies.

A common approach is to screen content in storage and transmission for exposed sensitive information. Such an approach usually requires the detection operation to be conducted in secrecy. However, this secrecy requirement is challenging to satisfy in practice, as detection servers may be compromised or outsourced. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving data-leak detection (DLD) solution to solve the issue where a special set of sensitive data digests is used in detection. The advantage of our method is that it enables the data owner to safely delegate the detection operation to a semihonest provider without revealing the sensitive data to the provider.

However, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks launch large volumes of traffic and consume network bandwidth, thus degrading the quality of the delivered multimedia service. In this paper, we present a differentiated service protection framework consisting of anomaly traffic detection and resource management. Data mining based anomaly traffic detection is implemented at the host; whereas resource management is responsible for the allocation of network resources to the applications. Based on the deviation of the monitored traffic to the normal traffic, differentiated resources are allocated to the traffic. When suspicious traffic is detected, multimedia transmission reacts proactively via adjusting the transmission rate, which can avoid possible packet loss resulting from DoS bandwidth consumption, and thus provide better QoS. The impact of the traffic anomalies on the legitimate services can be mitigated, and the legitimate services can be protected. Simulation results show that better PSNR can be achieved for multimedia transmission during an attack in our proposed framework.","","1-4244-1016-9","1-4244-1017-7","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284956","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Data mining;Degradation;Protection;Quality of service;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web and internet services","DiffServ networks;data mining;multimedia communication;quality of service;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet multimedia transmission;anomaly traffic detection;data mining;denial-of-service attacks;differentiated resource allocation;differentiated service protection;multimedia service;network resource allocation;quality of service;resource management;suspicious traffic detection","","0","","9","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper, we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.","","0-7695-2108-8","","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286430","","Communication system security;Computer displays;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Protection","computer networks;cryptography;data communication;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;pattern matching;protocols;system monitoring","ProtoMon;anomaly-based detection;application-level protocols;attack detection;attack signatures;cryptographic protocol intrusion detection;encrypted sessions;information protection;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention;machine learning;monitoring process;normal system behavior;pattern matching;profile creation;protocol misuse;protocol response modification;signature-based detection;unauthorized access;unauthorized manipulation","","5","1","28","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This growth necessitates proper defense mechanisms. Intrusion detection systems play an important role in detecting and disrupting attacks before they can compromise software. Multivariant execution is an intrusion detection mechanism that executes several slightly different versions, called variants, of the same program in lockstep. The variants are built to have identical behavior under normal execution conditions. However, when the variants are under attack, there are detectable differences in their execution behavior. At runtime, a monitor compares the behavior of the variants at certain synchronization points and raises an alarm when a discrepancy is detected. We present a monitoring mechanism that does not need any kernel privileges to supervise the variants. Many sources of inconsistencies, including asynchronous signals and scheduling of multithreaded or multiprocess applications, can cause divergence in behavior of variants. These divergences cause false alarms. We provide solutions to remove these false alarms. Our experiments show that the multivariant execution technique is effective in detecting and preventing code injection attacks. The empirical results demonstrate that dual-variant execution has on average 17 percent performance overhead when deployed on multicore processors.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5714703","Intrusion detection;multivariant execution;n-variant execution;system call.","Kernel;Monitoring;Multicore processing;Security;Synchronization;Writing","computer crime;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems","asynchronous signal;attack detection;code injection attack;computer systems attack;dual variant execution;false alarm;intrusion detection system;monitoring mechanism;multicore processor;multiprocess application;multithreaded application;multivariant execution technique;replicated execution","","5","1","45","","2011-02-17","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the end, directions for future work are discussed.","","0-7803-8243-9","","10.1109/ICISIP.2004.1287662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287662","","Communication system security;Computer science;Data security;Educational institutions;Event detection;Information security;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Scalability;Time measurement","data communication;multi-agent systems;open systems;security of data","communication mechanism;distributed intrusion detection system;independent agents;open system","","1","1","10","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE International Conference on","20070904","2007","","","190","195","In this paper, a framework is proposed to defend against Internet bandwidth attacks with traffic resource management to provide service for legitimate users. Denial of service (DoS) is one of the major bandwidth attacks in the Internet. A DoS attack generates a large volume of traffic to consume the network bandwidth and degrade the service that legitimate users can obtain. Incoming traffic to the server is monitored and features are extracted for each connection. Anomaly detection technique is used to detect the abnormal traffic. Based on the outcome of the anomaly detection technique, the proposed resource management approach allocates suitable bandwidth. With the early detection of DoS, the attack traffic can be isolated. The bandwidth occupied by the attack can be reduced and protected for the legitimate users. Performances are compared under different attack loads with and without resource management. Simulation results show that bandwidth can be greatly saved from an attack and the service for the legitimate users can be protected during an attack.","","1-4244-1500-4","1-4244-1500-4","10.1109/IRI.2007.4296619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296619","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;computer network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet bandwidth attacks;anomaly detection technique;denial of service;legitimate users;traffic resource management","","0","","14","","","13-15 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The typical insider in a DMS already has access to documents and hence, his capabilities for information leakage are much higher. In this work, we address an important, yet unexplored problem of masquerading users in a DMS, a threat for which the DMS inherently has no protection. We approach the problem by monitoring the pattern and mannerism of user actions on documents and building a profile of each user using the resulting logs. In order to illustrate our ideas, we built user profiles of 41 users working on Microsoft Word and applied two algorithms, viz., IPAM and NaÃ¯ve Bayes to distinguish between them. When supplied with appropriately interpreted command sequences of a DMS, IPAM was able to distinguish between users effectively, while NaÃ¯ve Bayes failed to produce any meaningful results.

We have mainly considered TCP flow because most of the Internet application uses it as a transport protocol. Traditionally, TCP scan traffic detection uses either flag values in the TCP packet header or statistical properties of the connection parameter like number of failed connection attempts. In this paper, we present a novel behaviour analysis of TCP traffic, where by using the flow characteristics, we identify anomalies and scan activities in a network or host.

Fates views the monitored network as a collection of individual hosts instead of as a single autonomous entity and uses dynamic, individual threshold for each monitored host, such that it can differentiate between characteristics of individual hosts and independently assess their threat to the network. Each packet to and from a monitored host is analyzed with an adaptive and efficient charging scheme that considers the packet's type, number of occurrences, source, and destination. The resulting charge is applied to the individual hosts' threat assessment, providing pinpointed analysis of anomalous activities. We use various datasets to validate Fates's ability to distinguish scanning behavior from benign traffic in real time.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-1251-8","978-1-4244-1251-8","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317884","Anomaly-based Detection;Network-based Intrusion Detection System","Computer science;Entropy;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Monitoring;Real time systems;Signal detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer network management;real-time systems;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Fates real-time anomaly-based network intrusion detection system;network host monitoring;network traffic;real-time anomaly detection","","0","","25","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its main goal is to classify activities into two major categories: (1) normal activities and (2) intrusive activities. Both types of activities are hard to predict as the boundaries cannot be well defined and a prediction process may generate false alarms. Many anomaly-based intrusion detection systems have experienced this. However, with fuzzy logic, the false alarm rate in determining intrusive activities can be reduced. This paper proposes a One-rule Genetic-Fuzzy classifier system to generate the fuzzy rules that are capable of detecting intrusive activities by using Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA is now a viable alternative for the detection of malicious intrusions. They tune the fuzzy membership functions and select an appropriate set of features. After that they generate a proper discrimination rule. Typically, a set of fuzzy rules (fuzzy classifiers) is used to define the normal and abnormal behavior in a computer network. The main goal of this work is to (1) evolve comprehensible rule(s) that improves the classification rate, (2) produce shorter rules, and (3) perform automatic feature selection according to the complexity of data. The proposed system combines both anomaly-based intrusion detection and misuse detection. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set [12] demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible. In the paper a performance of the evolved fuzzy classifiers with a classification accuracy of 92% is presented.","","978-1-4673-0088-9","","10.1109/CSAE.2012.6272759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6272759","Fuzzy Logic;Genetic algorithms;Intrusion detection","","","","","0","","18","","","25-27 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Not all communications are credible and malpractice can arise anywhere, anytime. If the normal traffic is slightly modified to delude the intrusion detection system, then the traditional systems might not be able to discern the same effectively. Thus, a system that could detect and ferret out the novel attacks has been proposed. Since any number of users can use a web page, maintaining the availability of the resources and allocating them to the active users as per their need is very essential. The multi-thread concept is used to share the resources that each client can use. Attribute Selection Algorithm is used as the feature extraction algorithm in weka, to yield those relevant features pertaining to the user's request and helps in achieving a more accurate result. Memory efficiency is brought in with the cascading binary search tree. The patterns are efficiently stored and hence the search for the presence of an attack is accomplished effectively. An Intrusion Detection System which is memory efficient and effective enough in detecting attacks and reducing the false positives is thus proposed.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2013.6844277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844277","Anomaly;Classifier;Intrusion Detection System;Memory Efficiency;Multi-Threading","Binary search trees;Computer crime;Databases;Feature extraction;Instruction sets;Intrusion detection;Memory management","Internet;multi-threading;pattern matching;security of data","Web-enabled world;attack detection;attribute selection algorithm;false positives reduction;feature extraction algorithm;intrusion detection system;memory efficacious pattern matching;memory efficiency;multithread concept","","0","","38","","","25-27 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NIDSs inspect all packets to find attacks and abnormal behaviors. In addition, NIDSs keep the state of each flow to increase accuracy of detection. Performing packet inspection in today's high-speed networks is hard, or even impossible and keeping per flow state is not scalable. Large-scale attacks such as DoS attack usually produce many flows and keeping their state requires many resources. Consequently, approaches that investigate behavior of communication patterns in flow-level - instead of packet inspection - are taken into consideration. Different algorithms and techniques have been proposed for flow-based detection of DoS attacks. Recently, approaches based on data streaming algorithms have attracted much attention. These algorithms enable the analysis and processing of large data sets by constructing a compact synopsis of input data. This synopsis can be used to answer certain queries over the original data. Sketch is one of these synopsis structures which different intrusion detection systems are proposed by using it. Most of these proposed approaches have good performance if just one flow has anomalous characteristics. But if there are several abnormal flows, sketches encounter difficulties. This paper for the first time provides a framework to avoid such problems in presence of several abnormal flows. The proposed framework rearranges hash functions in an appropriate data structures and overcomes such problems in presence of several abnormal flows.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2014.6999702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999702","DoS attack;Sketch;heavy hitter;intrusion detection;related counters","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Computer crime;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Radiation detectors","computer network security;data structures;query processing","DoS attack;DoS detection application;NIDS;anomalous characteristic;communication link;compact data synopsis;data set processing;data streaming algorithm;data structure;flow-based detection;hash function;high-speed network;multiple heavy-hitter identification;network intrusion detection system;packet inspection;per flow state;query answering;sketch-based framework efficiency","","0","","9","","","20-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One class of IDS, called signature-based network IDSs, monitors network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behavior as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies have reported that IDSs can generate thousands of alarms a day, many of which are false alarms. The problem often lies in the low accuracy of IDS signatures. It is therefore important to have more accurate signatures in order to reduce the number of false alarms. One part of the false alarm problem is the inability of IDSs to verify attacks (i.e. distinguish between successful and failed attacks). If IDSs were able to accurately verify attacks, this would reduce the number of false alarms a network administrator has to investigate. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a data mining algorithm to automatically generate IDS verification rules. We show that this automated approach is effective in reducing the number of false alarms when compared to other widely used and maintained IDSs.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721565","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Application software;Computer security;Databases;Drives;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Protocols;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;digital signatures;program verification","data mining algorithm;intrusion detection verification rule;malicious behavior;network traffic monitoring;signature-based network security","","3","","22","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is needed to detect intrusion by transform a set of features space to a lower dimension space retaining the variability of the original data from any change. But PCA doesn't take the classes into account and is created for analyzing steady state processes, thus it is not able to handle any dynamic process, where wire, wireless and mobile traffic is dynamic (non-linear) therefore PCA is not feasible. In this research Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is proposed to reveal the variables in data. We are intending to introduce superior algorithm to frame Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) in a heuristic fashion, this achievement will be explored in properties of emerging platforms such as smartness and mobility, and we need to merge DPCA and LSA to reveal semantics over variables; supported by ontology. Then using ID3 data mining and Artificial Intelligence showed how the intruding packets were detected and analyzed, this analysis has taken the stationary networks. The new stage of this research will take the mobility into account. So for, a group of algorithms have been created and correlated in parallel and serial configurations to present the proposed vision for NIDS. The results obtained from proposed system showing that accuracy and detection rate of ID3 classifiers is higher with (DPCA and LSA) than with traditional feature reduction methods.","","","","10.1109/CEEC.2014.6958547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958547","DM;DPCA;IDS;LSA;PCA;SVD","Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Semantics;Testing;Training","artificial intelligence;data mining;principal component analysis;security of data","DPCA;ID3 data mining;LSA;NIDS;artificial intelligence;dynamic principle component analysis;feature reduction method;latent semantic analysis;network intrusion detection system;ontology;parallel configuration;serial configuration;steady state process","","0","","9","","","25-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this type of attacks, malicious clients send a large number of HTTP-GET requests to the target Web server automatically. Since these HTTP-GET requests have legitimate formats and are sent via normal TCP connections, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can not detect them. In this paper, we propose HTTP-GET flood detection techniques based on analysis of page access behavior. We propose two detection algorithms, one is focusing on a browsing order of pages and the other is focusing on a correlation with browsing time to page information size. We implement detection techniques and evaluate attack detection rates, i.e., false positive and false negative.

To be effective, such systems are expected to precisely detect intrusions (high true positive rate) while limiting the number of false alarms (low false positive rate). However, there exists a natural trade-off between detecting all anomalies (at the expense of raising alarms too often), and missing anomalies (but not issuing any false alarms). The parameters of a detection system play a central role in this trade-off, since they determine how responsive the system is to an intrusion attempt. Despite the importance of properly tuning the system parameters, the literature has put little emphasis on the topic, and the task of adjusting such parameters is usually left to the expertise of the system manager or expert IT personnel. In this paper, we present an autonomic approach for tuning the parameters of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in case of SSH traffic. We propose a procedure that aims to automatically tune the system parameters and, by doing so, to optimize the system performance.
