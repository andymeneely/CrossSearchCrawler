Computer systems used within critical infrastructures to control physical functions are not immune to the threat of cyber attacks and may be potentially vulnerable. Tailoring an intrusion detection system to the specifics of critical infrastructures can significantly improve the security of such systems. The IDS-NNM - intrusion detection system using neural network based modeling, is presented in this paper. The main contributions of this work are: 1) the use and analyses of real network data (data recorded from an existing critical infrastructure); 2) the development of a specific window based feature extraction technique; 3) the construction of training dataset using randomly generated intrusion vectors; 4) the use of a combination of two neural network learning algorithms - the error-back propagation and Levenberg-Marquardt, for normal behavior modeling. The presented algorithm was evaluated on previously unseen network data. The IDS-NNM algorithm proved to be capable of capturing all intrusion attempts presented in the network communication while not generating any false alerts.","1098-7576","978-1-4244-3548-7","978-1-4244-3553-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5178592","Anomaly Intrusion Detection System;Control System;Neural Network","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Communication system control;Communication system security;Computer networks;Control systems;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","computer crime;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","Levenberg-Marquardt learning rule;SCADA;computer systems;control system resiliency;control system security;critical infrastructures;cyber attacks;error-back propagation;hackers;intrusion detection system;intrusion vectors;malware;neural network based modeling;neural network learning algorithms;normal behavior modeling;nuclear plant;window based feature extraction technique","","22","","23","","","14-19 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security measures, such as authentication and encryption, can be used for reducing the possibilities of attacks. But they are far from sufficiency. Intrusion detection is the second mechanism to detect the attacks. Anomaly IDS can be used to detect the abnormal behaviors of the network to find some unknown attacking patterns. This paper proposed an anomaly detection method using a simple Hide Markov Model to detect the abnormal network behaviors. We build a Hide Markov Model by supposing that all the network behaviors are completely normal. If observation sequence does not match the model, we conclude that the behavior is not normal, that is to say, there is an attack.","","978-1-4244-3708-5","978-1-4244-3709-2","10.1109/WICOM.2010.5601345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601345","","Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring","ad hoc networks;hidden Markov models;mobile radio","MANET;anomaly detection system;hide Markov model;intrusion detection","","0","","6","","","23-25 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software applications frequently fail to identify so many signatures through comparisons at very high network speeds. Bloom filters are one of the main multi-hashing schemes utilized in hardware to support this level of security. Nevertheless Bloom filters consume significant power to store, retrieve and lookup virus signatures owing to many hash function computations required to index to the memory. We present a novel lookup technique and architecture to decrease the power consumption of multi-hashing schemes, predominantly Bloom filters, in hardware. The theoretical analysis has shown that power gain achieved through new lookup technique can go up to 90%. Simulation results with three different classes of the hash functions embedded into the Bloom filter have indicated that power consumption of the Bloom filters can be considerably decreased by employing the low power lookup technique","","0-7695-2533-4","","10.1109/ISVLSI.2006.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1602437","","Application software;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Power filters","computer networks;cryptography;digital filters;low-power electronics;table lookup;telecommunication security","Bloom filters;hash functions;low power lookup technique;multihashing network;multihashing schemes","","4","","10","","","2-3 March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most network security techniques employed by the IDS and IPS depend mainly on packet behavior for detection. This work applies a quantitative approach based on Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) detection rules with the hope of reducing the high false positive and false negative rates. The entire system has been represented by a mathematical model of a discrete binary communication channel having two possible input messages and two possible output symbols. The network under study is assumed to have only one entry point (sender) for now, with a number of nodes (receivers). Also, all normal operational packets are referred to as normal packets and any other packets are referred to as abnormal packets. The analysis strategy used here is anomaly detection. The developed algorithm initially calculates the a priori probabilities for the normal and abnormal packets both at the sender and entry ends. These values are further used in finding the threshold probabilities to be compared to the corresponding probabilities of future incoming packets. MATLAB was used in coding the developed algorithm. This work will be expanded by modeling the entire system as a continuous binary communication channel and also by considering multiple entry points as future works, with the intension of improving the results obtained so far.","","978-1-4244-1109-2","978-1-4244-1110-8","10.1109/ISCE.2007.4382164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4382164","","Communication channels;Communication system security;Communication systems;Communications technology;Data security;Estimation theory;Failure analysis;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Signal detection","computer networks;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security","anomaly detection;continuous binary communication channel;discrete binary communication channel;intrusion detection systems;intrusion prevention systems;maximum a posteriori detection rule;network security;signal detection;signal estimation","","0","","9","","","20-23 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address localization attacks against ITM systems in which an attacker impairs the effectiveness of ITM systems by identifying the locations of ITM monitors. We propose an information-theoretic framework for the modeling of localization attacks as communication channels. Based on the information-theoretic model, we generalize all existing attacks as ldquotemporal attacksrdquo, derive closed formulae of their performance, and propose an effective detection approach. The information-theoretic model also inspires a new attack called a spatial attack and motivates the corresponding detection approach.

The amount of data that must be analyzed by NIDS is too large. Prior studies developed feature selection and feature extraction techniques to reduce the size of data. None has focused on finding exactly by how much the dataset should be reduced. Dimensionality reduction is a field in machine learning that consists on mapping high dimensional data into lower dimension while preserving important features of the original dataset. Dimensionality reduction techniques have been used to reduce the amount of data in applications such as speech signals, digital photographs, fMRI scans, DNA microarrays, Hyper spectral data. The purpose of this paper is to find the finite amount of data required for successful intrusion detection. This evaluation is necessary to improve the efficiency of NIDS in identifying existing attack patterns and recognizing new intrusion in real-time. Two dimensionality reduction techniques are used one linear technique (Principal Component Analysis) and one non-linear technique (Multidimensional Scaling). Data is then submitted to two classification algorithms J48 (C.45) and Naïve Bayes. This study was conducted using the KDD Cup 99 data.

This paper presents the ID-Trace Management Platform, an extension of the simple network management protocol infrastructure based on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) script management information base (Script MIB) to support distributed stateful intrusion detection in enterprise networks. It provides mechanisms allowing a management station to delegate security-related tasks to mid-level managers (MLMs) that, in turn, interact with monitoring and action agents to execute these tasks. Protocol trace specification language specifications are used by the MLMs to program monitoring agents that sniff packets on the network comparing their signatures to those of known attack signatures. With the information gathered from the monitoring process, the MLMs may execute procedures via the action agents (Java, Tcl, or Perl scripts), enabling the automation of several security tasks (including reactive and proactive tasks). The platform also provides notification mechanisms (traps) so that MLMs can report the occurrence of major events to the management station.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2005.854116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514526","Computer network management;computer network security;site security monitoring","Automation;Computerized monitoring;Engineering management;IP networks;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Java;Protocols;Specification languages","Internet;Java;authorisation;business communication;computer network management;digital signatures;program verification;software agents;specification languages;system monitoring;telecommunication security;transport protocols","ID-trace management platform;IDS system;IETF;Internet engineering task force;MLM;SNMP-based platform;action agent;distributed stateful intrusion detection;enterprise network;known attack signature;mid-level manager;notification mechanism;program monitoring agent;protocol trace specification language;script MIB;script management information base;simple network management protocol;site security monitoring;sniff packet;time-consuming configuration","","6","","19","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SNORT alerts system administrators whenever it receives packets of information that match predetermined signatures contained in the SNORT ruleset, thereby protecting network sytems. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this design, SNORT operates at the packet level and thereby has no concept of the specific properties of the network it is trying to protect. This paper provides the analysis of NEFCLASS and JRip which, upon taking SNORT alerts as input and learning from training, attempts to reduce false-positive and negative alerts sent to the system administrator. The major drawback of SNORT is the amount of false alerts generated by the SNORT engine, which must then be analyzed and classified by system administrators.

It consolidates many physical servers into a single physical server saving the hardware resources, physical space, power-consumption, air conditioning capacity and man power to manage the servers. Thus virtualization assists “Green Technology”. Live migration is an essential feature of virtualization that allows transition of a running virtual machine from one system to another without halting the virtual machine. Live migration extends the list of benefits server virtualization provides. Almost all virtualization softwares now include support for live migration of virtual machine. Live migration is in its infant stage where security of live migration is yet to be analyzed. The usages of live migration and security exploits over it have both increased over time. The security concern of live migration is a major factor for its adoption by the IT industry. In this paper we discuss the attack model on the virtualization system and design and implement a security framework for secure live migration of virtual machines. The framework is an integrated security solution that addresses role based access policy, network intrusion, firewall protection and encryption for secure live migration process.","","978-1-4799-2432-5","","10.1109/ICACCI.2013.6637178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637178","inter VM attacks;live migration;live migration attack model;live migration security;reactive IDS;role based access control policy","Access control;Cryptography;Intrusion detection;Servers;Virtual machining;Virtualization","authorisation;cryptography;firewalls;green computing;virtual machines;virtualisation","cost-saving benefit;encryption;firewall protection;green technology;live migration security framework;network intrusion;resource utilization benefit;role based access control policy;security concern;server virtualization;virtual machines;virtualization feature;virtualization softwares;virtualization system","","2","","19","","","22-25 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common design goal of reactive, proactive, and hybrid ad hoc routing protocols is to faithfully route packets from a source node to a destination node while maintaining a satisfactory level of service in a resource-constrained environment. Detecting malicious nodes in an open ad hoc network in which participating nodes have no previous security associations presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional wired networks. Traffic monitoring in wired networks is usually performed at switches, routers and gateways, but an ad hoc network does not have these types of network elements where the intrusion detection system (IDS) can collect and analyze audit data for the entire network. A number of neighbor-monitoring, trust-building, and cluster-based voting schemes have been proposed in the research to enable the detection and reporting of malicious activity in ad hoc networks. The resources consumed by ad hoc network member nodes to monitor, detect, report, and diagnose malicious activity, however, may be greater than simply rerouting packets through a different available path. This paper presents a method for determining conditions under which critical nodes should be monitored, describes the details of a critical node test implementation, presents experimental results, and offers a new approach for conserving the limited resources of an ad hoc network IDS","","0-7695-2549-0","","10.1109/SECPERU.2006.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644271","IDS;MANET;edge-cut;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc network;security;vertex-cut.","Ad hoc networks;Data security;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Network topology;Routing protocols;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","ad hoc networks;mobile communication;routing protocols;security of data;telecommunication security","MANET intrusion detection systems;ad hoc routing protocols;critical node detection;mobile ad hoc network","","3","","16","","","29-29 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We assess the strengths and weaknesses of many design options, like the utility of different features, the construction of feature histograms, the modeling and clustering algorithms, and the detection of deviations.

We evaluate histogram-based anomaly detection and compare it to previous approaches using collected network traffic traces.

Several bot detection approaches have been proposed which can be classified as either host-based or network-based. A hybrid approach which mitigates the disadvantages of the previous two approaches is proposed here. The proposed method aims to identify bots on a single host by looking at the network traffic generated by the host. The detection method is designed for HTTP traffic. A characterization of normal HTTP traffic as well as bot traffic is initially done using features extracted from network packets. A Neural Network Classifier is trained using these traffic features and later used to classify unlabeled traffic as benign or malicious. A normal traffic profile is first used to filter out packets to commonly accessed destinations thereby reducing the workload on the classifier. Stealthy bots which communicate at large time intervals of up to 32 hours are also detected. 120 bots samples were used to evaluate the system. The experimental results demonstrate a high detection rate of 97.4% and a very low false positive rate of 2.5%.

This paper proposes a novel online method that constructs connections from the massive data flow for evaluating IDS models. The proposed method overcomes this challenge by using a queuing concept of dynamic window size. It captures network traffic and hosts events constantly and handles them synchronously within time slot windows inside the queue in order to construct connection vectors based on certain features. We have evaluated the method in offline mode using DARPA dump data flow and in online mode using a simulated network at the university campus. In addition, we have evaluated our IDS model using the constructed connections to proof the feasibility and plausibility of the proposed method in IDS area. The performance evaluation confirms that, the proposed method is able to operate in offline as well online modes efficiently.

In recent years, the HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. Due to the high false alarm rate in the classical IDS based on HMM, this paper proposes a Fuzzy approach to the Hidden Markov Models (HMM), called Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models (FHMM). It is introduced with the Fuzzy logic. The system has the simplicity and flexibility to adapt pattern changes. With the IDS based on FHMM, its robustness and accurate rate of detection model are greatly improved. For these reasons, a new intrusion detection method based on FHMM was proposed in this paper. The proposed method differs from STIDE in that only one profile is created for the normal behavior of all applications using short sequences of system calls issued by the normal runs of the programs. Subsequent to this, HMM with simple states along with STIDE is used to categorize an unknown programpsilas sequence of system calls to be either normal or an intrusion. The results on 1998 DARPA data show that the our method results in low false positive rate with high detection rate.","","978-1-4244-1717-9","978-1-4244-1718-6","10.1109/ICIEA.2008.4582476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4582476","","Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Sequences;Surveillance","fuzzy logic;hidden Markov models;security of data","fuzzy HMM;fuzzy logic;hidden Markov model;intrusion detection;pattern recognition","","4","","12","","","3-5 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.","","978-0-7695-3495-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046","","Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server","decision trees;security of data","behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length","","3","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method confers a near-zero susceptibility to triggering by external loud noises.

Then RLS (recursive least square) filter is used to predict IF flows. After that, a statistical method using residual filtered process is proposed to detect anomalies. Finally we respectively apply the method to three types of traffics: IF flows, input links and output links within a router, and compare the anomaly detection results using ROC curves.

The intrusion features are represented as graph-ere nodes, with the edges between them denoting the adding of the next feature. Ants traverse through the graph to add nodes until the stopping criterion is satisfied. The fisher discrimination rate is adopted as the heuristic information for ants' traversal. In order to avoid training of a large number of SVM classifier, the least square based SVM estimation is adopted. Initially, the SVM is trained based on grid search method to obtain discrimination function using the training data based on all features available. Then the feature subset produced during the ACO search process is evaluated based on their abilities to reconstruct the reference discriminative function using linear least square estimation. Finally SVM is retrained using the train data based on the obtained optimal feature subset to obtain intrusion detection model. The MIT's KDD Cup 99 dataset is used to evaluate our present method, the results clearly demonstrate that the method can be an effective way for intrusion feature selection and detection.","","0-7803-9091-1","","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527615","Network intrusion detection;ant colony optimization;feature selection;machine learning;support vector machines","Ant colony optimization;Computer vision;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Least squares approximation;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;optimisation;search problems;security of data;support vector machines","SVM training;ant colony optimization;discrimination function;grid search method;least square based SVM estimation;machine learning;network intrusion feature detection;network intrusion feature selection;support vector machine","","5","","12","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Event Correlation for Intrusion Detection Systems","Dwivedi, N.; Tripathi, A.","","Computational Intelligence & Communication Technology (CICT), 2015 IEEE International Conference on","20150402","2015","","","133","139","Intrusion Detection System (IDS) have grown into a mature and feature rich technology that provides advanced features to detect intrusion and provide responses. It also allows the management system for security analysis by monitoring, configuring and analyzing the intrusion data. A better understanding of alerts by using a general framework and infrastructure for detecting intrusions through event correlation strategy minimizes the amount of data generated. Event correlation techniques are needed for two reasons. First, network attack detection is usually based on information or data received from distributed sensors, e.g. intrusion detection systems. During attacks, the generated amount of events is hard to handle and so it is difficult to evaluate the current attack situation for a larger network. Thus, the concept of event or alert correlation has been introduced. Event correlation paints a picture of what is now being called as network or cyber situational awareness and tries to guide the security administrator on the actions that he can take to mitigate the crisis. The aim of the event correlation for intrusion detection system (IDS) is to improve security by correlating events and reduce the workload on an IDS analyst. This correlation has been achieved by getting together similar alerts, thus allowing the analyst to only look at a few alerts instead of hundreds or thousands of alerts. In this paper, we correlate the results of SNORT Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with SEC (Simple Event Correlator) by taking the input from the MIT DARPA (Defense advanced Research Projects Agency) dataset. The alerts generated from Snort are very large and so it is difficult for the administrators to identify them. Here we correlate the alerts based on same name coming from different IP address. This correlation removes the duplication of alerts and thus reduces the information overload on the administrator.","","978-1-4799-6022-4","","10.1109/CICT.2015.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078682","Correlation;DARPA;IDS;SEC;events","Computers;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors","IP networks;computer network security;correlation methods","Defense advanced Research Projects Agency;IDS;IP address;MIT DARPA dataset;SEC;SNORT intrusion detection system;alert correlation;cyber situational awareness;distributed sensors;event correlation strategy;management system;network attack detection;security administrator;security analysis;simple event correlator;workload reduction","","0","","22","","","13-14 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Subsequently, the system detects suspicious activities by searching the “normal behavior DNA sequence” through string matching. Conversely, string matching is a computationally intensive task and can be converted into a potential bottleneck without high-speed processing. Furthermore, conventional software implemented string matching algorithms have not kept pace with the ever increasing network speeds. As a result, we adopt a monitoring phase that is hardware implemented with the intention that DNA pattern matching is performed at wire-speed. Finally, we provide the details of our FPGA implementation of the bioinformatics-based string matching technique. The associative string processor (ASP) is an associative memory-based micro-architecture with long fixed-length words that can be partially searched. We show that the proposed micro-architecture can handle fixed-length patterns at a rate of more than one character per cycle.","","978-1-4244-7716-6","","10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5586949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5586949","CAM;DNA computing;FPGA;Network Intrusion Detection;anomaly identification;bioinformatics;pattern matching","Artificial neural networks;DNA","biocomputing;computer network security;content-addressable storage;field programmable gate arrays;string matching","DNA based anomaly identification system;DNA pattern matching;DNA sequence;FPGA implementation;anomaly intrusion detection system;associative memory based microarchitecture;associative string processor;bioinformatics;genetic material;network traffic patterns;string matching","","0","","15","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In terms of security perspectives, communication via wireless links makes mobile ad hoc networks more vulnerable to attacks because any one can join and move the networks at any time. Particularly, in mobile ad hoc networks one of very common attack is packet dropping attack through the malicious node (s). This paper developed an anomaly based fuzzy intrusion detection system to detect the packet dropping attack from mobile ad hoc networks and this proposed solution also save the resources of mobile nodes in respect to remove the malicious nodes. For implementation point of view, qualnet simulator 6.1 and sugeno-type fuzzy inference system are used to make the fuzzy rule base for analyzing the results.

Nevertheless, even if this high-grade material is installed, it can happen in certain cases that apparently invisible peripheral influences are the cause of important electrical effects. This paper describes a practical case experienced in 1999 where a coincidental combination of seaside conditions and a local desert wind strongly interfered in the physics of a capacitive electrostatic field detector","0885-8985","","","10.1109/62.949529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=949529","","Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society;Cable insulation;Capacitance;Detectors;Electrostatics;Hardware;Pattern recognition;Rain;Security;Wires","access control;capacitive sensors;safety systems;signal detection","PERIFELD-M detector;capacitive detector;digital processing;electrical effects;electrostatic field detectors;intrusion detection system;invisible peripheral influences;local desert wind;microprocessor controlled evaluation unit;outdoor influences;perimeter sensor;seaside conditions;security fence;signal recognition;unstable condition;unwanted false alarm rates","","0","","13","","","Sep 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With maximizing a projection index, Projection Pursuit uses Genetic Algorithm to search for the optimal projection direction, projects network connections records from high-dimensional space into 1-dimensional space, and uses the projection values to analyze the data structure and classify the type of intrusion. This intrusion detection classification model not only cuts down the computing complexity in the process of network connection records, but also opens out non-linear structure not like in latent semantics analysis only discovering linear structure, and the results of classification can also be visualized.

However, there is a weak anomaly detection problem among the existing system call based intrusion detection systems: the pattern value range of abnormal system call sequences generated by attacks always overlaps to that by normal behaviors so it is difficult to accurately classify the sequences falling into the overlap area by a unique threshold. Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.","","978-1-4799-2763-0","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743958","Intrusion Detection;Multi-module System;Top-k Prediction;Viterbi Algorithm","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","computer network security;pattern classification","TkVV algorithm;Viterbi algorithm;abnormal system call sequences;computer networks;multimodule anomaly detection system;scalable linear algorithm;sequence classification;system call based intrusion detection systems;system protection;top-k future system call prediction;top-k prediction based multimodule;top-k variation","","0","","16","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, as the size of pattern dictionaries continues to grow, such large dictionaries can be stored in external DRAM only. The increased memory latency and limited bandwidth pose new challenges to FPGA-based designs, and the lack of spatial and temporal locality in data access also leads to low utilization of memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a multi-core architecture on FPGA to address these challenges. We adopt the popular Aho-Corasick (AC-opt) algorithm for our string matching engine. Utilizing the data access feature in this algorithm, we design a specialized BRAM buffer for the cores to exploit a data reuse existing in such applications. Several design optimization techniques are utilized to realize a simple design with high clock rate for the string matching engine. An implementation of a 2-core system with one shared BRAM buffer on a Virtex-5 LX155 achieves up to 3.2 Gbps throughput on a 64 MB state transition table stored in DRAM. Performance of systems with more cores is also evaluated for this architecture, and a throughput of over 5.5 Gbps can be obtained for some application scenarios.","","978-0-7695-3716-0","","10.1109/FCCM.2009.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290944","FPGA;Multi-core Architecture;String Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Design optimization;Dictionaries;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Random access memory;Throughput","DRAM chips;buffer storage;field programmable gate arrays;performance evaluation;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BRAM buffer;FPGA multicore architecture;Virtex-5 LX155;data reuse;external DRAM;field programmable gate arrays;large dictionary string matching;memory latency;string matching engine;system performance","","5","","19","","","5-7 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many solutions have been proposed to secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection systems with many different techniques such as data mining approaches are employed to maximize the detection rate of intrusions while reducing false alarm rate. For instance, many clustering techniques are recommended which segregate normal and abnormal data in IDSs. Clustering methods put emphasis on finding differences and similarities of traffic sessions to categorize each one in its corresponding groups. These groups are represented by their assigned labels. Later, these labels are used to predict the type of the incoming network traffic. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to use in intrusion detection systems, named CluSID. The major contribution of CluSID is using information theory for taking full advantages of clustering techniques. The main logic behind CluSID is to use non-uniform gain functions for network traffic features in order to improve the accuracy of clustering process. To this end, we apply information theory concepts for moving center of clusters to the most important areas in the domain of the selected features. The results clearly show a raise in detection rate of CluSID in most of the attack categories in comparison to KDD CUP'99 Winner and simple clustering methods. The increase in detection rate of proposed system is about 25 percent.","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635546","Clustering;Entropy;Information Theory;Intrusion Detecfion System","Clustering methods;Communication system security;Data mining;Data security;IP networks;Information security;Information theory;Intrusion detection;Logic;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;security of data","Internet;clustering scheme;data mining;information theory;intrusion detection system;network traffic","","1","","19","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Metaheuristic optimization algorithms have the potential to achieve global optimal solution. In this paper, two metaheuristic algorithms, Cuckoo and PSOGSA, are examined to optimize the interconnection weights of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. This optimized MLP is evaluated with two different flow-based data sets. We then compare the performance of these algorithms.

Many intrusion detection models are proposed by the researchers and most of them are promising. How-ever, the problem in mobile ad-hoc environment is that communication and power resources are very limited. Thus, any additional features which need to be implemented in this environment must be as efficient as possible. This paper presents a comparison study between the co-operative detection model and the aggregative detection model to evaluate the efficiency of resource usage.

In particular, a bio-inspired technique called gene expression programming (GEP) is integrated with artificial immune system (AIS) in detector representation. In addition, inspired by the avidity model of immunology, this paper also defines new avidity/affinity functions (corresponding to the metric for quantify the interactions between detector and antigens) that take the priorities of attribute into account. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm integrates both negative selection and positive selection with a balance factor k to assign appropriate weights to self and non-self avidity. The well known KDD CUP'99 DATA set is used for performance evaluation. The results show that the intrusion detection based on AMCS provides a higher detection rate of DoS attack, a lower false alarm rate, and a lower detectors generation cost.

By doing this, the complex defense system cannot detect the attack traffic in time. In this paper, we propose a behavior based detection that can discriminate DDoS attack traffic from traffic generated by real users. By using Pearson's correlation coefficient, our comparable detection methods can extract the repeatable features of the packet arrivals. The extensive simulations were tested for the accuracy of detection. We then performed experiments with several datasets and our results affirm that the proposed method can differentiate traffic of an attack source from legitimate traffic with a quick response.

Filtering malicious traffic can be integrated with firewall hardware or software. Firecol act as an intrusion prevention system which prevent the network attack using IPS rules.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are indispensable, since traditional intrusion prevention technique such as authentication and encryption based approaches are not strong and effective enough to protect MANETs. In addition to intrusion prevention techniques, it is useful to deploy intrusion detection techniques as a second line of defence. The main function of Intrusion Detection System is to protect the resources from threats and attacks. This paper concentrates on the combination of An Advanced Grammatical evolution technique and Computer Security is evolved for the detection of known attacks against MAODV protocol.

In this work, we propose detection schemes that are suitable to detect in-band wormhole attacks. The first detection scheme uses the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). The SPRT has been proven to be an optimal detection test when the probability distributions of both normal and abnormal behaviors are given. Furthermore, we introduce non-parametric methods, which require no training and are more adaptive to mobile scenarios. The proposed detection schemes are implemented and evaluated using a 48-node testbed and a mobile ad-hoc network emulator at the Army Research Lab. The performance and detection accuracy of various schemes are compared, especially in the presence of congestion. We provide tradeoffs analyses among detection latency and probabilities of false alarms and missed detection.","","978-1-4244-2676-8","978-1-4244-2677-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753177","","Collaboration;Communication system traffic control;Delay;Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Routing;Sequential analysis;Statistical analysis;Testing","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;statistical distributions;telecommunication security","MANET;in-band wormhole attack;intrusion detection technique;mobile ad hoc network;nonparametric method;probability distribution;sequential probability ratio test;statistical method","","4","","13","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Virtualization is a technology that eliminates the “uniqueness” dependency by creating an abstraction layer between the hardware and the software that runs on it. The aim of virtualization is to centralize the information system for facilitating administrative task while improving scalability. Virtualization technology which allows more efficient use of existing physical hardware, as well as some advantages including cost reduction, labor loss and performance improvement, contains several innovations in security, especially in system security. Software applications such as antivirus, firewall, end point security installed on the servers to ensure system security causes performance loss on the network and servers. Hence, security applications must be implemented on virtualization layer (hypervisor, Virtual Machine Monitor) to cover all the virtual system.

Most of current hardware implementations have outstanding performance over software implementations.

This paper describes a novel FPGA-based pattern matching architecture using a recent hashing algorithm called Cuckoo Hashing. The proposed architecture features on-the-fly pattern updates without reconfiguration, more efficient hardware utilization, and higher performance. Through various algorithmic changes of Cuckoo Hashing, we can implement parallel pattern matching on SRAM-based FPGA. Our system can accommodate the latest Snort rule-set, an open source network intrusion detection/prevention system, and achieve the highest utilization in terms of SRAM per character and logic cells per character at 17 bits/character and 0.043 logic cells/character, respectively on major Xilinx Virtex architectures.

At each time, only M (1 ≤ M ≤ K) processes can be observed, and the observations from each chosen process follow two different distributions, depending on whether the process is normal or abnormal. Each anomalous process incurs a cost per unit time until its anomaly is identified and fixed. Switching across processes and state declarations are allowed at all times, while decisions are based on all past observations and actions. The objective is a sequential search strategy that minimizes the total expected cost incurred by all the processes during the detection process under reliability constraints. We develop index-type algorithms for the case with both known observation distributions and the case when the observation distributions have unknown parameters. We show that the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing the total expected cost as the error constraints approach zero.

Although numerous intrusion detection systems are available, yet it is not practical to install IDS in every virtual machine. In this paper, we argue that a virtual machine monitor (VMM) can support certain security functions that our proposed design can actively collect information directly from the VMM without installing an agent in the guest OS. In addition, bot could not aware of the existence of such detection agent in the VMM. The proposed detection mechanism takes both passive and active detection approaches that the passive detection agent lies in the VMM to examine the tainted data used by a bot to check against bot behavior profiles and the active detection agent that performs active bot fingerprinting can actively send specific stimulus to a guest and examine if there exists expected triggered behavior. In the real-world bot experiments, we show the passive detection agent can distinguish between bots and benign process with low false positive and false negative rates. Also, the result shows the active detection agent can detect a bot even when before it performs its malicious jobs. The proposed mechanism suites an enterprise having cloud environment well to defeat malware.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682703","bot;fingerprinting;hypervisor;intrusion detection","Conferences;Detectors;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","IDS;VMM;active bot fingerprinting;active detection approaches;bot behavior profiles;cloud security;cooperative botnet detection;cooperative botnet profiling;enterprise;guest OS;malicious jobs;malware;passive detection approaches;virtual machine monitor;virtualized environment","","0","","22","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
