In this paper, we propose a new approach to automated response called the Response and Recovery Engine (RRE). Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE applies attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. In addition, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort's alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.","","978-1-4244-4422-9","978-1-4244-4421-2","10.1109/DSN.2009.5270307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5270307","","Boolean functions;Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Engines;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Protection;Security;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","Markov processes;search engines;security of data;stochastic games;trees (mathematics)","Boolean logic;Markov decision process;Snort alerts;attack-response trees;game-theoretic intrusion response;networked computing systems;recovery engine;two-player Stackelberg stochastic game","","21","2","28","","","June 29 2009-July 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with normal requests, malevolent ones, generated by malicious processes running in one or more CPUs, could occur. A protection mechanism is therefore required to prevent injection of malicious instructions or data across the system. We propose a self-contained Network-on-Chip (NoC) firewall at the network interface (NI) layer which, by checking the physical address against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate processes running in a multicore SoC. To sustain high performance, we implement the firewall in hardware, with rule-checking performed at segment-level based on deny rules. Furthermore, to evaluate its impact, we develop a novel framework on top of gem5 simulation environment, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics (STNoC). Simulation tests include scenarios in which legitimate and malicious processes, running in different CPUs, request access to shared memory. Our results indicate that a firewall implementation at the NI can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both end-to-end network delay and power consumption. We also show that our coarse-grain firewall can prevent saturation of the on-chip network and performs better than fine-grain alternatives that perform rule checking at page-level. Simulation results are accompanied with field measurements performed on a Zedboard platform running Linux, whereas the NoC Firewall is implemented as a reconfigurable, memory-mapped device on top of AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric.","0278-0070","","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2448684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131504","Deny rules;MPSoC;Spidergon STNoC;Spidergon STNoC.;deny rules;firewall;network-on-chip;segment-level security","Hardware;Linux;Network interfaces;Nickel;Ports (Computers);Security;System-on-chip","firewalls;multiprocessing systems;network-on-chip","AMBA AXI4 interconnect fabric;I-O devices;Linux;MPSoC;STMicroelectronics;STNoC;Zedboard platform;coarse-grain firewall;commercial point-to-point interconnect;coupling ARM technology;deny rules;end-to-end network delay;gem5 simulation environment;malicious instructions;malicious processes;multicore SoC;multiprocessor system-on-chip;network interface layer;on-chip memory;on-chip network;physical address;physical resources;power consumption;protection mechanism;reconfigurable memory-mapped device;rule-checking;self-contained NoC firewall;self-contained network-on-chip firewall;untrusted CPU requests","","0","","28","","2015-06-23","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditionally, the approach taken to find attacks is to inspect the contents of every packet. However, packet inspection cannot easily be performed at high-speeds. Therefore, researchers and operators started investigating alternative approaches, such as flow-based intrusion detection. In that approach the flow of data through the network is analyzed, instead of the contents of each individual packet. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of current research in the area of flow-based intrusion detection. The survey starts with a motivation why flow-based intrusion detection is needed. The concept of flows is explained, and relevant standards are identified. The paper provides a classification of attacks and defense techniques and shows how flow-based techniques can be used to detect scans, worms, Botnets and (DoS) attacks.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2010.032210.00054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5455789","Botnets;DoS;Network flows;attacks;intrusion detection;scan;worms","","IP networks;computer network security;data flow analysis;invasive software","Botnets;DoS attacks;IP flow based intrusion detection;data flow;packet inspection;worms","","47","","82","","2010-04-26","Third Quarter 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing perimeter is layered of border routers, firewalls, IDS, IPS, VPN devices, software architecture over DMZs and subnets, beside server and host filters and antivirus applications. These are not fully customizable against adversaries in providing strong security framework. The current deployment nature of security perimeter where these layered components are prone to various egress and ingress nasty activities raises some serious questions. The traditional perimeters do not provide sufficient security to overcome these limitations in order to provide uncompromised security nodes [3][11][12]. To address security needs efficiently, at critical knots within a network, we introduce a security framework. The proposed framework focuses three key areas related to defense-in-depth; (1) maximizing synchronization among layered security services (2) modularizing various services for better endpoint security (3) reducing traffic while providing secure mechanism for encrypted updates in traditional networks.

As the transmission rate of Internet links is getting higher and higher, the speed of matching engines is required to be faster and faster. Existing deterministic finite automaton (DFA)-based approaches achieve high throughput at the expense of extremely expensive memory cost; therefore, they are not suitable for the scenarios where only limited on-chip memory resources are available. To achieve fast matching speed while controlling memory expense, in this paper, we propose Kangaroo, a compact string matching scheme that scans multiple characters each time by running multiple small-sized finite state machines in parallel. Specifically, Kangaroo processes k consecutive characters mostly in one cycle by accessing k different memories in parallel, where k is a predefined factor that can be tuned based on the requirement of applications. Kangaroo is memory efficient. Experimental evaluations on Snort and ClamAV rule sets show that a tenfold increase in speed can be practically achieved by a single Kangaroo matching engine with a reduced memory cost comparing with the state-of-the-art DFA-based approaches.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905731","Deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automaton;finite state machine","Automata;Buildings;Collaboration;Educational institutions;Engines;Silicon;Throughput","deterministic automata;finite state machines;string matching","ClamAV;DFA;Internet links;Kangaroo scheme;Snort;antivirus scanners;collaborative finite state machines;deterministic finite automaton;network intrusion detection system;on-chip memory resources;string matching","","1","","30","","2014-09-19","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Compared with traditional wireless networks, the industrial environment is harsher and more complex, which has a higher requirement for network security. Although cryptographic primitives can provide the capability to resist against the attacks from the external network, they can not address the problem caused by the internal failed or compromised field devices. In this paper, we propose a trust management scheme for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks to solve this problem. By utilizing the centralized network manager, we first provide the architecture of trust management to improve the security of the network. Then a trust computation model is proposed to evaluate the trust value of field devices. Finally, we compare the performance of our scheme with some classic trust management schemes.

Some redundant sample points and noisy points are firstly removed in this paper according to the distance in high-dimensional feature space. And K-nearest neighbor algorithm guarantees sample points removed is the noise points. Then the remaining sample points provide an SVM with high quality samples that likely to carry most of the support vectors(SVs) such that they maximize the benefit of learning the SVM. Because different network protocols have different attributes, which must affect the detection effect. This paper proposes cooperative network intrusion detection based on SVMs. Three types of detecting agents are generated according to TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol.

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a CTCP router prototype that is built on the Linux kernel. By redirecting all packets targeting at nonexistent or nonopen-to-public ports to a CTCP socket which pretends to be the original receivers, CTCP could confirm the real identification of the packet sources, collect suspicious traffic from them, and make an illusion that the scanned target ports are all open, thus renders port scanning an useless effort. Under CTCP architecture, external hosts only interacts with a secure CTCP router; therefore, any OS fingerprinting attempt and DoS/DDoS attack targeting at TCP/IP implementation bugs could be thwarted. Moreover, By further checking traffic originating from confirmed scanners, the CTCP router can actually identify buffer overflow attack traffic. Finally, the CTCP router solves the TCP connection hijacking problem by introducing an additional check on the sequence number filed of incoming packets. Despite providing a rich variety of protection, the CTCP architecture does not incur much overhead. On a 1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine with gigabit Ethernet interfaces, the throughput of the CTCP router is 420.3 Mbits/sec, whereas the throughput of a generic Linux router on the same hardware is only 409.1 Mbits/sec.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377240","","Computer crime;Fingerprint recognition;Internet;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;RAKE receivers;Sockets;TCPIP;Throughput","Internet;Linux;open systems;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","1.1 GHz Pentium-3 machine;CTCP router prototype;Internet;Linux kernel;OS fingerprinting;gigabit Ethernet interface;network security;transparent centralized TCP/IP architecture","","2","","39","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new key management method that the shared keys are dynamic updated for wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme loads two hash functions and an initial key into the base station, cluster heads, and sensor nodes. Every node including the cluster heads and sensor node authenticates its neighbor nodes with the initial key. Then every node establishes pair wise key with each of its neighbor node to ensure transmission secrecy. The pair wise keys are updated between node and its neighbors within a random interval time, which is triggered by the base station. The security of this scheme is analyzed and it shows that it is robust to the guessing attacks, replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and node capture attacks.

In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. Multi-objective PSO approach is used for feature selection from a set of 41 features and Random Forests (RF), a highly accurate and fast algorithm, is used for classification.

In recent years, the programmable hardware solutions have been proposed but they cannot deal with deep and large amount of pattern matching and are lack of flexibility when signatures are growing up.

In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal intrusion detection strategy in a network environment where multiple ID techniques are deployed. We first formulate a zero-sum attacker/defender game. The objective of the defender is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to the use of a particular ID technique) that maximizes his expected detection gain. In contrast, the objective of the attacker is to decide an optimal mixed strategy (i.e., a distribution over a set of strategies with each corresponding to a specific attack type or anomaly pattern) that minimizes his expected detection loss. The minmax theorem guarantees an optimal equilibrium strategy pair, which provides a valuable quantitative measure of the contributions from different ID techniques to the overall detection efficiency. Such information can assist security architects in understanding the effectiveness of these techniques, and in selecting the appropriate intrusion detection techniques according to the expected attacks. We also formulate a non-zero-sum noncooperative attacker/defender game where the payoffs of players are non-strictly competitive. We show that this game achieves at least one Nash equilibrium that leads to a defense strategy for the defender.

However, WSNs have limited energy resources that hinder the dissemination of the raw data over the network to a central location. This has stimulated research into efficient data mining approaches, which can exploit the restricted computational capabilities of the sensors to model their normal behavior. Having a normal model of the network, sensors can then forward anomalous measurements to the base station. Most of the current data modeling approaches proposed for WSNs require a fixed offline training period and use batch training in contrast to the real streaming nature of data in these networks. In addition they usually work in stationary environments. In this paper we present an efficient online model construction algorithm that captures the normal behavior of the system. Our model is capable of tracking changes in the data distribution in the monitored environment. We illustrate the proposed algorithm with numerical results on both real-life and simulated data sets, which demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach compared to existing methods.","1550-4786","978-1-4577-2075-8","","10.1109/ICDM.2011.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137251","Anomaly Detection;IDCAD;Incremental Elliptical Boundary Estimation;Streaming Data Analysis","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Covariance matrix;Data models;Sensors;Training;Wireless sensor networks","data mining;security of data;wireless sensor networks","anomaly detection;batch training;data mining approaches;data modeling approaches;fixed offline training period;incremental elliptical boundary estimation;spatially dense data;wireless sensor networks","","7","","27","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several techniques are introduced to reassemble TCP packets on FPGA. However, they have some disadvantages such as inefficient memory, unscalable system, and unsupported complex TCP connections. In this paper, we propose a multi-linked-list approach and a combination of edge buffering scheme for TCP reassembly, which helps detecting cross packets intrusion signatures. Our architecture not only supports TCP connections with up to 4 concurrent holes, but also uses memory more efficiently than others.

In the last few years a number of intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been developed as network security tools. While considerable progress has been made in the areas of string matching, header processing and detecting DoS attacks at network level. In this paper we are proposing the architecture of a distributed intrusion detection system (DIDS) for use in high-speed networks. The proposed DIDS has host IDS component at each host that combines the above-mentioned functionalities. DIDS consists of central IDS component which performs sophisticated processing to detect any signs of distributed attacks on the entire network and update rules in each host system. It is essential to use hardware systems or software with hardware accelerators. The proposed DIDS is a custom hardware implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This allows the introduction of higher degree of parallelism than might be possible in software at a reasonable cost. The nature of future attacks to the Internet's infrastructure is difficult to predict, and partial reconfigurability feature of FPGA will allow the system to be adapted to a constant change allowing the system to adapt to new threats.","","1-4244-0910-1","1-4244-0910-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370616","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228344","","Computer crime;Computer networks;Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Software systems","Internet;field programmable gate arrays;security of data","DoS attacks detection;FPGA;Internet;computer networks;distributed intrusion detection systems;field programmable gate arrays;hardware accelerators;header processing;reconfigurable hardware;string matching","","2","","18","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other side is linguistic (or descriptive) fuzzy modelling, that aims at automatic rule extraction but that uses fixed human provided and linguistically labelled fuzzy sets. This work follows the linguistic fuzzy modelling approach. It uses an extended Classifier System (XCS) as mechanism to extract linguistic fuzzy rules. XCS is one of the most successful accuracy-based learning classifier systems. It provides several mechanisms for rule generalization and also allows for online training if necessary. It can be used in sequential and non-sequential tasks. Although originally applied in discrete domains it has been extended to continuous and fuzzy environments.

While the idea of performing behavior validation on-the-fly and terminating errant tasks as soon as a violation is detected is appealing, existing systems exhibit serious shortcomings in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency. To gain acceptance, a number of technical advances are needed. In this paper we focus on automated, conservative, intrusion detection techniques, i.e. techniques which do not require human intervention and do not suffer from false positives. We present a static analysis algorithm for constructing a flow- and context-sensitive model of a program that allows for efficient online validation. Context-sensitivity is essential to reduce the number of impossible control-flow paths accepted by the intrusion detection system because such paths provide opportunities for attackers to evade detection. An important consideration for on-the-fly intrusion detection is to reduce the performance overhead caused by monitoring. Compared to the existing approaches, our inlined automaton model (IAM) presents a good tradeoff between accuracy and performance. On a 32K line program, the monitoring overhead is negligible. While the space requirements of a naive IAM implementation can be quite high, compaction techniques can be employed to substantially reduce that footprint.","1081-6011","0-7695-2339-0","","10.1109/SP.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425056","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer science education;Computer security;Context modeling;Educational programs;Humans;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","automata theory;computer network management;monitoring;security of data","IAM;attacks;automated conservative intrusion detection;automaton inlining;compaction techniques;context-sensitive model;flow-sensitive model;host-based intrusion detection;inlined automaton model;monitoring overhead;on-the-fly intrusion detection;online validation;reduced footprint;static analysis algorithm","","7","1","19","","","8-11 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the current intrusion detection systems work in isolation to detect these attacks. Past research has shown that collaboration between these networks to share suspicious information is an effective way to detect intrusion. However, there are some challenges associated with the idea of collaborative detection, such as scalability and avoidance of a central point of failure. We propose a peer-to-peer approach for collaborative intrusion detection to address these challenges. Our solution proposes secure data sharing between participants from different organizations using a content based peer-to-peer publish/subscribe mechanism. The proposed scheme improves scalability, while avoiding a central point of failure. Our experimental results show improved detection latency and effective load balancing compared to a centralized architecture.","1531-2216","1-4244-0000-7","","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635451","","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer worms;Intrusion detection;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Software engineering","peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;security of data","collaborative intrusion detection system;data sharing;load balancing;peer-to-peer system;scalability improvement","","4","1","15","","","16-18 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, existing signature-based intrusion detection techniques are inadequate in providing reasonable degree of Web security. Web attacks are diverse in nature, and typical Web architecture consists of complex and hierarchically organized components. Because attack strategies often vary depending on the Web contents, it is impossible to develop fixed patterns capturing unknown attacks. Protection mechanisms such as anomaly-based intrusion detection and application-level IDS, tailored to Web services, are needed to detect Web attacks. The first step in developing Web application IDS is to analyze and categorize possible Web attacks and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we classify Web attacks by analyzing the root causes and the locations where they occur. This research is useful in developing Web IDS modules, tracking emerging trends on Web attacks, and testing Web applications against potential vulnerabilities.","","0-7695-2108-8","","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286431","","Access control;Computer crashes;Computer science;Frequency conversion;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Service oriented architecture;Web server;Web services","Internet;data privacy;file servers;message authentication;pattern classification;telecommunication security","Web IDS modules;Web application IDS;Web architecture;Web attacks;Web contents;Web security;Web server attack categorization;Web services;Web vulnerabilities;World Wide Web;anomaly-based intrusion detection;application-level IDS;attack frequency;attack strategies;complex components;fixed patterns;hierarchically organized components;protection mechanisms;root causes;signature-based intrusion detection","","2","","21","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OpenFlow protocol is an embodiment of the software-defined networking paradigm. OpenFlow network security applications can implement more complex logic processing flows than their permission or prohibition. Such applications can implement logic to provide complex quarantine procedures, or redirect malicious network flows for their special treatment. Security detection and intrusion prevention algorithms can be implemented as OpenFlow security applications, however, their implementation is often more concise and effective. In this paper we considered the algorithm of the information security management system based on soft computing, and implemented a prototype of the intrusion detection system (IDS) for software-defined network, which consisting of statistic collection and processing module and decision-making module. These modules were implemented in the form of application for the Beacon controller in Java. Evaluation of the system was carried out on one of the main problems of network security - identification of hosts engaged in malicious network scanning. For evaluation of the modules work we used mininet environment, which provides rapid prototyping for OpenFlow network. The proposed algorithm combined with the decision making based on fuzzy rules has shown better results than the security algorithms used separately. In addition the number of code lines decreased by 20-30%, as well as the opportunity to easily integrate the various external modules and libraries, thus greatly simplifies the implementation of the algorithms and decision-making system.","","978-89-968650-2-5","","10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778942","Fuzzy Logic;Information security;OpenFlow;Port scan;Software-Defined Networks","Decision making;Information security;Software algorithms;Switches;Training","decision making;fuzzy logic;protocols;security of data;software radio;telecommunication control;telecommunication network management;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","Java;OpenFlow protocol;beacon controller;data flows routing;decision making;decision-making module;fuzzy logic-based information security management;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention algorithms;logic processing flows;malicious network flows;malicious network scanning;mininet environment;network infrastructure;network security;processing module;security detection;soft computing;software-defined networks;statistic collection","","2","","7","","","16-19 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","","978-1-4244-5175-3","978-1-4244-5176-0","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","0","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to resource constraints, only one component can be probed at each time. The observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on whether the component is normal or anomalous. Components are assigned priorities. Components with higher priorities in an abnormal state should be fixed before components with lower priorities to reduce the overall damage to the network. The objective is to minimize the expected weighted sum of completion times of abnormal components subject to error probability constraints. We consider two different anomaly models: the independent model in which each component can be abnormal independent of other components, and the exclusive model in which there is one and only one abnormal component. We develop index policies under both models. Optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the simple hypotheses case, where the distribution is completely known under both hypotheses. Asymptotically (as the error probability approaches zero) optimal low-complexity algorithms are derived for the composite hypotheses case, where there is uncertainty in the distribution parameters. Simulation results then illustrate the performance of the algorithms.","","","","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6736855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736855","Anomaly detection;intrusion detection;sequential hypothesis testing","Approximation methods;Error probability;Indexes;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Testing;Uncertainty","computer network security;minimisation;probability;statistical testing","abnormal components;abnormal independent component;abnormal state;anomalous component;anomaly localization;asymptotically optimal low-complexity algorithms;component priorities;composite hypothesis;distribution parameter uncertainty;distribution parameters;error probability constraints;expected weighted completion time sum minimization;independent model;normal component;optimal index policies;overall network damage reduction;resource-constrained cyber network","","4","","24","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intrusion detection system is tasked with monitoring a system or systems in order to look for these events as indicators of potential malicious behavior. Computer intrusion detection can be provided via signatures which describe the actions associated with an attack. In a world with constantly evolving threats combined with unique new attack vectors, maintaining signatures for every individual piece of malware becomes unwieldy. This is especially true in the mobile realm, where the additional processing power and battery capacity needed to handle high numbers of signatures adversely impacts the user experience and overall platform speed. As mobile devices become increasingly computer-like, complete with similar vulnerabilities and ever-increasing connectivity, their attractiveness to attackers has increased. Efficiently detecting threats across devices on a mobile network This paper introduces the Mobile Network Defense (MND), a lightweight intrusion detection system. MND is biologically-modeled on the behavior of a population of ants, giving it many advantages over traditional security measures. Each ant in the virtual colony has the ability to detect one specic metric of the current state of a computer. In combination, the results of these simple tests can point to specic attacks, while the dynamic nature of the MND offers performance benets over the traditional static setup. This paper will demonstrate how the biologically-modeled MND offers a 34% improvement in detection time over other agent-based systems, and provides more efficient intrusion detect- - ion platform than a static model with respect to CPU utilization, making the system attractive for use across many types of mobile devices.","","978-1-4244-8448-5","978-0-7695-4236-2","10.1109/BWCCA.2010.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5633852","ACO;IDS;Security;agent;mobile;swarm intelligence","Grippers;Intrusion detection;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation","computer network security;mobile radio;optimisation;safety systems","biologically modeled intrusion detection system;computer security system;mobile network defense;potential malicious behavior indicator","","0","","16","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work has indicated that designing for reliability and designing for security share many common ideas and, more importantly, techniques that can be leveraged in product development. Security failures are one aspect of product dependability, and while security failures are qualitatively different from other reliability failures in some ways, the two classes of failures have a great deal in common. International Telecommunication Union, Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendation X.805 suggests that availability has a specific meaning for security, namely, that it “ensures that there is no denial of authorized access to network elements, stored information, information flows, services and applications due to events impacting the network.” This definition is very similar to the definition of availability that reliability engineers use in describing functionality.

This is further exasperated by the fact that most DIDS models do not consider attacks that targets the collaborative network itself. We specifically find this issue to be very critical and hence in this paper we propose a trust aware DIDS simulation model that is capable of categorizing each participating IDS expertise (i.e. speciality and competence), therefore helps collaborating organizations to consult our simulation model for choosing the right candidate for any type of intrusion.

In wireless environment these sensor nodes are defenseless or vulnerable against attacks. To solve this problem the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been used and for wireless networks, Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) has been used. But this is not sufficient to achieve maximum resiliency against attacks. Considering the issues here a new Dynamic Intrusion Detection Protocol model (DYDOG) has been designed based on data flow for High Error Rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Here the Dynamic Intrusion Detection nodes are deployed based on the proposed protocol model which will acts as forwarding node as well as Intrusion Monitoring Node with respect to the data flow through the sensor nodes. The Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes are selected from the one-hop or two hop neighbor's non-forwarding node list by using Secure Session Key Management approach without deploying separate Intrusion Monitoring Nodes. This makes the network is more flexible and dynamic against various attacks and provide maximum monitoring node's availability with better resiliency in high error rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The monitoring nodes are dynamically changed in its behavior within the session itself depends on mobility and based on proposed conditions. For an attacker it will create problem to identify and attack the Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes within the limited session. By this protocol the attacks and compromised nodes can be effectively identified at runtime in high data rate static or dynamic Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Now the research is going on On-Line Updates for local agents and global agents individually in high data rate Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), when the network has maximum mobility and maximum data rate.","","978-1-4673-0270-8","","10.1109/ICCCA.2012.6179178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179178","Dynamic Intrusion Detection Nodes;Intrusion Detection;Key management;Wireless Sensor Networks","Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Noise measurement;Routing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","error statistics;protocols;self-adjusting systems;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DYDOG;WSN;data flow;dynamic intrusion detection node;dynamic intrusion detection protocol model;global agent;high error rate wireless sensor network;intrusion monitoring node;local agent;maximum data rate;maximum mobility;network attack;one-hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;physical environment;secure session key management;self-organizing sensor node;two hop neighbor nonforwarding node list;wireless environment","","3","","11","","","22-24 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware and, even more, software platforms face difficulties in keeping up with the computationally intensive IDS tasks, and face overheads that can substantially diminish performance. In this paper we introduce a packet pre-filtering approach as a means to resolve, or at least alleviate, the increasing needs of current and future intrusion detection systems. We observe that it is very rare for a single incoming packet to fully or partially match more than a few tens of IDS rules. We capitalize on this observation selecting a small portion from each IDS rule to be matched in the pre-filtering step. The result of this partial match is a small subset of rules that are candidates for a full match. Given this pruned set of rules that can apply to a packet, a second-stage, full-match engine can sustain higher throughput. We use DefCon traces and recent Snort IDS rule-set, and show that matching the header and up to an 8-character prefix for each payload rule on each incoming packet can determine that on average 1.8 rules may apply on each packet, while the maximum number of rules to be checked across all packets is 32. Effectively, packet pre-filtering prevents matching at least 99% of the SNORT rules per packet and as a result minimizes processing and improves the scalability of the system. We also propose and evaluate the cost and performance of a reconfigurable architecture that uses multiple processing engines in order to exploit the benefits of pre-filtering.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579536","intrusion detection;packet inspection;packet pre-filtering","Costs;Engines;Face detection;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Reconfigurable architectures;Scalability;Software performance;Throughput","computer networks;filtering theory;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;telecommunication security","DefCon traces;Snort IDS rule-set;intrusion detection system;multiple processing engines;network intrusion detection;packet prefiltering;reconfigurable architecture","","1","","17","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, security objectives, electronic attack methods, and the available countermeasures for general IT systems are described. General security objectives and best practices are listed. Particularly for the TCP/IP protocol suite, a wide range of cryptography-based secure communication protocols is available. The paper describes their principles and scope of application. Next, we focus on industrial communication systems, which have a number of security-relevant characteristics distinct from the office IT systems. Confidentiality of transmitted data may not be required; however, data and user authentication, as well as access control are crucial for the mission critical and safety critical operation of the automation system. As a result, modern industrial automation systems, if they include security measures at all, emphasize various forms of access control.

They pose a serious challenge to the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which heavily rely on inspecting the network packet fields and are consequently unable to monitor encrypted sessions. IDSs can be broadly categorized into two types: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. The signature-based IDSs rely on previous attack signatures but are often ineffective against new attacks. On the other hand, anomaly-based detection systems depend on detecting the change in the protocol behavior caused by an attack. The latter can be employed to detect novel attacks, and therefore are often preferred over their signature-based counterpart. In this paper, we envision an anomaly-based IDS which can detect attacks against popular encrypted protocols, such as SSH and SSL. The proposed system creates a normal behavior profile and uses non-parametric Cusum algorithm to detect deviation from the normal profile. Upon detecting an anomaly, the proposed mechanism generates an alert, sets a delay to the protocol response, and traces back the attacker. The effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme is verified via simulations.","","1-4244-0353-7","","10.1109/ICC.2007.205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288876","","Access protocols;Authentication;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Databases;Delay;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Transport protocols","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security","anomaly-based detection systems;attack signatures;encrypted protocols;intrusion detection systems;nonparametric Cusum algorithm;packet network;secure socket layer;signature-based systems","","4","","15","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 19th International Symposium on","20081208","2008","","","1","5","Recently, Personal Networks (PNs) have been focused in supporting the userpsilas business and private activities without jeopardizing privacy and security of the users and their data. The support in business and private activities will take place through the userpsilas own personal network consisting of a core Personal Area Network (PAN) extended with clusters of remote devices which could be private, shared, or public and able to adapt to the quality of the network accessed. The extended PAN with its cluster communication with another PN forms a Federation of Personal Networks (PN-F). PN-F is a secure cooperation between different PNs, making services and resources available for the purpose of achieving a common goal, increasing the security requirements and challenges. The communication in this scenario can happen in various places (home, work, public places), involving various types of network infrastructure, between various types of hardware, and exchanging any kind of service. Context aware security manager (CASM) has been proposed to solve the PN security issue, putting all the security decision in the gateway between PAN and cluster or PN and another PN. CASM relies on providing security policy based on the context being given by user. So far, algorithm regarding how to input the context has not yet been defined. Furthermore, how CASM react upon the context in deciding what security action should be performed has also not yet been elaborated. This paper will analyze the impact of context to security. The paper will work as a continuation of CASM by elaborating further a proposed algorithm on defining the context parameters, quantifying context parameter so that CASM can make decision upon it, and optimizing the matrix of context information.","","978-1-4244-2643-0","978-1-4244-2644-7","10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4699962","Ad Hoc Network;Communication System Security;Personal Communication Network;Protocols","Ad hoc networks;Clustering algorithms;Communication system security;Context awareness;Data security;Hardware;Information security;Personal area networks;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","internetworking;personal area networks;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","business activity;context aware security manager;context information matrix;decision making;gateway;personal area network security;private activity;remote device","","0","","9","","","15-18 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We resolve two critical issues when designing scalable parallelism specifically for pattern matching modules: 1) how to enable fine-grained parallelism in pursuit of effective load balancing and desirable speedup simultaneously; and 2) how to reconcile the tension between parallel processing speedup and prohibitive TCAM power consumption. To this end, we first propose the novel concept of Negative Pattern Matching to partition flows, by which the number of TCAM lookups can be significantly reduced, and the resulting (fine-grained) flow segments can be inspected in parallel without incurring false negatives. Then we propose the notion of Exclusive Pattern Matching to divide the entire pattern set into multiple subsets which can later be matched against selectively and independently without affecting the correctness. We show that Exclusive Pattern Matching enables the adoption of smaller and faster TCAM blocks and improves both the pattern matching speed and scalability. Finally, our theoretical and experimental results validate that the above two concepts are inherently complementary, enabling our integrated scheme to provide performance gain in any scenario (with either clean or dirty traffic).","0743-166X","978-1-4244-5836-3","","10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5462152","","Communications Society;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Energy consumption;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Scalability;USA Councils","content-addressable storage;parallel processing;pattern matching;security of data","NIDS;TCAM lookups;TCAM-based pattern matching;exclusive pattern matching;load balancing;negative pattern matching;network intrusion detection systems;parallel processing speedup;ternary content addressable memories","","1","","12","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If compromised, these hosts may inject bogus data into the intrusion detection system to hide their activities or falsely accuse well-behaved nodes. Approaches to Byzantine fault tolerance involving voting are potentially applicable, but must address the fact that only nodes in particular topological locations at particular times are qualified to vote on whether an attack occurred. We examine these issues in the context of a prototype distributed detector for self-contained, in-band wormholes in OLSR networks. We propose an opportunistic voting algorithm and present test results from a 48-node testbed in which colluding attackers generate corroborating false accusations against pairs of innocent nodes. The results indicate that opportunistic voting can instantaneously suppress false accusations when the network topology and routes chosen by OLSR provide a sufficient number of nearby honest observers to outvote the attackers.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412993","","Computer networks;Delay;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Voting","ad hoc networks;computer networks;mobile radio;security of data","Byzantine fault tolerance;MANET;cooperative intrusion detection techniques;countering false accusations;inband wormholes detection;intrusion detection system;network intrusion sensors;network topology;opportunistic voting algorithm","","6","","25","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reduction in video hardware cost has made it more feasible for large scale camera deployment. However, the increased scale of camera deployment creates difficulties for humans to track people through the monitored space and to recognize important events as they happen in timely manner without human intervention. In this paper we share the implementation of the multi node video analytics specifically focusing on intrusion detection. The system uses general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to offload the video analytics processing. The architecture of the GPGPU requires the algorithm to be coded in Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which involves algorithm parallelization adopting both micro and macro parallelization to ensure the performance gain in processing speed on per frame basis by 7 times. In addition, we have managed to deploy 35 camera streams on single GPU card running at 20 frames per second which results in scalability factor of 1.75 times vs. a server class PC. Indeed, we have also managed to maintain the video analytics accuracy at 100% for given test dataset, in this implementation of the system.","","978-1-4799-2208-6","","10.1109/SPC.2013.6735111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735111","CUDA;GPGPU;parallelization;streaming;video analytics;video surveillance system","Accuracy;Cameras;Central Processing Unit;Conferences;Graphics processing units;Process control;Streaming media","graphics processing units;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;security of data;video cameras;video streaming;video surveillance","CUDA;GPGPU;camera surveillance area;compute unified device architecture;general purpose graphical processing unit;intrusion detection system;large scale camera deployment;macroparallelization;microparallelization;multinode video analytics processing;people tracking;real-time multinode streaming;surveillance activity;video hardware cost reduction;video surveillance system","","0","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It identifies the challenges in deploying Wireless Mesh networks (WMNs) and focus on secure routing as one of the key challenges in deploying WMNs. In order to implement a secure routing system, various Artificial Immune System (AIS) models were analysed. These models have been used in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and computer security in the literature. In this paper, the authors propose to use Danger models to secure routing in WMNs. The first step in secure routing process is to identify and classify the network dangers and take necessary actions to overcome those dangers. For the classification task, we apply Self-organizing Maps (SOMs) as the classifier to classify the danger levels in WMNs. These identified danger conditions are further deployed as the warning signals for the design of secure routing protocol. The experimental results validate the proposal of applying the Danger Theory (DT) into security area and good performance is also reported by the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier.","","978-1-4244-1557-1","978-1-4244-1558-8","10.1109/ATNAC.2007.4665308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4665308","Antibody;Antigen;HumanImmune System (HIS);Self-organizing Maps (SOMs)","Artificial immune systems;Artificial neural networks;Communication system security;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Real time systems;Routing;Self organizing feature maps;Wireless mesh networks","artificial intelligence;neural nets;radio networks;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing","artificial neural network classifier;computer security;danger theory;intrusion detection system;routing security;self-organized classification;self-organizing maps;wireless mesh networks security","","0","","13","","","2-5 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
