This is due to the inherent benefits of virtualization including fault tolerance through checkpoint/restart (C/R) mechanisms. Because clouds are the abstraction of large data enters and large data enters have a higher potential for failure, it is imperative that a C/R mechanism for such an environment provide minimal latency as well as a small checkpoint file size. Recently, there has been much research into C/R with respect to virtual machines (VM) providing excellent solutions to reduce either checkpoint latency or checkpoint file size. However, these approaches do not provide both. This paper presents a method of check pointing VMs by utilizing virtual machine introspection (VMI). Through the usage of VMI, we are able to determine which pages of memory within the guest are used or free and are better able to reduce the amount of pages written to disk during a checkpoint. We have validated this work by using various benchmarks to measure the latency along with the checkpoint size. With respect to checkpoint file size, our approach results in file sizes within 24% or less of the actual used memory within the guest. Additionally, the checkpoint latency of our approach is up to 52% faster than KVM's default method.","","","","10.1109/CCGrid.2014.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846477","Checkpointing;Cloud;Virtualization","Checkpointing;Kernel;Linux;Memory management;Monitoring;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","checkpointing;cloud computing;fault tolerance;virtual machines;virtualisation","C/R mechanisms;VMI;checkpoint/restart mechanisms;cloud computing environments;fault tolerance;system-level virtualization;virtual machine introspection","","0","","30","","","26-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Honeypot is one of effective mechanism to detect and analyze intruders activities. Since packets sent to honeypots are almost always malicious, thus false alerts, that is serious problems in the normal intrusion detection system, are minimized. However, there are two important disadvantages in honeypot. First, the scope of a honeypot is limited to the address it attached. Second, there are potential risk that honeypot is compromised by a smart intruder. In this paper, we propose a centralized surveillance of unused address space. The whole unused addresses in the organization are virtually watched by a small number of the honeypots installed in a special network under the control. By the aggregation of honeypots, honeypots may be supervised well, and the risk of compromise may be reduced. The surveillance system can be established without making alternation in existing network equipments. It selects the address under surveillance autonomously. It is able to adapt to addition and deletion of networks and hosts without any administration.","","0-7695-2492-3","","10.1109/PRDC.2005.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607533","","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Electronic mail;IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Network topology;Surveillance;Switches","Internet;surveillance;telecommunication security","Internet security;centralized surveillance;honeypot;unused address space surveillance;virtual networks","","0","1","10","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we proposed a change-point detection method to prevent denial-of-service attacks on VoIP systems based on session initiation protocol (SIP) protocol behavior analysis. We develop efficient adaptive sequential change-point method to detect attacks which lead to changes in network traffic. The change-point detection method employs a statistical analysis of data to detect very subtle traffic changes which from SIP protocol behavior.

Often, their operation can be at risk by adversaries that launch attacks against the WSN with the aim of compromising the reliability and availability of the network and the respective application. The outcome of an attack highly depends on the experience of the adversary and his capabilities in terms of programming skills, security knowledge and resources. From the network perspective, the challenge is to reliably recover to a normal operation as soon as the adversary is been detected and allow for packet delivery to destination. The challenge is even greater in the presence of adversaries that adapt their intrusion strategy to break the deployed recovery countermeasures and continue affecting the network. Proposed recovery countermeasures typically assume the use of omni-directional antennas, which cannot take advantage of antenna directivity in order to manipulate communication paths between WSN nodes for the purpose of (physically) bypassing an adversary. This paper presents an intrusion recovery protocol in WSNs that uses directional antennas to create controlled communication paths, thus routing, and enhancing the reliability, self-healingness and resilience of the network. The proposed protocol is implemented within the AODV context and evaluated using ns-2. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol to deliver packets to the destination in the presence of multiple persistent adversaries that deploy different types of simple to extended attacks.","","978-1-4577-0025-5","","10.1109/CTS.2011.5898964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898964","WSN security;directional antennas;recovery;secure routing","Computer crime;Directional antennas;Protocols;Routing;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","computer network reliability;computer network security;directive antennas;safety-critical software;wireless sensor networks","decision-making;directional antennas;mission-critical areas;network availability;network reliability;ns-2;persistent adversaries;security;wireless sensor networks","","2","","21","","","8-11 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The rationale for this comes from the need to have an overall view of security events or storms that are occurring on a network while providing information in reference to severity and a propagation pattern. Thus, it can potentially provide an early warning so that events or storms can be proactively mitigated. In addition, it can help in making business decisions by determining or understanding the relationship between the computing devices and the business/information technology services they make up.","","978-1-4799-0219-4","","10.1109/CyberSecurity.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542531","Cyber-security;event correlation;information visualization;levels of abstraction;security event","","business data processing;computer network security;decision making;time series","business decision making;cyber-security event;cyber-security monitoring system;cyber-security storm;early warning;environmental states;information technology services;network security events;predictive forecast;propagation pattern;security events;time series event data correlation;visual representation","","0","","20","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tampering with the kernel data is an attractive venue for rootkit writers since malicious modifications in the kernel are harder to identify compared to their user-level counterparts. So far however, the pattern followed for tampering is limited to hiding malicious objects in user-space. This involves manipulating a subset of kernel data structures that are related to intercepting user requests or affecting the user's view of the system. Hence, defense techniques are built around detecting such hiding behavior. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a new class of stealthy attacks that only exist in kernel space and do not employ any hiding techniques traditionally used by rootkits. These attacks are stealthy because the damage done to the system is not apparent to the user or intrusion detection systems installed on the system and are symbolic of a more systemic problem present throughout the kernel. Our goal in building these attack prototypes was to show that such attacks are not only realistic, but worse; they cannot be detected by the current generation of kernel integrity monitors, without prior knowledge of the attack signature.","1081-6011","0-7695-2848-1","","10.1109/SP.2007.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223229","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Control systems;Data structures;Detectors;File systems;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Monitoring;Prototypes","data integrity;data structures;invasive software;operating system kernels","attack signature;kernel code;kernel data structures;malicious modifications;stealthy attacks;systemic threats","","15","","18","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, it spends the majority of CPU time in packet classification to search for rules that match each packet. A common approach is to build a graph such as rule trees or finite automata for a given rule set, and traverse it using a packet as an input string. Because of the increasing number of security threats and vulnerabilities, the number of rules often exceeds thousands requiring more than hundreds of megabytes of memory. Exploring such a huge graph becomes a major bottleneck in high-speed networks since each packet incurs many memory accesses with little locality. In this paper, we propose rule hashing for fast packet classification in intrusion detection systems. The rule hashing, combined with hierarchical rule trees, saves memory and reduce the number of memory accesses by allowing the whole working set to be accommodated in a cache in most of the time, and thus improves response times in finding matching rules. We implement our algorithm in Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. Experimental results show that our implementation is faster than original Snort to deal with the same real packet traces while consuming an order of magnitude less memory.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-2389-7","978-1-4244-2390-3","10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674280","","Automata;Databases;Engines;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Open source software;Pattern matching;Payloads;Protocols;Tree graphs","cryptography;finite automata;trees (mathematics)","CPU time;Snort;finite automata;graph;hierarchical rule trees;open-source intrusion detection system;packet classification;rule hashing;rule-based intrusion detection system;security threats","","2","","13","","","3-7 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the information extracted from network flows a model of normal user behavior is discovered with the help of several clustering techniques. This model is then used to detect anomalies within recent time intervals. Since this approach is based on normal user behavior, it can potentially detect zero-day intrusions. Moreover, such a flow-based intrusion detection approach can be used in high speeds since it is based on information in packet headers, and, therefore, has to handle a considerably lesser amount of data. The proposed framework is tested on the data obtained with the help of a realistic cyber environment (RGCE) that enables one to construct real attack vectors.

Some stages of the attack may appear innocent if checked separately. Furthermore, the intervals between these separate attack stages can be on the order of hours, days, or even months. These characteristics of multi-stage attacks make the detection task challenging for most existing IDSs that are stateless in that they perform intrusion detection by independently checking individual packets, connections or sessions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, active event correlation (AEC), which collects and correlates suspicious network events inside a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). AEC infers the possibility of attacks in the context of security policies and blocks attacks before they are completed. We have implemented AEC on top of the Bro NIDS (Paxson, 1999). Experiments indicate that AEC can effectively recognize and correlate individual stages of multi-stage attacks, stop incomplete attack stages, and give network administrators meaningful and concise alerts","","0-7695-2564-4","","10.1109/IWIA.2006.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1609998","","Aggregates;Bridges;Computer crime;Computer science;Conferences;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Security;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;security of data;telecommunication security","Bro NIDS;active event correlation;computer attacks;multistage attack detection;network intrusion detection system;security policies","","2","","20","","","13-14 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the security of IMS networks has not been fully examined. This paper presents a novel DoS attack against IMS. By congesting the presence service, a core service of IMS, a malicious attack can cause chained automatic reaction of the system, thus blocking all the services of IMS. Because of the low-volume nature of this attack, an attacker only needs to control several clients to paralyze an IMS network supporting one million users. To address this DoS attack, we propose an online early defense mechanism, which aims to first detect the attack, then identify the malicious clients, and finally block them. We formulate this problem as a change-point detection problem, and solve it based on the non-parametric GRSh test. Through trace-driven experiments, we demonstrate that our defense mechanism can throttle this DoS attack within a short defense time window while generating few false alarms.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062173","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer science;Information analysis;Maintenance engineering;Protocols;Resonance light scattering;Signal generators;Subscriptions;Telecommunication traffic","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;security of data","3G networks;IMS networks;IP multimedia subsystem;chain reaction DoS attack;chained automatic reaction;change-point detection;defense time window;malicious attack;malicious clients;multimedia services;non-parametric GRSh test;online early defense mechanism","","7","","30","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In MANET, wide area communication on wireless networks can be realized because a node relays other node's packets by adopting a multi-hop routing protocol. Security is an indispensable issue in MANET because an unknown node may join the network easily. However, the demand for the level of authentication and its response time is different depending on the environment and applications. Thus, we focus on real-time control of the security mechanism for MANET. In this paper, we have established multi-hop communication environment and introduced methods to control secure connections by applying IPsec as an encryption scheme, on top of the general-purpose operating systems with enabled preemption for interruption. Under such conditions, we have measured response time of CPU with or without load of other applications.

To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware. We also evaluate them in terms of performance and the resources that they require.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903487","Xen;cloud computing;forensics;introspection;intrusion detection;monitoring;security;virtual machine;virtualization","Forensics;Kernel;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Virtual machining","cloud computing;digital forensics;invasive software;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","FVM;Mini-OS virtualised operating system;Xen virtualisation platform;cloud defence;forensic virtual machines;guest virtual machines;image vulnerability;malicious activities;malicious behaviour discovery;malware","","2","","29","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose VMDriver, a general and fine-grained approach for virtualization monitoring. The novel design of VMDriver is the separation of event interception point in VMM level and rich guest OS semantic reconstructions in management domain. With this design, variant monitoring drivers in management domain can mask the differences of guest OSes. We implement VMDriver on Xen and our experimental study shows that it introduces very small performance overhead.

"A Hybrid TCAM + SRAM Scheme for Multi-match Packet Classification","Ransheng Shen; Xianfeng Li; Hui Li","Sch. of Comput. & Inf.

Traditional packet classification only reports a single matched rule with the highest priority in case of multiple matched ones. With the emergence of new applications such as network intrusion detection system (NDIS), all matched rules need to be reported. This multi-match problem is more challenging and is getting higher attention in recent years. Because of the stringent time budget on classification, architectural solutions using Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) attract more attention than software solutions for backbone network routers. However, despite its advantage on search speed, TCAM is much more expensive than SRAM, and is notorious for its extraordinarily high power consumption. These problems limit the application and scalability of TCAM solutions. This paper presents a novel tree-based hybrid TCAM+SRAM solution for the purposes of both TCAM space reduction and power saving. The experiments show that the proposed solution achieves significantly more savings on both memory space and power consumption on packet matching than existing solutions.","","978-0-7695-4879-1","","10.1109/PDCAT.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589360","SRAM;TCAM;multi-match;packet classification","Educational institutions;Indexes;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand;Protocols;Random access memory","SRAM chips;content-addressable storage;tree data structures","NDIS;TCAM memory space reduction;TCAM power saving;architectural solutions;multimatch packet classification;network intrusion detection system;network packets;network routers;packet header;power consumption;search speed;ternary content-addressable memory;tree-based hybrid TCAM-plus-SRAM solution","","1","","11","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In DIRNR, the concepts and formal definitions of self, nonself, antibody, antigen and immune detector in network risk evaluation domain are given. Then, depending on a series of immune responses to antigen, such as self evolution, self tolerance and immune detector lifecycle, the mathematical models for describing the change of network risk are established. Building upon the above models, a real-time network risk calculation model based on antibody density is presented. By using DIRNR, the types and intensity of network attacks can be calculated in real-time. In DIRNR, the concept of the antibody density in a biological immune system has been abstracted and extended, and a new method based on antibody density for network risk evaluation has been presented.

In traditional ICT systems, the end devices are the powerful systems which have high computation power and memory capacity to perform the intense computations to avoid cyber security threats, whereas most of the end devices in SG lack these capabilities. Incorporating the security in the early stages of SG development through systems security requirements engineering can reduce the potential cyber security threats.

Most of the modern intrusion detection systems lack the ability to process massive data streams to achieve anomaly detection. Instead of Intrusion detection, Intrusion prevention system can be used for both servers and end-hosts to handle the dual challenges of accuracy and performance which the former lacks. Intrusion prevention can be done by processing the data stream on fly. It is a difficult issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. Many applications rely directly or indirectly on finding the frequent items, and implementations are in use in large scale industrial systems. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. Our method is employed to prevent the system with high efficiency and low use of system resources.","","978-1-4673-2981-1","","10.1109/CICN.2012.167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6375255","Data Stream;Frequent Pattern Mining;Intrusion Prevention","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Data mining;Data models;Intrusion detection;Servers","data mining;security of data","anomaly intrusion prevention;intrusion detection;massive data streams;network security architecture;online frequent item set mining;time-sensitive sliding window","","0","","12","","","3-5 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current cloud services are getting more decoupled with each layer in the cloud stack generating different logs for network, applications, database, and programming interfaces on different machines. At any point in time, cloud providers, users, or application developers arguably require to understand the status of different components, monitor business processes, and analyse machine logs in real time. However, there are no specialised search engines for the systematic analysis of logs by different cloud providers. Hence, this paper presents Simha, an agent-based document search service for cloud platforms. It implements a proof of concept system to analyse user documents, logs, and folders in real time from different virtual machines. Based on an Elastic search server, our overall search process has been extended to distributively search data stored into cloud.

However, since the nodes in a MANET are generally resource limited, some nodes could refuse service to other nodes to conserve their resources, thereby exhibiting selfish behavior. Also, since a MANET is often deployed in uncontrolled environments, some nodes could be compromised by an adversary and directed to act maliciously. A trust management framework in a MANETis useful to infer if nodes behave in a selfish or malicious manner, so that appropriate action could be taken, in order to maximize network performance. In this paper, we propose a scalable trust management scheme to partition and store an information network of trust metadata of nodes in a MANET. The simplicity of our scheme for trust metadata propagation and retrieval and its robustness to node failures, membership changes and mobility, make it a promising choice for trust management in a MANET.

The proposed approach aims at reducing the operation and maintenance cost of the system by using a messaging network enhanced with the capability to store, inspect and analyze selected portions of the exchanged messages under the strict control of security and privacy. Complexity makes any information system vulnerable to design flaws, operation error, and security problems. The proposed approach facilitates analyzing these problems associated with complex SOA systems through the message-store analysis. We consider that the application of computer forensics to the message store in SOA helps the system administrator to identify and fix various problems.

In order to meet the real-time performance requirements imposed on these security applications, developing a high-speed parallelization technique is essential for the AC algorithm. In this paper, we present a new memory efficient parallelization technique which efficiently places and caches the input text data and the reference data in the on-chip shared memories and texture caches of the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). Furthermore, the new approach efficiently schedules memory accesses in order to minimize the overhead in loading data to the on-chip shared memories.

Classification maps data into predefined groups or classes. It is often referred to as supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data. In many data mining applications that address classification problems, feature and model selection are considered as key tasks. That is, appropriate input features of the classifier must be selected from a given set of possible features and structure parameters of the classifier must be adapted with respect to these features and a given data set. This paper describes feature selection and model selection simultaneously for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. In order to reduce the optimization effort, various techniques are integrated that accelerate and improve the classifier significantly: hybrid k-NN, comparative cross validation. The feasibility and the benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by means of data mining problem: intrusion detection in computer networks. It is shown that, compared to earlier k-NN technique, the run time is reduced by up to 0.01 % and 0.06 % while error rates are lowered by up to 0.002 % and 0.03 % for normal and abnormal behaviour respectively. The algorithm is independent of specific applications so that many ideas and solutions can be transferred to other classifier paradigms.","","978-1-4244-4786-2","978-1-4244-4787-9","10.1109/ICADVC.2009.5377998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5377998","","Application software;Control systems;Energy consumption;Humanoid robots;Hydraulic actuators;Induction motors;Intrusion detection;Legged locomotion;Robot control;Testing","computer network security;data mining;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","computer networks;data mining;databases process;feature selection;information extraction;intrusion detection;k-nearest neighbor classifier;knowledge discovery;map data classification;supervised learning","","0","","27","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With virtualization platform administrators tasked with preventing attacks in order to provide uninterrupted service, existing intrusion detection technologies are continuously challenged. Consequently, this paper proposes a Centralized Administration and Dynamic Monitoring framework (CADM) based on virtualization for network intrusion detection. CADM is able to centrally administrate, and monitor network behavior in the virtual computing environment by automatically deploying and updating intrusion detection processes and rules. In the aspect of monitoring capability, CADM allows the monitoring locations in intrusion detection to be automatically adjusted in real time, thus adapting to the dynamic changes (such as migration) of virtual machines (VMs). Moreover, the monitoring processes involved in intrusion detection could also be automatically updated by dynamically updating security strategies. In the aspect of monitoring granularity, CADM is able to monitor network interfaces of each virtual machine (VM) for fine-grained network intrusion detection and network traffic acquisition. Our experimental results demonstrate that more convenient and efficient monitoring and administrating capabilities are available with CADM for virtualization platform administrators.","","978-1-4799-2418-9","","10.1109/PDCAT.2013.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6904241","Centralized Management;Dynamic Update;Network Intrusion Detection;Virtualization Security Monitoring","Hardware;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Servers;Virtualization","security of data;virtual machines;virtualisation","CADM;VM;centralized administration;dynamic monitoring framework;fine-grained network intrusion detection;intrusion detection technologies;monitoring granularity;network traffic acquisition;virtual computing environment;virtual machines;virtual network structure;virtualization platform administrators;virtualization technology","","0","","17","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to encourage selfish nodes to assume the leadership role, some form of incentive mechanism is required. We present an incentive-based leader selection mechanism in which incentives are incorporated in the form of credit transfer to the leader, which motivates nodes to compete with each other for assuming the leadership role. The competition among nodes is modeled as a series of one-on-one incomplete information, alternating offers bargaining games. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm in order to reduce the communication overhead imposed on the network for selecting a new leader, in case the current leader is disconnected from the network due to reasons such as mobility and battery depletion. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism not only increases the overall lifetime of a network, but also decreases the amount of imposed communication overhead on the network in comparison with the traditional leader selection algorithms.","2156-9711","","","10.1109/WD.2013.6686474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686474","Bargaining game;Incentive mechanism;Leader selection;MANETs;Price-based systems;Self-organizing networks","Ad hoc networks;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Lead;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Protocols","game theory;mobile ad hoc networks","MANETs;bargaining games;battery depletion;communication overhead;incentive-based leader selection mechanism;mobile ad-hoc networks;selfish nodes","","0","","14","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We introduce the concept of a Wireless Control Network (WCN) where the entire network itself acts as the controller. Specifically, at each time-step, each node updates its internal state to be a linear combination of the states of the nodes in its neighborhood. We show that this causes the entire network to behave as a linear dynamical system, with sparsity constraints imposed by the network topology. We then provide a numerical design procedure to determine the appropriate linear combinations to be applied by each node so that the transmissions of the nodes closest to the actuators will stabilize the plant. We also show how our design procedure can be modified to maintain mean square stability under packet drops in the network.","0743-1546","978-1-4244-7745-6","","10.1109/CDC.2010.5717159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5717159","","Actuators;Delay;Linear matrix inequalities;Network topology;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","control system synthesis;linear systems;network topology;networked control systems;radio networks;stability","linear dynamical system;mean square stability;network topology;networked control schemes;wireless control network;wireless nodes","","10","","18","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed tool will utilize Snort rules in the model creation process where a Snort rule is transformed into XML and MSC models. Besides Snort rules, the proposed tool is able to utilize network traffic traces stored in a packet capture format (Pcap). These traces may contain diverse set of different network activities that are relevant in gaining unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. Using these traces the proposed tool can create XML and MSC models that depict the malicious activities.

The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then use our vulnerability metric to evaluate a data structure which is commonly used in network mechanisms-the Hash table data structure. We show that Closed Hash is much more vulnerable to DDoS attacks than Open Hash, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent by traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queuing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems. Furthermore, we apply it to the practical case of a hash table whose requests are controlled by a queue, showing that even after the attack has ended, the regular users still suffer from performance degradation or even a total denial of service.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158635","Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Computer crime;DDoS;Data structures;Degradation;Measurement;Servers;hash;malicious;metric;queue;vulnerability","Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Computer crime;Data structures;Degradation;Measurement;Servers","Internet;computer network security;cryptography","DDoS attacks;Distributed Denial of Service attacks;Internet;closed hash;computer-network designs;hash table data structure;malicious users;network mechanism vulnerability;open hash;queuing mechanisms;vulnerability metric","","2","","26","","2012-02-27","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key section of code injection attack is a small piece of code, called shellcode, which performs unauthorized operations when it is injected into software as part of valid data. On Windows CE, input data are often encoded using Unicode before being processed. In such cases, shellcode should be built in a way that bypasses such encoding; that is, it should be Unicode-proof. Unicode-proof shellcode also has great advantage of evading instruction detection system. However, it is quite difficult to build Unicode-proof shellcode for the ARM architecture, on which most embedded devices are developed, because the subset of instructions that can be used to write Unicode-proof shellcode is very limited. Moreover, the instruction cache in the ARM processor restricts the application of self-modifying code, which is frequently used in shellcode writing. This novel research proposes an approach to building ARM Unicode-proof shellcode on Windows CE under these constraints. The approach applies to all versions of ARM processors and Windows CE, including systems evolved from Windows CE, such as Windows Mobile and Windows Phone. The shellcode is tested on three currently available devices.","","978-1-61284-485-5","","10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6013556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6013556","Unicode-proof;Windows CE;code injection","Architecture;Buildings;Computer architecture;Mobile communication;Registers;Security;Writing","invasive software;microprocessor chips;mobile handsets;operating systems (computers)","ARM architecture;ARM processor;Unicode-proof code injection attack;Unicode-proof shellcode;Windows CE;Windows Mobile;Windows Phone;embedded devices;instruction cache;instruction detection system;intrusion detection system;malware;mobile network;self-modifying code;shellcode writing;unauthorized operations","","1","","10","","","27-29 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach is based on a simple yet powerful analogy from the innate part of the human immune system, the Toll-Like Receptors. We argue that such receptors incorporated as part of an anomaly detector enhance the detector's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous behaviour. In addition we propose that Toll-Like Receptors enable the classification of detected anomalies based on the types of attacks that perpetrate the anomalous behaviour. Classification of such type is either missing in existing literature or is not fit for the purpose of reducing the burden of an administrator of an intrusion detection system.

Multiple regular expressions matching is one of the most important performance bottlenecks in those systems. This paper proposes a new hardware-based multiple regular-expressions matching architecture, called MRM, for network intrusion detection system. It shows that traditional algorithm, such as AC, has to face the serious spatial explosion problem when simultaneously detecting a large number of regular expressions because of constrained repetitions. MRM utilizes hardware RAM modules to share matching signals and exploits hardware register counting to implement constrained repetitions. This paper also proposes a software compiler to construct the hardware architecture and generate information in MRM's RAMs for the given regular expressions. Experiments in actual snort and bro regular expression sets show that MRM can achieve the high throughput of 2.1 Gbps and 2.8 Gbps on Virtex2 and Virtex4 devices respectively.","","978-1-4244-2373-6","978-1-4244-2374-3","10.1109/CHINACOM.2008.4685118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685118","intrusion detection;pattern matching;regular expression matching","Automata;Computer architecture;Doped fiber amplifiers;Face detection;Hardware;Information security;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads","packet radio networks;pattern matching;random-access storage;safety systems;security of data;telecommunication security","RAM modules;bit rate 2.1 Gbit/s;bit rate 2.8 Gbit/s;multiple regular-expressions matching;network intrusion detection system;network security;regular expressions","","0","","11","","","25-27 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CEP is capable of handling large variety of data with high computational velocity and delivers better solution compared to other existing techniques. However, handling large volume data streams still poses challenge in CEP systems. Hence, a middleware is required to manage huge streams of data on scalable distributed environment.

In this paper, we survey the development of existing biometric authentication techniques on mobile phones, particularly on touch-enabled devices, with reference to 11 biometric approaches (five physiological and six behavioral). We present a taxonomy of existing efforts regarding biometric authentication on mobile phones and analyze their feasibility of deployment on touch-enabled mobile phones. In addition, we systematically characterize a generic biometric authentication system with eight potential attack points and survey practical attacks and potential countermeasures on mobile phones. Moreover, we propose a framework for establishing a reliable authentication mechanism through implementing a multimodal biometric user authentication in an appropriate way. Experimental results are presented to validate this framework using touch dynamics, and the results show that multimodal biometrics can be deployed on touch-enabled phones to significantly reduce the false rates of a single biometric system. Finally, we identify challenges and open problems in this area and suggest that touch dynamics will become a mainstream aspect in designing future user authentication on mobile phones.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7000543","Behavioral Biometrics;Mobile Phones;Multimodal Biometrics;Physiological Biometrics;Touch Dynamics;User Authentication;User authentication;behavioral biometrics;mobile phones;multimodal biometrics;physiological biometrics;touch dynamics","Authentication;Face;Face recognition;Iris recognition;Mobile handsets;Physiology;Retina","biometrics (access control);mobile computing","multimodal biometric user authentication techniques;potential attack points;survey practical attacks;touch-enabled mobile phones","","0","","243","","2014-12-31","thirdquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our approach is based on the principle of an intelligent loss. We propose a classification model based on the principle that a connection is either malicious or not. In the first case, the connection must be handled by the IDS; otherwise we can ignore it. This method reduces significantly the network flow sent to the IDS with a tolerance of an error threshold.

Although several schemes have been proposed recently to address the multimatch packet classification problem, most of them require either huge memory or expensive ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) to store the intermediate data structure, or they suffer from steep performance degradation under certain types of classifiers. In this paper, we decompose the operation of multimatch packet classification from the complicated multidimensional search to several single-dimensional searches, and present an asynchronous pipeline architecture based on a signature tree structure to combine the intermediate results returned from single-dimensional searches. By spreading edges of the signature tree across multiple hash tables at different stages, the pipeline can achieve a high throughput via the interstage parallel access to hash tables. To exploit further intrastage parallelism, two edge-grouping algorithms are designed to evenly divide the edges associated with each stage into multiple work-conserving hash tables. To avoid collisions involved in hash table lookup, a hybrid perfect hash table construction scheme is proposed. Extensive simulation using realistic classifiers and traffic traces shows that the proposed pipeline architecture outperforms HyperCuts and B2PC schemes in classification speed by at least one order of magnitude, while having a similar storage requirement. Particularly, with different types of classifiers of 4K rules, the proposed pipeline architecture is able to achieve a throughput between 26.8 and 93.1 Gb/s using perfect hash tables.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2013.2270441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565409","Hash table;packet classification;signature tree;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Encoding;IEEE transactions;Memory management;Pipelines;Power demand;Search engines;Throughput","content-addressable storage;cryptography;security of data;signal classification;table lookup;tree data structures","TCAM;asynchronous pipeline architecture;bit rate 26.8 Gbit/s to 93.1 Gbit/s;complicated multidimensional search;distributed hash tables;edge-grouping;hash table lookup;high-throughput multimatch;hybrid perfect hash table construction;intermediate data structure;interstage parallel access;memory-efficient multimatch;multimatch packet classification problem;network intrusion detection;packet-level accounting;pipelined hash tables;signature tree structure;single-dimensional searches;steep performance degradation;ternary content addressable memory;throughput via;traffic traces","","0","","37","","2013-07-22","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing.

This paper examines a splitter architecture that incorporates two methods for improving system performance: the first is the use of early filtering where a portion of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32%, giving a 8% increase in sensor performance, while locality buffers improve sensor performance by about 10%. Combined together, the two methods result in an overall improvement of 20% while the performance of the slowest sensor is improved by 14%.","1526-7539","0-7695-2039-1","","10.1109/MASCOT.2003.1240665","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240665","","Computational Intelligence Society;Computer architecture;Computer science;Filtering;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Load management;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","authorisation;resource allocation;sensors;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","active traffic splitter architecture;early filtering method;load balancing traffic splitter;locality buffering;memory access improvement;multiple sensor;packet reordering;parallel coupling;scaling network intrusion detection;sensor performance improvement;system performance improvement","","6","","5","","","12-15 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem of anomaly detection can be addressed as the problem of distinguishing self patterns from non-self patterns. The self patterns could be any variety of characteristics of a system or its users. Detectors of an AIS recognize non-self patterns and invoke an alarm. In this work, an AIS was used to monitor simulated TCP/IP traffic on a simulated broadcast local area network. Detectors, in the form of interval constraints, were used to develop a simple and effective AIS.","","1-889335-18-5","","10.1109/WAC.2002.1049551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1049551","","Artificial immune systems;Computer networks;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern recognition;Protection;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","authorisation;computer networks;computer viruses","TCP/IP traffic;abnormality detection;artificial immune system;computer network;constraint-based detector;illegal intrusion;interval constraints;nonself pattern;self pattern","","4","","5","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the speed of data packet capture and analysis doesn't match the network application, which causes a general problem in IDS and the ratio of data packet lost is quite high. Various intrusion detection technologies are widely used to solve this problem. In those technologies, the pattern matching based on knowledge is the most popular technology. It compares a series of attack characteristic with user's activity that has already been discovered, and then intrusion will be detected. Its match speed affects the rate of drop packet, and false alarm, the accuracy and the real-time performance of system in a direct way. It plays an essential role in the efficiency of intrusion detection system. As network speed and capacity is growing rapid, it is necessary to improve the algorithm of pattern matching to follow the currency. This article describes a quite mature algorithm in the intrusion detection system-BM algorithm, based on which some improvements have been proposed.","","978-1-4577-0271-6","978-0-7695-4413-7","10.1109/DMDCM.2011.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959760","BM Algorithm;Enhanced;Intrusion Detection;Pattern Matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Safety","search problems;security of data;string matching","BM algorithm;Boyer-Moore algorithm;IDS system;data packet analysis;data packet capture;data packet lost;false alarm;intrusion detection system;pattern matching","","0","","21","","","15-16 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A novel adaptive intrusion detection approach based on comparison of neural networks and idiotypic networks","Linhui Zhao; Xin Fang; Yaping Dai","Sch. of Mechatron., Beijing Union Univ., Beijing, China","Nonlinear Dynamics and Synchronization, 2009. INDS '09. 2nd International Workshop on","20090901","2009","","","203","208","Although neural networks and idiotypic networks are similar in functions, they are different in many aspects. This paper compares them in topological structures, initializing ways, learning methods, et al. Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved. Thirdly, clone expansion of antibodies is suppressed by idiotypic effects, thus false positive rate is decreased. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this adaptive detection approach. Compared with the detection approach based on a multilayer perception network, the false positive rate is decreased and the detection accuracy of unknown attacks is increased.","1866-7791","978-1-4244-3844-0","","10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228006","idiotypic networks;intrusion detection;neural networks;pattern recognition","Computer networks;Detection algorithms;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Learning systems;Mechatronics;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Pattern recognition","multilayer perceptrons;security of data","Fisher Iris dataset;KDD-CUP-99 database;adaptive detection approach;adaptive intrusion detection approach;antigens;idiotypic networks;initializing ways;learning methods;multilayer perception network;neural networks;pattern recognition technology;topological structures","","5","","11","","","20-21 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Third International Symposium on","20070910","2007","","","209","214","Psyco-Virt is a high assurance intrusion detection tool that merges host and network intrusion detection technologies with virtual machine introspection. Psyco-Virt architecture includes a cluster of virtual machines, the monitored VMs, which run the OS and applications of interest, and a further VM, the introspection one. Several agents distributed across the monitored VMs execute network and host IDS tools to discover attempted intrusions/attacks on the monitored VMs. The introspection VM makes the detection tools trustworthy by running an introspector and a director to discover any attempt to maliciously modify the kernel, the agents and the IDSes hosted on a monitored VM. On each monitored VM a collector gathers the alerts generated by the agents and forwards them to the director through a control network dedicated to data exchange among the agents and the introspection VM. The director on the introspection VM filters all the alerts and delegates the execution of a proper action to a notifier whenever an intrusion or an attempt to modify the IDSes is detected. In such cases, a monitored VM can either be stopped or frozen and its current state saved in a file for a later, deeper inspection. After describing Psyco-Virt, we discuss some examples of agents and functions using introspection and present preliminary results and performance figures of a first prototype.","","0-7695-2876-7","978-0-7695-2876-2","10.1109/IAS.2007.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299776","integrity;introspection;intrusion detection;network security;system;virtual machines","Buildings;Condition monitoring;Filters;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Voice mail","security of data;virtual machines","Psyco-Virt architecture;data exchange;high assurance intrusion detection tool;network intrusion detection technologies;trustworthy intrusion detection;virtual machine introspection","","6","2","26","","","29-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
