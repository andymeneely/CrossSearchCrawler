Current approaches defend against these attacks by applying data integrity or control flow integrity control methods. However, they focus on only a certain aspect and cannot give a complete integrity monitoring solution. This paper tries our best to find out all resorts that violate the kernel integrity of operating system by analyzing what objects an action of the kernel relies on and affects. Then we examine all these objects to avoid them from being tamped with and also monitor whether the effect of an action of the kernel is the same as the semantics specified by the original design. Our operating system integrity surveillance system (OSISS) is implemented in a virtual machine monitor (VMM) and it can detect abnormity of an action by monitoring the data integrity and control flow integrity with acceptable performance loss.","","978-1-4244-9762-1","","10.1109/CSSS.2011.5973957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5973957","","Kernel;Monitoring;Registers;Security;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors","data integrity;operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","OSISS;VMM;control flow integrity control methods;data integrity;kernel-level attacks;operating system integrity surveillance system;operating system kernel integrity;operating system security;virtual machine monitor","","0","","11","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, access control mechanisms deal with allow or deny a based rule (for access to a file) which even extends to role based access control in some cases. This directly implies that access protection mechanism is generally tightly coupled with almost all operating systems. Still, intrusion is a common phenomenon.

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","","","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","1","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rapid and infrastructure-less deployment in emergency and military situations make these networks unique. However, certain inherently vulnerable characteristics lead to security concerns, which can prove especially damaging in sensitive situations like military operations. Intrusion prevention measures are not guaranteed to work all the time since unrelenting attackers can eventually break them down. An intrusion detection scheme (IDS) monitors a network and looks for intrusions, thus forming a second wall of defense. In this paper, we have proposed a misuse detection -based IDS for MANETs. Our protocol-independent design makes use of a self-adjusting threshold scheme and detects a priori known attack patterns with over 90% accuracy and is generally insensitive to false alarms.

They have many potential applications for both civil and military tasks. However, the unattended nature of WSNs and the limited computational and energy resources of their nodes make them susceptible to many types of attacks. Intrusion detection is one of the major and efficient defence methods against attacks in a network infrastructure. Intrusion Detection Systems can be seen as the second line of defence and they complement the security primitives that are adopted in order to prevent attacks against the computer network being protected. The peculiar features of a wireless sensor network pose stringent requirements to the design of intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, lightweight, distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks. This IDS uses both misuse-based and anomaly-based detection techniques. It is composed of a Central Agent, which performs highly accurate intrusion detection by using data mining techniques, and a number of Local Agents running lighter anomaly-based detection techniques on the motes. Decision trees have been adopted as classification algorithm in the detection process of the Central Agent and their behaviour has been analysed in selected attacks scenarios. The accuracy of the proposed IDS has been measured and validated through an extensive experimental campaign. This paper presents the results of these experimental tests.","","","","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681236","Wireless Sensor Networks;data mining;decision trees;intrusion detection","Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;pattern classification;wireless sensor networks","WSN;anomaly-based detection technique;attack prevention;central agent;civil task;classification algorithm;computational resource;computer network protection;data mining technique;decision tree;defence method;distributed IDS;energy resource;hybrid IDS;intrusion detection system;lightweight IDS;local agent;military task;misuse-based detection technique;network infrastructure;security primitive;wireless sensor network","","1","","25","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main aim of this research is to understand the security threats and identify a security technique used to mitigate them in cloud computing. The intrusion detection will be undertaken on the basis of anomaly-detection on the data generated from the transactions captured within the cloud network.

However, most applications are not well prepared for unforeseeable faults, still relying on primitive fault tolerance techniques. Considering that ever-plunging mean time to interrupt (MTTI) is making scientific applications more vulnerable to faults, it is increasingly important to provide users not only an improved fault tolerant environment, but also a framework to support their own fault tolerance policies so that their allocation times can be best utilized. This paper addresses a user level fault tolerance policy management based on a holistic approach to digest and correlate fault related information. It introduces simple semantics with which users express their policies on faults, and illustrates how event correlation techniques can be applied to manage and determine the most preferable user policies. The paper also discusses an implementation of the framework using open source software, and demonstrates, as an example, how a molecular dynamics simulation application running on the institutional cluster at Oak Ridge National Laboratory benefits from it.","","978-1-4244-9879-6","978-0-7695-4330-7","10.1109/POLICY.2011.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976791","","Biomedical monitoring;Correlation;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Monitoring;Registers;Software","fault tolerant computing;public domain software;user interfaces","fault correlation approach;mean time-to-interrupt;molecular dynamics simulation application;open source software;supercomputing center;supercomputing scheduling policy;user level fault tolerant policy management;user policy","","1","","23","","","6-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Internet software developers have to create more complex systems while enduring the pressuring time to market. Therefore, end-host software have bugs, vulnerabilities and cannot be trusted. That's why, among others, network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), firewall or other network devices monitor such software to prevent unexpected behaviors. However, their functionalities are limited by design, because they can only handle a configuration of predefined monolithic protocol layerings. In this paper we present Luth, a midpoint inspection device that relies on the composition and parallelization of predefined midpoint inspectors (MI). We present the main functionalities offered by its configuration language and interpreter. Finally, we benchmark a prototype implemented in OCaml.

It is vital for a system administrator or network manager to be able to analyze the vast amount of log data in order to detect suspicious behaviors or patterns, possibly due to malicious users/applications or faulty devices. While an intrusion detection system (IDS) log can provide a large number of warnings, exactly which alarms are true while the others are false, and more importantly what are the underlying causes are still difficult to know. To bridge the gap between network log and anomaly discovery, we design and implement a visualization tool that combines multiple commodity visualizations with minimum learning curve. While each individual view is well understood, the effects of such views in analyzing network anomalies are not well studied. Since each visualization technique has advantages as well as limitations in addressing a particular task, we show that these views, when combined and linked together, may provide an effective and lightweight network anomaly analysis tool. The web-based open platform may simplify network administration as well as promote collaborative analysis among researchers.","","","","10.1109/PacificVis.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787176","Network Anomaly Visualization","Data visualization;Image color analysis;Joining processes;Market research;Security;Servers;Visualization","Internet;computer network management;computer network security;data analysis;data visualisation","IDS log;Web-based open platform;anomaly detection;collaborative analysis;faulty devices;interactive visualization;intrusion detection system log;large-scale networks;log data analysis;malicious applications;malicious users;minimum learning curve;multiple commodity visualizations;network anomaly analysis tool;network management;suspicious behavior detection;suspicious pattern detection","","1","","14","","","4-7 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research proposes the feature reduction technique, which is designed to identify a subset of informative features that are representatives of the whole dataset. In our methodology, manufacturing data are pre-processed and adopted as inputs. Subsequently, the feature selection process is performed by wrapping Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier. To improve the performance, the proposed technique was parallelized with MapReduce. The results show that the number of features can be reduced by 50% with 83.12% accuracy.

Such techniques are not constructed based on the understanding of EEG and brain functions, neither inspired by the understanding of emotional dynamics. Hence, the features are difficult to be interpreted and yield low classification performance. In this study, a new feature extraction technique using Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is proposed. The features are extracted from the weights of data-driven self-organizing feature map that are adjusted during training to optimize the error obtained from the desired output and the calculated output. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is then employed to perform classification on fear, happiness, sadness and calm emotions. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of classifying emotions from EEG signals captured on 12 children aged between 4 to 6 years old ranging from 84.18% to 89.29%. In addition, classification performance for features derived from other techniques such as Power Spectrum Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are also presented as a standard benchmark for comparison purpose. It is observed that the proposed approach is able to yield accuracy of 33.77% to 55% as compared to the respective comparison features.

Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","265","271","A common method of identifying attacks with anomaly network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is to detect significant deviations in network traffic compared to normal conditions. Such changes may include unexpected high traffic volume, caused by, for example, a denial of service (DoS) attack. However, recent research on traffic engineering has demonstrated that modern data network traffic exhibits high burstiness at a wide range of observation window sizes, i.e., self-similarity (V. Paxon et al., 1995, W.E. Leland et al., 1994), The self-similar traffic may challenge the traditional anomaly NIDS by making it unable to distinguish attacks from traffic bursts. In this paper, we investigate the employment of low pass filters in the anomaly NIDS to smooth the burstiness in network traffic measurements and thus reduce the false alarms. We studied the use of the MWA filter and the Savitzky-Golay filter. By analyzing the resulting network traffic measurements, we found out that the MWA filter significantly changed, while the Savitzky-Golay filter only moderately altered, the statistical properties of the network traffic measurements. To investigate the effectiveness of a low pass filter on anomaly NIDS, we applied the low pass filter to our anomaly NIDS, namely, the MIB anomaly intrusion detection (MAID) system. By employing these filters in MAID, we observed that the Savitzky-Golay filter outperforms the MWA filter. The results of the performance evaluation process also demonstrated that the low pass filter can significantly enhance the detection capacity of MAID, by reducing its false alarm rate.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437826","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437826","","Area measurement;Computer crime;Employment;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Low pass filters;Read only memory;Telecommunication traffic;Time measurement;Volume measurement","computer networks;low-pass filters;performance evaluation;security of data;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","MWA filter;Savitzky-Golay filter;anomaly network intrusion detection system;denial of service attack;low pass filters;management information base;network traffic;self-similar traffic;traffic engineering","","0","","8","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we survey and classify the solutions that have been proposed in the literature for this attack and propose a decentralized scheme for intrusion detection based on the theory of diffusion of innovations.

Several of them are not sufficient and effective. Many intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or their efficiency, but they do not address the security problems. A number of nodes may be selfish meaning that by not forwarding the packets to the target, thereby cutting back the battery power. Some others may act malevolent by commencement of security attacks similar to denial of service or hack the data. The ultimate aim of the protection solutions for wireless networks is to offer security services, for instance confidentiality, authentication, accessibility, integrity, and secrecy to mobile users. This paper proposes a muiltier intrusion detection system. Here three tiers are application, routing and trust. The data transfer takes place between different nodes. First a trusted connection is established between different nodes. Second the routing policy is conformed for all nodes. Finally at the application layer data is routed on the type of application. The node not following trust or routing policy is considered a malicious node. In this research we have simulated different types of attacks and also provided pseudo code for different attacks like route invasion, eavesdrop, sinkhole.

In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network.","","0-7803-9477-1","","10.1109/VIZSEC.2005.1532065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532065","","Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Computer networks;Data analysis;Data security;Data visualization;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Telecommunication traffic","data visualisation;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","information visualization;intrusion detection analysis;packet-level analysis;time-based network traffic visualizer;visual network traffic analysis","","11","","27","","","26 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has been widely used as an important component in protecting online service towards Web attacks and evasions. Yet, today's architectures for intrusion detection force the IDS designer to make a difficult choice to place IDS, so that it can protect itself from a direct attack. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework to safeguard IDS from a direct attack. Simply called zero administrative server (ZAS), the system incorporates IDS in a virtual machine (VM) environment. VM offers strong isolation for IDS from the monitored services and provides significant resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, this VM based WWW server has the ability to monitor the network traffic to the running services; analyse the information obtained and detect the intrusion; alienate the intruder from the services; and reconstruct the corrupted data or damaged files caused by the evasion. In this paper, we demonstrate ZAS by exposing it to several attacking tools as well as to show the effects it takes on the network performance in terms of TCP throughput and application-to-application round trip time.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276470","Checksum;Intrusion Detection System;Virtual Machine;WWW Server","File servers;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection;Testing;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server;World Wide Web","Web services;security of data;virtual machines","VM based autonomous Web server;Web attacks;intrusion detection systems;malicious attacks;network performance testing;online services;virtual machine;zero administrative server","","0","","16","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing NFA/DFA and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well on the important issues on multi-core architecture design, such as load balancing, data locality and communication between cores.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-7114-0","","10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560073","","Automata;Bandwidth;Complexity theory;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Multicore processing;Program processors","computer viruses;finite automata;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","attack signatures;data locality;deep packet inspection;hybrid regular expression matching;layer-7 filtering;load balancing;multicore architecture;network intrusion detection;network security;nondeterministic finite automata;open-source intrusion detection;payload portion;space complexity;traffic monitoring;viruses","","3","1","27","","","2-5 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This technique is not suited to find the signatures of DDoS attack, which is formless. Also, DDoS is in general the combination of different forms of denial of service (DoS). As a result, it is difficult to find the exact signature of attack. Moreover, it is very difficult to distinguish the difference between an unusual high traffic which is caused by the attack, and the flash crowds which normally occur when a huge number of users use the target machine at the same time. In fact, this difference should only be observed from analyzing the data in the packet header. In this paper, we propose to discover the DDoS attacking signature by analyzing the TCP/IP packet header against the well defined rules and conditions, and distinguish the difference between normal and abnormal traffic. We here observe three groups or delegates of DDoS attacking, i.e., ICMP flood, UDP flood and TCP SYN flood, and present convincing preliminary experiments.","","0-7803-8593-4","","10.1109/ISCIT.2004.1412917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1412917","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Data analysis;Electronic mail;Floods;IP networks;Internet;Knowledge engineering;Protocols;TCPIP","computer networks;packet switching;quality of service;security of data;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","DDoS attacking signature;DoS;ICMP flood;TCP SYN flood;TCP/IP header;UDP flood;abnormal traffic;distributed denial of service detection;flash crowds;normal traffic;packet header data;protocol level traffic measurement analysis;target machine;traffic measurement analysis;unusual high traffic","","8","","25","","","26-29 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing approaches like those based on n-gram or Common String (CS), which simply breaks payload into equal-length pieces or attempts to find a frequent itemset, are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram and CS approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing prior approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2358857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6902777","Network traffic analysis;network traffic identification;protocol reverse engineering;unsupervised information extraction","Algorithm design and analysis;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols;Redundancy","Internet;computer network management;protocols;unsupervised learning","ProWord approach;application protocols;common string;deep packet analysis rules;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram;network management system;network measurement system;network security system;ranking algorithm;traffic payload;unsupervised protocol feature word extraction;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting experts algorithm","","0","","44","","2014-09-18","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Innate immunity protects the body from the known invaders whereas adaptive immunity develops a memory of past encounter and has the ability to learn about previously unknown pathogens. These salient features of the HIS are inspiring the researchers in the area of intrusion detection to develop automated and adaptive defensive tools. This paper presents a new variant of Conserved Self Pattern Recognition Algorithm (CSPRA) called CSPRA-ID (CSPRA for Intrusion Detection). The CSPRA-ID is given the capability of effectively identifying known intrusions by utilizing the knowledge of well-known attacks to build a conserved self pattern (APC detector) while it retains the ability to detect novel intrusions because of the nature of one-class classification of the T detectors. Furthermore, the T detectors in the CSPRA-ID are generated with a novel near-deterministic scheme that is proposed in this paper. The near-deterministic generation scheme places the detector with Brute Force method to guarantee the next detector to be very foreign to the existing detector. Moreover, the placement of the variable-sized detector is online determined during the Monte Carlo estimate of detector coverage and thus the detectors with an optimal distribution are generated without any additional optimization step. A comparative study between CSPRA-ID and one-class SVM shows that the CSPRA-ID is promising on DARPA network intrusion data in terms of detection accuracy and computation efficiency.","","978-1-4244-9905-2","","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949393","CSPRA;comparison;detector generation;intrusion detection;near-deterministic","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Iris;Monte Carlo methods;Testing","Monte Carlo methods;artificial immune systems;computer network security;pattern recognition;support vector machines","CSPRA-ID;DARPA network-based intrusion detection;Monte Carlo estimation;SVM;T detectors;brute force method;conserved selfpattern recognition algorithm;human immune system;near-deterministic detector generation","","1","","18","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The strategy significantly cuts down the effective memory access latencies and efficiently utilizes the memory bandwidth. Also, it maximizes the effects of the multithreading capability of the GPU through optimal thread scheduling.

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks and therefore the security is a more significant issue than in infrastructure-type wireless networks. In these networks, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts, as the topology of the network changes dynamically. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which the malicious host is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious host inside the network. In those methods usually a baseline profile is defined in accordance to static training data and then they are used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus avoiding any malicious host to be joined in the network. Since the topology of a MANET is dynamically changing, use of a static profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection scheme based on a learning process, so that the training data can be updated at particular time intervals.

International Conference on","20061211","2006","","","135","142","Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) have become widely recognized as a powerful tool and an important element of IT security safeguards. Essential to every network intrusion prevention system is the ability to search through packets and identify patterns that match known attacks. Resource- and time-efficient string matching algorithms are therefore important for identifying these packets at the line rate. Recently these systems have become a target of attacks - the example is the infamous Witty worm. The devices which use algorithms with low worst-case performance could be a target of algorithmic complexity attacks. For example, poorly prepared hash tables can degenerate to linked lists with carefully chosen input. An attacker can effectively compute an input data that will diminish the device throughput. This can lead to denial of service attacks, which are very dangerous for networks and computational environments. In this article new hardware implementation architecture of the Karp-Rabin algorithm was introduced. The result is a software, which generates a pattern matching module that could be easily used to create intrusion prevention systems implemented in reconfigurable hardware. The prepared module matches the subset of the Snort IPS signatures achieving throughput of over 2 Gbps and have the worst-case performance similar to the best-case one.

A wireless network for indoor intrusion detection is based on several sensors that are deployed over the monitored area for detecting possible risky situations and triggering appropriate actions in response. The network needs to support traffic patterns with different characteristics and quality constraints. Namely, it should provide a periodic low-power monitoring service and, in case of intrusion detection, a real-time alarm propagation mechanism over inherently unreliable wireless links subject to fluctuations of the signal power. Following the guidelines introduced by recent standardization, this paper proposes the design of a wireless network prototype able to satisfy the specifics of the intrusion detection application. A proprietary medium access control is developed based on the low-power SimpliciTI radio stack. Network performance is assessed by experimental measurements using a test-bed operating at 868MHz in an indoor office environment with severe multipath and non line-of-sight propagation conditions.","","978-1-4673-0681-2","","10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215493","","Communication system security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Sensors;Synchronization;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;alarm systems;indoor communication;safety systems;surveillance;wireless sensor networks","M2M networks;SimpliciTI radio stack;frequency 868 MHz;indoor intrusion detection;medium access control;multipath propagation;nonline-of-sight propagation;periodic low power monitoring service;protocol design;real time alarm propagation mechanism;smart surveillance;wireless machine-to-machine;wireless network prototype;wireless networks","","0","","14","","","1-1 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Distributed monitoring of conditional entropy for anomaly detection in streams","Arackaparambil, C.; Bratus, S.; Brody, J.; Shubina, A.","Dept. of Comput.

We study the problem in the context of network streams where the problem has received significant attention. Monitoring the empirical Shannon entropy of a feature in a network packet stream has previously been shown to be useful in detecting anomalies in the network traffic. Entropy is an information-theoretic statistic that measures the variability of the feature under consideration. Anomalous activity in network traffic can be captured by detecting changes in this variability. There are several challenges, however, in monitoring this statistic. Computing the statistic efficiently is non-trivial. Further, when monitoring multiple features, the streaming algorithms proposed previously would likely fail to keep up with the ever-increasing channel bandwidth of network traffic streams. There is also the concern that an adversary could attempt to mask the effect of his attacks on variability by a mimicry attack disguising his traffic to mimic the distribution of normal traffic in the network, thus avoiding detection by an entropy monitoring sensor. Also, the high rate of false positives is a big problem with Intrusion Detection Systems, and the case of entropy monitoring is no different. In this work we propose a way to address the above challenges. First, we leverage recent progress in sketching algorithms to develop a distributed approach for computing entropic statistics accurately, at reasonable memory costs. Secondly, we propose monitoring not only regular entropy, but the related statistic of conditional entropy, as a more reliable measure in detecting anomalies. We implement our approach and evaluate it with real data collected at the link layer of an 802.11 wireless network.","","978-1-4244-6533-0","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470852","","Bandwidth;Condition monitoring;Costs;Distributed computing;Entropy;Intrusion detection;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","entropy;radio networks;statistical analysis;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 wireless network;anomaly detection;channel bandwidth;conditional entropy distributed monitoring approach;empirical Shannon entropy monitoring;entropy monitoring sensor;information stream monitoring;intrusion detection systems;link layer;network packet stream algorithm;network traffic","","5","","22","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the Internet becomes the platform of daily activities, the threat of network attack is also become more serious. Firewall along is not able to protect the system from being attacked through normal service channel. Furthermore, most of the current intrusion detection system focuses on the border of organization network. If the attack comes from inside, this setup does not provide any protection to hosts in the local network and the network itself. Therefore, we need to use other mechanism to protect the critical system as well as the network itself.

IEEE","20060123","2005","3","","6 pp.","","Fast virus scanning is becoming increasingly important in today's Internet. While Moore's law continues to double CPU cycle speed, virus scanning applications fail to ride on the performance wave due to their frequent random memory accesses. This paper proposes Hash-AV, a virus scanning ""booster"" technique that aims to take advantage of improvements in CPU performance. Using a set of hash functions and a bloom filter array that fits in CPU second-level (L2) caches, Hash-AV determines the majority of ""no-match"" cases without accesses to main memory. Experiments show that Hash-AV improves the performance of the open-source virus scanner Clam-AV by a factor of 2.5 to 10. The key to Hash-AV's success lies in a set of ""bad but cheap"" hash functions that are used as initial hashes. The speed of Hash-AV makes it well suited for ""on-access"" virus scanning, providing greater protections to the user. Through intercepting system calls and wrapping glibc libraries, we have implemented an ""on-access"" version for Hash-AV+Clam-AV. The on-access scanner can examine input data at a throughput of over 200 Mb/s, making it suitable for network-based virus scanning.","","0-7803-9414-3","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2005.1577953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1577953","","Application software;Central Processing Unit;Hardware;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput;Viruses (medical)","Internet;computer viruses;cryptography;filtering theory","CPU cycle speed;CPU second-level caches;Clam-AV;Hash-AV;Internet;bloom filter array;cache-resident filters;fast virus signature scanning;glibc libraries wrapping;hash functions;on-access scanner;open-source virus scanner;random memory accesses;system calls interception","","12","7","25","","","28 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, based on frequency patterns (FP) and tree patterns (TP) for intrusion detection respectively. FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to quickly find out frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences.","","978-1-4244-2113-8","978-1-4244-2114-5","10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4593135","Frequency pattern (FP);Information security;Intrusion Detection;System-call sequence;Tree pattern (TP)","Aquaculture;Automation;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency;Hidden Markov models;Information security;Intelligent control;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","data mining;security of data","FP;TP;computer intrusions;computer system;frequency patterns;information security;intrusion detection;operating system;sequential mining;short sequence model;system-call sequences;tree patterns","","1","","14","","","25-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper develops support for exploiting such data parallelism for a class of non-numeric, non-graphic applications, which perform computations while traversing many independent, irregular data structures. While the traversal of any one irregular data structure does not give opportunity for parallelization, traversing a set of these does. However, mapping such parallelism to SIMD units is nontrivial and not addressed in prior work. We address this problem by developing an intermediate language for specifying such traversals, followed by a run-time scheduler that maps traversals to SIMD units. A key idea in our run-time scheme is converting branches to arithmetic operations, which then allows us to use SIMD hardware. In order to make our approach fast, we demonstrate several optimizations including a stream compaction method that aids with control flow in SIMD, a set of layouts that reduce memory latency, and a tiling approach that enables more effective prefetching.

Due to the critical nature of such applications, security issues are of significant importance. WSNs are vulnerable to different types of attacks since they are often deployed in hostile and unprotected environments. In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection approach, called PCADID, for detecting routing attacks in WSNs. In the approach, we partition a WSN into groups of sensor nodes. In each group, some nodes are selected as monitor nodes, which cooperate with each other to compose a global normal profile. Every monitor node establishes a subprofile of its own normal network traffic using principal component analysis (PCA) and sends it to other monitor nodes. Every monitor node composes the global normal profile based upon all received subprofiles and uses it to detect anomalies in its own network traffic. As the normal network behavior changes over time, the global normal profile is updated. We demonstrate that PCADID achieves a high detection rate with a low false alarm rate, while minimizes the communication overhead and energy consumption in the network.","","978-1-4244-9153-7","","10.1109/CNDS.2011.5764585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764585","distributed intrusion detection;principal component analysis;routing attack;wireless sensor network","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Support vector machine classification;Training;Wireless sensor networks","principal component analysis;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","PCADID;communication overhead;distributed intrusion detection;global normal profile;monitor nodes;network traffic using;principal component analysis;routing attacks;sensor nodes;wireless sensor networks","","2","","15","","","23-24 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DDD maintains ensembles with different diversity levels and is able to attain better accuracy than other approaches. Furthermore, it is very robust, outperforming other drift handling approaches in terms of accuracy when there are false positive drift detections.

These digital documents are the most important asset of an organization and are hence the chief target of insider abuse. Security policies provide the first step to prevent abuse by defining proper and improper usage of resources. Coarse grained security policies that operate on the ""principle of least privilege"" [J. H. Saltzer et al., (1974)] alone are not enough to address the insider threat, since the typical insider possesses a wide range of privileges to start with. In this paper, we propose a security policy that is tailored to prevent insider abuse. We define the concept of subject, object, actions, rights, context and information flow as applicable to the document control domain. Access is allowed based on the principles of ""least privilege and minimum requirements"", subject to certain constraints. Unlike existing techniques, the proposed policy engine considers, among other factors, the context of a document request and the information flow between such requests to identify potential malicious insiders. Enforcing these fine-grained access control policies gives us a better platform to prevent the insider abuse. Finally, for demonstration purposes, we present a framework that can be used to specify and enforce these policies on Microsoft Word documents, one of the popular document formats.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377237","Access Control;Digital Documents;Information Flow;Insider Threat","Access control;Collaboration;Computer hacking;Computer security;Contracts;Cryptography;Humans;Information management;Protection;Research and development","Internet;authorisation;computer crime;document handling","Microsoft Word document;access control;digital document;document control domain;information flow;insider threat;least privilege minimum requirement;online technology;security policy","","11","1","22","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wireless network is based on ldquostarrdquo topology by using the IEEE 802.11 series of standards in wireless local area networks (WLAN). Security for wireless communications between the sensors and central node is achieved in real-time through the proposed uncertainty classification of network traffic with little and negligible run-time overhead for hacker or threat detection. A correlation-based feature selection algorithm is utilized in the central node for improved intrusion detection speed and accuracy by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features in the feature space. Uncertainty problems are solved using the fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) intrusion detector, which incorporates the fuzzy clustering technique with the Dempster-Shafer theory. Also, the detection process is made more efficient using the k-NN technique. Experimental results show up to 94% detection rate of potential threats and intrusions, which indicate a significant performance increase compared with three other classifiers.","","978-0-7695-3473-2","978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780662","","Cameras;Data security;IP networks;Network topology;Streaming media;Surveillance;Uncertainty;Wireless LAN;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","IEEE standards;IP networks;audio signal processing;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication standards;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless sensor networks","Dempster-Shafer theory;IEEE 802.11 standard;Internet protocol surveillance camera;audio data transmission;centralized management unit;correlation-based feature selection;fuzzy belief k-nearest neighbours;fuzzy clustering;hacking;intrusion detection;k-NN technique;network security;network traffic;real time streaming protocol;secured IP based surveillance network;star topology;threat detection;video data transmission;wireless communication;wireless local area network;wireless sensor network","","0","","30","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article first gives a tutorial of each basic component of a security gateway, including the firewall, content filtering, network address translation (NAT), the virtual private network (VPN), and the intrusion detection system (IDS). The building of an integrated security gateway, using various open-source packages, is then described. Conflicts among the packages are resolved to ensure interoperability. Next, we internally/externally evaluate the performance of each component with six commercial implementations to identify the problems for future research directions. Readers can understand how these components deliver secure operations, how a packet can properly traverse through such a gateway, and how many resources are consumed in each software component. Selected packages include the Linux kernel, ipchains (packet filter), Squid (URL filter), FWTK (content filter), FreeS/WAN (VPN), and Snort (IDS). ipchains and FreeS/WAN are found viable, but FWTK and Snort suffer performance problems. Further examining their source code and data structures reveals the improper implementation in FWTK and the less scalable linear matching algorithms in ipchains and Snort. Finally, several approaches to scale up these software components are suggested to improve the performance. Note that installing such a security gateway does not mean secured. This study focuses on building a product-like security gateway and on evaluating its performance.

Two key observations facilitate the model formulation: first, different anomaly detectors have different detection coverage and blind spots; second, diverse operating environments provide different kinds of information to reveal anomalies. After formulating the cooperation between basic detectors as a partially observable Markov decision process, a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to search in an optimal cooperation manner, with the objective to achieve broader detection coverage and fewer false alerts. Furthermore, the coordinator's behavior can be adjusted easily by setting a reward signal to meet the diverse demands of changing system situations. A preliminary experiment is implemented, together with some comparative studies, to demonstrate the coordinator's performance in terms of admitted criteria.","","0-7695-2282-3","","10.1109/DSN.2005.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467786","","Concrete;Detectors;Information science;Intelligent networks;Learning;Scalability;Wireless sensor networks","Markov processes;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;security of data","Markov decision process;autonomic detection coordinator;blind spots;host-based intrusive anomalies;multiagent learning problem;multilayered boundary construction;observation-specific anomaly detector;policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm","","3","1","23","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results show that the novel model and its algorithm quickens the affinity maturation process of detector population and stably increases the detection rate along with increasing evolutionary generation; but in Kim's conceptual mode, the affinity maturation process of detector population takes more time, the detection rate falls into a little degradation and maintains invariant for a long time.","","978-1-4244-3893-8","978-1-4244-3894-5","10.1109/IWISA.2009.5073094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5073094","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Degradation;Detectors;Evolutionary computation;Intrusion detection;Libraries;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Vaccines","artificial immune systems;evolutionary computation;security of data","affinity maturation process;artificial immune model;detector population;immune evolutionary algorithm;negative selection algorithm;network intrusion detection;vaccine operator","","0","","13","","","23-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel distributed intrusion detection system, which uses the Dempster-Shafer's theory of evidence to fuse local information. Our approach is composed of 2 layers: the lower layer consists of both host and network based sensors, which are specifically designed to collect local features and make local decisions to differentiate those easy-to-detect attacks; the upper layer is a fusion control center, it makes global decisions on those locally uncertain events by adopting Dempster's combination rule. Our approach gains the advantages of both host and network based intrusion methods, and can practice both rule-based and anomaly detection. A simulation is carried out and result shows that the multi-sensor data fusion model performs much better than single sensor.","","0-7803-8273-0","","10.1109/WCICA.2004.
