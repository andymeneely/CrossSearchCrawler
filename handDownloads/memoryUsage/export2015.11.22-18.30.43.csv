The ideas presented are general enough to be applied immediately to the development of any software system. We built a NASA-specific requirement fault taxonomy and processes for tailoring the taxonomy to a class of software projects or to a specific project. We examined requirement faults for six systems, including the International Space Station (ISS), and enhanced the taxonomy and processes.

Advanced IDS go beyond packet header and examine packet payload to detect content-based security threats. But payload scanning is intensive task in IDS, since each packet must be compared against thousands of predefined attacks at multigigabit rate. Software based IDS achieve throughput only at the rate of Mbps, whereas hardware based solutions achieve higher throughput at the rate of Gbps. In this paper we present an optimized hash based algorithm called Word Split Hash algorithm (WSHA) to compare payload against attacks. In previous hash based algorithms the elimination or detection of virus is at last stage after finding hash for the whole word but in WSHA we will do checks after finding subhash values at many stages and also in the final stage. Hence throughput is increased. Also only a bit comparison is carried out for checking purpose after finding the subhash values. So the memory space utilized will be very much reduced. This string matching algorithm can be implemented in FPGA, which can provide very fast and efficient scanning with less memory space occupied. They are designed and simulated in VHDL using Modelsim tool.","","978-1-4244-4789-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204400","Field programmable gate array;Hash;Network intrusion detection System;payload scanning","Communication system traffic control;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Throughput","computer networks;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;string matching;telecommunication traffic","FPGA;Modelsim tool;VHDL;Word Split Hash algorithm;content-based security threats;hardware based pattern matching;hash based algorithm;high speed network;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;packet header;packet inspection;packet payload;payload scanning;string matching algorithm;virus detection","","0","","10","","","4-6 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is important to investigate the vulnerabilities of ICSs in order to solve the threats and attacks against critical infrastructure to protect human lives and assets. PLC is the basic building block of an ICS. If PLCs are exploited, overall system will be exposed to the threat.

However, security modules in conventional kernel-level reference monitors are usually not portable to other kernels and require detailed knowledge about kernel internals. Furthermore, different security modules are often not composable and conflict with each other. This paper describes a reference monitor called SysGuard that addresses these problems. SysGuard uses modules called guards that are invoked before or after the execution of system calls. Unlike kernel-specific security modules, guards are attached to standard system calls that enhance their portability. The guard scoping on a per-process basis improves composability of individual guards, and it is implemented efficiently by using a per-process jump table of system calls. This paper describes the implementation of restricted execution environments for networks by composing simple and portable guards, and shows the advantages of the SysGuard security framework.","","0-7695-1852-4","","10.1109/PRDC.2002.1185635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185635","","Access control;Computer bugs;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Guidelines;Kernel;Monitoring;Operating systems;Portable computers;Security","authorisation;operating system kernels;software portability;system monitoring","SysGuard;access control;guards;networks;operating system kernels;per-process jump table;portable composable kernel module;reference monitors;restricted execution environments;security modules;system calls","","2","","19","","","16-18 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","","978-1-4244-0973-0","978-1-4244-0973-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because WSNs in general and in nature are unattended and physically reachable from the outside world, they could be vulnerable to physical attacks in the form of node capture or node destruction. These forms of attacks are hard to protect against and require intelligent prevention methods. It is necessary for WSNs to have security measures in place as to prevent an intruder from inserting compromised nodes in order to decimate or disturb the network performance. In this paper we present an intrusion detection algorithm for wireless sensor networks which does not require prior knowledge of network behavior or a learning period in order to establish this knowledge. We have taken a more practical approach and constructed this algorithm with small to middle-size networks in mind, like home or office networks. The proposed algorithm is also dynamic in nature as to cope with new and unknown attack types. This algorithm is intended to protect the network and ensure reliable and accurate aggregated sensor readings. Theoretical simulation results indicate that compromised nodes can be detected with high accuracy and low false alarm probability.","","978-1-4577-0786-5","","10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2011.5940938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5940938","Intrusion Detection;Security;Wireless Sensor Network","Base stations;Clustering algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","WSN;intelligent prevention method;intrusion detection algorithm;network protection;node destruction;wireless sensor network","","0","","12","","","Feb. 28 2011-March 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many problems are still not well resolved in most of IDS, such as detection evasion, intrusion containment. In order to resolve these problems, we propose a novel flexible architecture VNIDA which is based on virtual machine monitor (VMM) and has no-intrusive behavior to target system after studying popular IDS architectures. In this architecture, a separate intrusion detection domain (IDD) is added to provide intrusion detection services for all virtual machines. Specially, an IDD helper is introduced to take response to the intrusions according to the security policies. Moreover, event sensors and IDS stub, as the core components of IDS, are separately isolated from target systems, so strong reliability is also achieved in this architecture. To show the feasibility of the VNIDA, we implement a prototype based on the proposed architecture. Based on the prototype, we employed some rootkits to evaluate our VNIDA, and the results shows that VNIDA has the ability to detect them efficiently, even some potential intrusions. In addition, system performance evaluation also shows that VNIDA only introduce less than 1.25% extra overhead.","","978-0-7695-3090-1","","10.1109/WKDD.2008.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470467","","Buildings;Computer architecture;Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Open source software;Prototypes;Software engineering","authorisation;software architecture;virtual machines","detection evasion;intrusion containment;intrusion detection domain;intrusion detection system;security policies;system resource;unauthorized access prevention;virtual machine monitor","","2","","22","","","23-24 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We begin by categorizing potential vulnerabilities in a generic IDS and classifying methods used to enhance IDS survivability. We then propose an efficient fault tolerance based Survivable IDS (SIDS) along with a systematic way to transform an original IDS architecture into this survivable architecture. Key components of SIDS include: a dual-functionality forward-ahead (DFFA) structure, backup communication paths, component recycling, system reconfiguration, and an anomaly detector.

For cloud security insurance, however, the question of differential security coverage is relevant as the cost of deploying special protection, detection and response tools varies and requires the coverage estimation.

Many intrusions aren't composed by single events, but a series of attack steps in chronological order. Analyzing the order in which events occur can improve the attack detection accuracy and reduce false alarms. This is because, very often, intrusion is a multi step process in which a number of events must occur sequentially in order to launch a successful attack. Therefore, sequential pattern mining algorithms are applied to intrusion detection to mine the order correlation about time sequential data, and then it can detect this kind of attack. Sequential pattern mining is an important data mining problem with broad applications.

Our approach doesn't require any direct operator oversight, but all components are subject to policies established by their owners to prevent undesirable behavior or system misuse. The whole approach is validated in a high-level network model with worm propagation scenario","","1-4244-0944-6","1-4244-0945-4","10.1109/KIMAS.2007.369840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4227579","","Ad hoc networks;Collaborative work;Communication networks;Cybernetics;Filters;Humans;Intrusion detection;Joining processes;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","computer network management;multi-agent systems;security of data;telecommunication security","adaptive agent-based mechanism;autonomous agent-based mechanism;autonomous protection mechanism;coalition operations;decentralized agent-based mechanism;efficient communication network;joint network protection;network intrusion detection;network self-protection","","0","","15","","","April 30 2007-May 3 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, modern mobile devices store PII for applications that span from email to SMS and from social media to location-based services increasing the concerns of the end user's privacy. Therefore, there is a clear need and expectation for PII data to be protected in the case of loss, theft, or capture of the portable device. In this paper, we present a novel FUSE (File system in User space) encryption file system to protect the removable and persistent storage on heterogeneous smart gadget devices running the Android platform. The proposed file system leverages NIST certified cryptographic algorithms to encrypt the data-at-rest. We present an analysis of the security and performance trade-offs in a wide-range of usage and load scenarios. Using existing known micro benchmarks in devices using encryption without any optimization, we show that encrypted operations can incur negligible overhead for read operations and up to twenty (20) times overhead for write operations for I/O-intensive programs. In addition, we quantified the database transaction performance and we observed a 50% operation time slowdown on average when using encryption. We further explore generic and device specific optimizations and gain 10% to 60% performance for different operations reducing the initial cost of encryption. Finally, we show that our approach is easy to install and configure across all Android platforms including mobile phones, tablets, and small notebooks without any user perceivable delay for most of the regular Android applications.","","978-1-4673-1796-2","978-0-7695-4713-8","10.1109/MDM.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341374","Encrypted filesystem;Full disk encryption;I/O performance;Smart handheld devices","Databases;Encryption;Kernel;Libraries;Smart phones","cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;input-output programs;smart phones;telecommunication security","Android;FUSE;I/O-intensive program;NIST certified cryptographic algorithm;PII data;SMS;data-at-rest;database transaction performance;email;encrypted operation;encryption filesystem;end user privacy;file system in user space;heterogeneous smart gadget device;location-based service;mobile device;personal identifiable information;read operation;security;smart handheld device;smart phone;social media;tablet;write operation","","5","","33","","","23-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to this, it is a challenging task today to the system administrators to provide secure email service. In this paper, security policy is defined at operating system level, mail application level and network infrastructure level. A policy at system level specifies mandatory usage profile, usages of system sensitive resources such as file system objects, processes, system memory and inter process communication objects. Policies for mail application are defined with sensitive files/directories and parameters, which have impact in delivering a service. Policies for network are defined for controlling inbound and outbound traffic, specifying demilitarized zone, denying misuse of public IP and detecting suspicious network activity. The proposed system architecture supports the layered approach in policy enforcement, proactive defensive mechanism against security violations and scope for new policy discovery.

As with any computer application, installation of a Trojan leaves a ldquofootprintrdquo on the systems resources. However, detection is non-trivial: the detector must be able to recognize the symptoms against a background of a range of other (ldquosaferdquo) activities, which also consume system resources. Furthermore, such detection activity should be at least resource neutral (in other words, the resources consumed by the detection process should not be more than the resources saved in detection). Therefore, we wished to explore the potential of an economical approach that explicitly takes into account resources used. In order to achieve our aim, we explore the possibility of making use of the existing widely deployed management information database (the MIB) as the basis for detecting attempts to install Trojan software on networked systems. We identify the characteristics of typical attacks in respect of the impact they have on particular MIB objects, and propose a decision-tree based algorithm which can detect Trojan activity.

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","978-1-4244-9211-4","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 19th Annual","20040108","2003","","","234","244","We present the design and implementation of a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) for accurate and efficient intrusion detection in a distributed system. CIDS employs multiple specialized detectors at the different layers - network, kernel and application - and a manager based framework for aggregating the alarms from the different detectors to provide a combined alarm for an intrusion. The premise is that a carefully designed and configured CIDS can increase the accuracy of detection compared to individual detectors, without a substantial degradation in performance. In order to validate the premise, we present the design and implementation of a CIDS which employs Snort, Libsafe, and a new kernel level IDS called Sysmon. The manager has a graph-based and a Bayesian network based aggregation method for combining the alarms to finally come up with a decision about the intrusion. The system is evaluated using a Web-based electronic store front application and under three different classes of attacks - buffer overflow, flooding and script-based attacks. The results show performance degradations compared to no detection of 3.9% and 6.3% under normal workload and a buffer overflow attack respectively. The experiments to evaluate the accuracy of the system show that the normal workload generates false alarms for Snort and the elementary detectors produce missed alarms. CIDS does not flag the false alarm and reduces the incidence of missed alarms to 1 of the 7 cases. CIDS can also be used to measure the propagation time of an intrusion which is useful in choosing an appropriate response strategy.","","0-7695-2041-3","","10.1109/CSAC.2003.1254328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254328","","Aggregates;Application software;Bayesian methods;Buffer overflow;Collaboration;Degradation;Detectors;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Kernel","Internet;belief networks;security of data","Bayesian network based aggregation method;Bayesian network based detection;Web-based electronic store;collaborative intrusion detection system;distributed system;event correlation;false alarms;graph-based aggregation method;missed alarms;specialized detectors","","12","","19","","","8-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WSN is very sensitive to various attacks, hence Security has become prominent issue in WSNs. Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attack is one of main concern for WSNs. DOS Attack diminishes the resources of sensor nodes which affect the normal functioning of the node. Media Access Control (MAC) layer is responsible for communication within multiple access networks and incorporates shared medium. Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media Access Control (FSMAC) Protocol gives good solution against DOS Attack. It detects all intrusion taking place and also decreases average energy consumed by the sensor network than in attacked scenario. These results are responsible for increase in the lifespan of a sensor network. Fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty for human reasoning and decision making. Innovational use of Fuzzy logic theory is applied to this FSMAC protocol to enhance the performance. Here in this paper, Reinvention in FSMAC protocol is proposed using new intrusion detector parameters like No of times node sensed channel free and Variation in channel sense period. Performance of new protocol is tested on the basis of time of first node dead and average energy consumed by the sensor node. These results show that the lifespan of sensor network increases and average energy consumed by sensor node decreases.","","","","10.1109/ICICICT.2014.6781305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781305","Denial-Of-Service (DOS) Attack;Fuzzy logic-optimized Secure Media access Control Protocol (FSMAC);Media Access Control (MAC) Protocol;Security Issues;Wireless Sensor Networks","Frequency division multiaccess;Indexes;Protocols;Receivers;Uncertainty;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;cryptographic protocols;decision making;energy consumption;fuzzy logic;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DOS attack;FSMAC protocol;WSN improvement;decision making;denial of service;energy consumption;fuzzy logic secure media access control protocol;human reasoning;intrusion detector parameter;multiple access networks;sensor nodes;uncertainty handling;wireless sensor network","","0","","17","","","7-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially it was used in intelligent dictionaries and spell check applications. Its ability for dynamic membership querying and information compaction attracted huge research. Various optimization models of bloom filter for diverse applications were suggested and hence many bloom filter variants emerged. Network security has become an important factor in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a new variant of bloom filter in which a standard cryptographic hash function whirlpool is modified into a non cryptographic form and deployed in the bloom filter to improve the network security. We also suggest a suitable mapping scheme. A cryptographic hash function is one which converts an input data of arbitrary length into a fixed-length output. Bloom Filters are hash based structures which have a certain degree of accuracy for considerable savings in memory and are used to support membership queries. Bloom Filters allow probability of False Positive Ratios and the aim of this paper is to reduce FPR by modifying the structure of bloom filter and enabling it to operate in the increasing network speed. The design has been implemented and tested using a Xilinx 65 nm field programmable gate array as the target technology and the results are compared with replacing the housing unit with widely used universal H3 hash function and also relatively compared with the other possible hash functions and bloom filters in literature. The performance matrices of the proposed design are false positive ratio and speed. The design is hardware based and suitable for networking and security querying applications.","","","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926138","Bloom filter;H3 hash function;compactness;counting bloom filter;cryptographic hash function field programmable array;false positive ratio;membership querying;parallel bloom Filter;standard bloom Filter;whirlpool hash function","Arrays;Cryptography;Hardware;Information filters;Radiation detectors;Standards","cryptography;data structures;dictionaries;field programmable gate arrays","Xilinx;arbitrary length;bloom filter variants;bloom filters;cryptographic hash function whirlpool;data structure technique;dynamic membership querying;false positive ratios;field programmable gate array;fixed-length output;hash based structures;information compaction;intelligent dictionary;mapping scheme;network security;networking application;noncryptographic form;performance matrix;security application;spell check application;target technology;universal H3 hash function;whirlpool hash based bloom filter","","0","","30","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on compressed HTTP traffic. HTTP uses GZIP compression and requires some kind of decompression phase before performing a string matching. We present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP (ACCH), that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern-matching algorithm. By analyzing real HTTP traffic and real Web application firewall signatures, we show that up to 84% of the data can be skipped in its scan. Surprisingly, we show that it is faster to perform pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than on regular traffic. As far as we know, we are the first paper that analyzes the problem of “on-the-fly” multipattern matching on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2172456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062397","Compressed HTTP;computer security;intrusion detection;pattern matching","Acceleration;Browsers;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Memory management;Pattern matching;Security","Internet;authorisation;computer network security;data compression;hypermedia;string matching;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","ACCH;Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for Compressed HTTP;GZIP compression;compressed HTTP traffic;data compression;decompression phase;market-share;multipattern matching acceleration;pattern matching;real Web application firewall signatures;security tools;signature-based detection;string matching","","3","","34","","2011-10-27","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The 27th Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE","20080502","2008","","","","","Pattern matching is one of the most important components for the content inspection based applications of network security, and it requires well designed algorithms and architectures to keep up with the increasing network speed. For most of the solutions, AC and its derivative algorithms are widely used. They are based on the DFA model but utilize large amount of memory because of so many transition rules. An algorithm, called ACC, is presented in this paper for multiple pattern matching. It uses a novel model, namely cached deterministic finite automate (CDFA). In ACC, by using CDFA, only 4.1% transition rules for ClamAV (20.8% for Snort) are needed to represent the same function using DFA built by AC. This paper also proposes a new scheme named next-state addressing (NSA) to store and access transition rules of DFA in memory. Using this method, transition rules can be efficiently stored and directly accessed. Finally the architecture for multiple pattern matching is optimized by several approaches. Experiments show our architecture can achieve matching speed faster than 10 Gbps with very efficient memory utilization, i.e., 81KB memory for 1.8 K Snort rules with total 29 K characters, and 9.5 MB memory for 50 K ClamAV rules with total 4.44 M characters. A single architecture is memory efficient for large pattern set, and it is possible to support more than 10 M patterns with at most half amount of the memory utilization compared to the state-of-the-art architectures.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509637","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Communications Society;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching","cache storage;computer networks;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;telecommunication security","ACC algorithm;cached deterministic finite automate;computer network security;content inspection based application;memory efficient multiple pattern matching architecture;next-state addressing scheme","","21","3","23","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By measuring the density of antibody in current system, the danger of network attack in the system can be captured correctly. A new network security evaluation method using antibody concentration to quantitatively analyze the degree of intrusion danger level is presented.

This opening, a prior beneficial, nevertheless raises a major problem: it ensues from it an increasing number of attacks. The IDS was developed with the aim of detecting abnormal functioning of information systems and networks, indicating that actions not corresponding to the safety policy are led by one or several users. Centralized IDS suffer from significant limitations when used in high speed networks, especially when they face distributed attacks. In this paper we propose a distributed hybrid approach based on mobile agents for the detection of intrusion: HAMA-IDS (Hybrid Approach based on Mobile Agents for Intrusion Detection System). The proposed approach uses the platform Aglets for the creation and the distribution of four types of mobile agents. The Collector agent is used to the gathering of information, when the Analyzer and Redirector agent are responsible of the analysis (scenarios and behavioral analysis). The generator agent is responsible to the launch of these agents and to the management of messages received from these last ones.","","978-1-4673-2226-3","","10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360647","Aglets;Mobile Agents;hybrid approach;intrusion detection system","Databases;Generators;Intrusion detection;Java;Mobile agents;Pattern matching","Internet;information systems;mobile agents;security of data","HAMA-IDS;Internet;aglets;analyzer agent;centralized IDS;collector agent;distributed attacks;distributed hybrid approach;generator agent;high speed networks;hybrid approach based on mobile agents for intrusion detection system;information systems;mobile agents;redirector agent;safety policy","","1","","16","","","1-3 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RE-NFA can be mapped directly onto a compact register-transistor level (RTL) circuit. A number of optimizations are applied to improve the circuit performance: 1) spatial stacking is used to construct an REM circuit processing m ≥ 1 input characters per clock cycle; 2) single-character constrained repetitions are matched efficiently by parallel shift-register lookup tables; 3) complex character classes are matched by a BRAM-based classifier shared across regexes; 4) a multipipeline architecture is used to organize a large number of RE-NFAs into priority groups to limit the I/O size of the circuit.

Attack graph is commonly used for analyzing network security level for its capability in reflecting all network vulnerabilities and their inter relationships. However, attack graph assumes an over pessimistic situation by giving the attacker unlimited power of exploiting each chain of vulnerabilities in the network, leading the complexity of analyzing to grow exponentially with the size of network.

In this paper, we investigate how attackers are planning to exploit vulnerabilities towards their targets and present the idea of a goal-oriented analysis of attack graph to address this problem.

"Towards feature subset selection in intrusion detection","Ahmad, I.; e Amin, F.","Dept. of Software Eng., King Saud Univ., Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence Conference (ITAIC), 2014 IEEE 7th Joint International","20150323","2014","","","68","73","Intrusion is a serious issue in computer and network systems because a single intrusion can cause a heavy loss in few seconds. To prevent an intrusion, a robust intrusion detection system is highly needed. Existing intrusion detection techniques are not robust; the number of false alarms is high. One of the reasons of false alarms is due to the use of a raw dataset that includes redundancy. To overcome this issue, the recent approaches used (PCA) for feature subset selection where features are first transformed into an eigen space and then features are selected based on their variances (i.e. eigenvalues), but the features corresponding to the highest eigenvalues may not have the optimal sensitivity for the classifier. Instead of using traditional approach of selecting features with the highest eigenvalues, an optimization approach is needed because the selection of most discriminative subset of transformed features is an optimization problem. One research used genetic algorithm (GA) to search the most discriminative subset of transformed features which is evolutionary optimization approach. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another optimization approach based on the behavioral study of animals/birds that outperforms GA in some applications. Therefore, the PSO based method is proposed in feature subset selection in this research work.","","978-1-4799-4420-0","","10.1109/ITAIC.2014.7065007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065007","Feature Selection;Genetic Algorithm (GA);Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO);Subset","Computers;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature selection;genetic algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;security of data","GA;PCA;PSO;computer systems;discriminative subset;eigenspace;eigenvalues;false alarms;feature subset selection;genetic algorithm;network systems;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;principal component analysis;robust intrusion detection system","","0","","20","","","20-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most penetration testing can hope for is to be the science of insecurity - not the science of security nasmuch as penetration testing can at most prove insecurity by falsifying the hypothesis that any system, network, or application is secure. To be a science of security would require falsifiable hypotheses that any given system, network, or application was insecure, something that could only be done if the number of potential insecurities were known and enumerated such that the penetration tester could thereby falsify (test) a known-to-be-complete list of vulnerabilities claimed to not be present. Because the list of potential insecurities is unknowable and hence unenumerable, no penetration tester can prove security, just as no doctor can prove that you are without occult disease. Putting it as Picasso did, ""Art is a lie that shows the truth"" and security by penetration testing is a lie in that on a good day can show the truth. These incompleteness and proof-by-demonstration characteristics of penetration testing ensure that it remains an art so long as high rates of technical advance remains brisk and hence enumeration of vulnerabilities an impossibility. Brisk technical advance equals productivity growth and thereby wealth creation, so it is forbidden to long for a day when penetration testing could achieve the status of science.","1063-9527","0-7695-1828-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2002.1176290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176290","","Art;Automation;Diseases;Fires;Performance evaluation;Productivity;Security;System testing;Terminology","computer testing;security of data","falsifiable hypotheses;insecurity;penetration testing;potential insecurities;security;vulnerabilities","","9","","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fingerprint scrubber restricts an attacker's ability to determine the operating system of a protected host. As an example, this paper presents the implementation of a TCP scrubber that eliminates insertion and evasion attacks - attacks that use ambiguities to subvert detection - on passive network-based intrusion detection systems, while preserving high performance.

At the same time, the number and complexity of the patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation of deep packet inspection architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e.g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).","","978-1-4244-2777-2","978-1-4244-2778-9","10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4636093","","Algorithm design and analysis;Character generation;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Proposals;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;formal languages;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","communication complexity;compressed deterministic finite automata;compressed nondeterministic finite automata;deep packet inspection architecture;high-performance regular expression pattern matching;high-speed content inspection;malicious network activity;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;programmable networking system","","19","1","28","","","14-16 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. CPS was identified as one of the eight research priority areas in the August 2007 report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as CPS will be the core component of many critical infrastructures and industrial control systems in the near future. However, a variety of random failures and cyber attacks exist in CPS, which greatly restrict their growth. Fortunately, an intrusion detection mechanism could take effect for protecting CPS. When a misbehavior is found by the intrusion detector, the appropriate action can be taken immediately so that any harm to the system will be minimized. As CPSs are yet to be defined universally, the application of the instruction detection mechanism remain open presently. As a result, the effort will be made to discuss how to appropriately apply the intrusion detection mechanism to CPS in this paper. By examining the unique properties of CPS, it intends to define the specific requirements first. Then, the design outline of the intrusion detection mechanism in CPS is introduced in terms of the layers of system and specific detection techniques.

We present hardware-implementable pattern matching algorithm for content filtering applications, which is scalable in terms of speed, the number of patterns and the pattern length. Our algorithm is based on a memory efficient multihashing data structure called Bloom filter. We use embedded on-chip memory blocks in field programmable gate array/very large scale integration chips to construct Bloom filters which can suppress a large fraction of memory accesses and speed up string matching. Based on this concept, we first present a simple algorithm which can scan for several thousand short (up to 16 bytes) patterns at multigigabit per second speeds with a moderately small amount of embedded memory and a few mega bytes of external memory. Furthermore, we modify this algorithm to be able to handle arbitrarily large strings at the cost of a little more on-chip memory.

They generally want to avoid honeypots since it is hard to spread attacks from them, attacks are thoroughly monitored on them, and some honeypots contain planted false information. This suggests that it could be useful for a computer system to pretend it is a honeypot, to scare away smarter attackers. We examine here from a number of perspectives how this could be accomplished as a kind of ""vaccination"" of systems to reduce numbers of attacks and their severity. We develop a mathematical model of what would make an attacker go away. We report experiments with deliberate distortions on text to see at what point people could detect deception, and discover they can respond to subtle clues. We also report experiments with real attackers against a honeypot of increasing obviousness. Results show that attacks on it decreased over time which may indicate that attackers are being scared away.

The decision rules are provided for both categorical and continuous features. By combining the weak classifiers for continuous features and the weak classifiers for categorical features into a strong classifier, the relations between these two different types of features are handled naturally, without any forced conversions between continuous and categorical features.

By arranging several sensors to deal with the traffic in parallel, the intrusion detection system's speed can be significantly increased. How to split the traffic to the sensors is the key problem of a parallel intrusion detection system. To resolve the problems, load balance has to be concerned. There is an emerging need for parallel intrusion detection techniques that can keep up with the increasing network throughput. A novel algorithm of load balance in the parallel IDS (intrusion detection system) was proposed to improve detection ability of parallel IDS. The algorithm was adopted to hash the network packet header information in data packet, to map the corresponding packet to the scope of the sensors' number, and to adjust the scope according to the performance and load of each sensor. Theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can dispatch data packets reasonably and utilize all the sensors' sources effectively.","","978-1-4244-3746-7","","10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731402","hash function;high availability;load balancing;parallel IDS","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Educational technology;Heuristic algorithms;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Round robin;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer networks;parallel processing;resource allocation;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","data packet;dynamic adaptive load balance algorithm;network packet header information;network throughput;network-based intrusion detection system;parallel intrusion detection system","","0","","9","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a TCP flow classifier that employs neither packet header information that is protocol-specific (including port numbers) nor packet-payload information. Techniques based on the former are readily evadable, while detailed yet scalable inspection of packet payloads is difficult to achieve, may violate privacy laws, and is defeated by data encryption. Our classifier is tested on two contemporary publicly available datasets recorded in similar networking contexts. We consider the often encountered scenario where ground-truth labels, necessary for supervised classifier training, are unavailable for a domain where flow classification needs to be applied. In this case, one must ""port over"" a classifier trained on one domain to make decisions on another. We address issues in reconciling differences in class definitions between the two domains. We also demonstrate by our results that domain differences in the class-conditional feature distributions, which will exist in practice, can lead to substantial losses in classification accuracy on the new domain.

In particular, we focus on mechanisms that enable efficient key management for SAN entities and allow scalable data sharing. We use strong cryptographic techniques to achieve data security and integrity. Further, we delegate the bulk of the cryptographic processing to the SAN entities, thereby removing bottlenecks at disks and causing minimal inconvenience to hosts.

DT highlights the importance of the tissue and states that antigen presentation must be coupled with its tissue conditions. In order to create a contextually aware IDS with the incorporation of the concept of tissue, a novel algorithm to grow tissue is presented which adopts the theory of data fields in physics. This algorithm has the ability to dynamically cluster antigen data and provides a useful measure to danger signal.

The modern commodity platforms equipped with processors rich in number of cores and having hyper threading technology has enabled emergence of software based solutions rather than dedicated platforms for traffic analysis. But the general purpose network stacks provided by operating systems focus more on compatibility and hence are not able to fully exploit the hardware capabilities of these platforms. Lot of work is reported on customizing the stack for packet capture and achieving line rate (10 Gbps) performance on a single Network Interface Card (NIC). Some work is also reported on use of multiple 10GbE NICs for handling traffic beyond 10 Gbps. This paper brings out through experimental setup and observations the issues involved in linear scaling of performance with additional NICs on commodity Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) servers. It shows that linear scaling requires optimum configurations of compute, memory and network resources especially affinity of NICs to NUMA nodes. Using these configurations we are able to achieve linear scaling of traffic analysis capability with additional 10 GbE NICs. We report scaled performance upto 40 Gbps with the use of four NIC cards.","","978-1-4799-6870-1","","10.1109/ICDSE.2014.6974636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974636","Commodity Servers;Linear Scaling;Multiple NICs;Traffic Capture;beyond 10 Gbps","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Hardware;Program processors;Servers","network interfaces;telecommunication traffic","Internet users;NIC;NUMA nodes;commodity NUMA servers;commodity nonuniform memory access servers;compute resource;general purpose network stacks;hyper threading technology;line rate performance;linear performance scaling;memory resource;multiple network interface cards;network resource;network traffic rate;operating systems;optimum configurations;packet capture;single network interface card;software based solutions;traffic analysis capability;traffic capture","","0","","13","","","26-28 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Negative Selection Algorithms (NSA) is one of the most popular models of AIS mainly designed for one-class learning problems such as anomaly detection [1]. Positive Selection Algorithms (PSA) is the twin brother of NSA with similar performance for AIS [2]. Both NSAs and PSAs comprise of two phases: generating a set D of detectors from a given set S of selves (detector generation phase); and then detecting if a given cell (new data instance) is self or non-self using the generated detector set (detection phase). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combining NSAs and PSAs that employ binary representation and r-chunk matching rule.

This paper presents quantitative evaluations of false positives and their impact on monitoring based intrusion detection for ad hoc networks. Experimental results show that even for a simple 3-node configuration, an actual ad hoc network suffers from high false positives; these results are validated by a Markov model. However, this false positive problem cannot be observed by simulating the same network using popular ad hoc network simulators such as ns- 2, OPNET or Glomosim with default noise models. To remedy this, a probabilistic noise generator model is incorporated in the Glomosim simulator. With this revised noise model, the simulated network exhibits the aggregate false positive behavior similar to that of the experimental testbed. Simulations of larger (50- node) ad hoc networks indicate that a monitoring based intrusion detection has very high false positives which impact its ability to mitigate the attacks.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-2324-8","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698177","","Ad hoc networks;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Mobile ad hoc networks;Noise level;Power system security;Testing;Working environment noise","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;noise generators","Markov model;data forwarding;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;probabilistic noise generator","","1","","11","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Counterattack agent as antibody, is built in each regular node which is regarded as B-cell. When Detection agents find invaders, they send out instructions to activate the counterattack agents in the neighbor nodes of the invaders.

First, original training dataset gained from network is divided into three subsets according to the network protocol (TCP, UDP and ICMP). Second, every subset is parted into multi-subsets and sent to parallel SVMs. Then we get multiple results from SVM trainers. The incremental learning algorithm of SVM is used to train new data sets instead of reconstructing SVM for whole data. This method improves the training efficiency by reducing the size of training subsets. At last, simulation experiments are done with KDD CUP 1999 data set. The experiment results show that the training time of SVM is shortened and the detection accuracy obtained by our method is exactly same as that obtained by others.","","978-1-4244-5227-9","978-1-4244-5228-6","10.1109/JCPC.2009.5420129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5420129","","Data security;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Parallel algorithms;Pervasive computing;Protocols;Support vector machines;Ubiquitous computing","groupware;parallel algorithms;protocols;security of data;support vector machines;ubiquitous computing","cooperative intrusion detection system;high speed network;large scale network;learning algorithm;network protocol;parallel SVM;pervasive computing;support vector machine","","0","","7","","","3-5 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a new approach to intrusion detection in computer networks based on the use of neural networks ensembles. This approach can be implemented in distributed intrusion detection systems (IDS) which better meets the challenges of the present time, in contrast to the traditional use of neural networks in host-based IDS. In the paper the basic steps of the neural networks ensembles designing are described and some of the methods to complete these steps are expounded. Peculiarities of using neural networks ensembles to solve classification problems are discussed. Then the basic scheme of neural networks ensemble approach to intrusion detection systems is proposed. Conditions and results of the experimental investigation of the proposed approach on a number of classification problems are presented, including the problem of classifying probe attacks.

The proposed algorithm uses software bitmap for each multi-pattern signature without hardware changes, which maximizes flexibility of content processor. From the analysis of Snort which is the widely used intrusion detection system, we observe spatial locality between distances of patterns in the multi-pattern signature.

Much work has been done in this field; however, most of the prior work results in low memory efficiency (defined as the ratio of the amount of the required storage in bytes and the size of the dictionary in number of characters). Due to such inefficiency, state-of-the-art designs cannot support large dictionaries without using high-latency external DRAM. We propose an algorithm called ""leaf-attaching"" to preprocess a given dictionary without increasing the number of patterns. The resulting set of postprocessed patterns can be searched using any tree-search data structure. We also present a scalable, high-throughput, Memory-efficient Architecture for large-scale String Matching (MASM) based on a pipelined binary search tree. The proposed algorithm and architecture achieve a memory efficiency of 0.56 (for the Rogets dictionary) and 1.32 (for the Snort dictionary). As a result, our design scales well to support larger dictionaries. Implementations on 45 nm ASIC and a state-of-the-art FPGA device (for latest Rogets and Snort dictionaries) show that our architecture achieves 24 and 3.2 Gbps, respectively. The MASM module can simply be duplicated to accept multiple characters per cycle, leading to scalable throughput with respect to the number of characters processed in each cycle. Dictionary update involves simply rewriting the content of the memory, which can be done quickly without reconfiguring the chip.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148214","ASIC;Aho-Corasick;DFA;Databases;Dictionaries;Memory management;Pattern matching;Rogets;Snort;String matching;Throughput;Vectors;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);leaf attaching;pipeline;reconfigurable","Databases;Dictionaries;Memory management;Pattern matching;Throughput;Vectors","Internet;application specific integrated circuits;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;storage management;string matching;tree searching","ASIC;FPGA device;MASM module;NIDS;Rogets dictionary;Snort dictionary;characters per cycle;content matching;dictionary dictionary;dictionary preprocessing;dictionary update;high-latency external DRAM;large-scale string pattern matching;leaf-attaching;malicious pattern dictionary;memory content rewriting;modular approach;network intrusion detection systems;network traffic;pipelined binary search tree;predefined database;scalable high-throughput memory-efficient architecture;tree-search data structure","","1","","19","","2012-02-07","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In flat topology, the nodes relay every data item collected by each node towards the gateway node, thereby draining the energy of the relaying nodes soon. In a WSN application, it may not be possible to replace the batteries always. One of the basic requirements of any WSN application is energy conservation of the nodes.
