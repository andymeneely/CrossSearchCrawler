The fundamental reason for their success in NID is their ability to learn normal behavior of a network system and then differentiate it from an anomalous behavior. As a result, they can detect a majority of innovative attacks. In comparison, classical signature based systems fail to detect innovative attacks. Light Weight Intrusion Detection System (LISYS) provides the basic framework for AIS based NID systems. This framework has been improved incrementally, including incorporation of thymus action, since it was first developed. In this paper, we have extended the basic thymus action model, which provides immature detectors with multiple chances to develop tolerization to normal. However, AIS is prone to successful attacks by malicious traffic which appears similar to the normal traffic. This results in high number of false positives. In this paper, we present a mathematical model of malicious traffic for TCP-SYN flood based distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. This model is used to generate different sets of malicious traffic. These sets are used for performance comparison of the proposed extended thymus action with the simple thymus action model. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the extended model has significantly reduced the number of false positives.","","978-1-4244-1339-3","978-1-4244-1340-9","10.1109/CEC.2007.4424907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4424907","","Artificial immune systems;Detectors;Floods;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Libraries;Mathematical model;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","artificial immune systems;security of data","artificial immune systems;distributed denial of services attacks;extended thymus action;light weight intrusion detection system;malicious traffic;network intrusion detection;network system","","1","3","22","","","25-28 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Eng., Miami Univ., Coral Gables, FL, USA","Multimedia, Seventh IEEE International Symposium on","20060103","2005","","","6 pp.","","In this paper, a secure and adaptive multimedia transmission framework is proposed to maintain the quality of service (QoS) of the multimedia streams during the denial-of service (DoS) attacks. A DoS attack generates a large amount of traffic, which will occupy the bandwidth and degrade the quality of video. The proposed framework consists of two components: intrusion detection and adaptive transmission management. The intrusion detection component monitors the incoming traffic to the server, detects the attacks, and interacts with the adaptive transmission management component; while the adaptive transmission management component is designed to improve QoS of the video via the efficient utilization of the network resources. With the detection of the DoS attacks, the bandwidth occupied by the attacks can be reduced and protected for video transmission. The results of our preliminary simulations in NS2 show that the quality of the multimedia stream can still be maintained during an attack.","","0-7695-2489-3","","10.1109/ISM.2005.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1565903","","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Degradation;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Protection;Quality of service;Resource management;Streaming media;Telecommunication traffic","multimedia communication;quality of service;security of data;telecommunication security;video streaming","DoS attacks;QoS protection;adaptive multimedia transmission;adaptive transmission management;denial of service attacks;intrusion detection;multimedia streams;quality of service;video transmission","","1","1","12","","","12-14 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bus-based CAN does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus-based CAN are alarming, because safety-critical subsystems (e.g., the power train) often deploy a CAN bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus-based CAN systems. The CAN router establishes a partitioning of a CAN bus into separate CAN segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the CAN system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the CAN router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus-based CAN, but are detected and contained on router-based CAN. The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e.g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the CAN router offers ports that are compatible to standard CAN, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy CAN based systems.","","978-1-4673-2685-8","978-1-4673-2683-4","10.1109/SIES.2012.6356590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6356590","","Automotive engineering;Multicast communication;Routing;Security;Software;Topology","computer network security;controller area networks;software maintenance","CAN router;CAN systems security;automotive applications;automotive domain;bus-based CAN;controller area network;denial-of-service attacks;eavesdropping;failure propagation;legacy CAN based systems;message fabrication;power train;router-based CAN;safety domain;safety-critical subsystems;star coupling router;trust model","","2","","24","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Classification of Disturbances and Cyber-Attacks in Power Systems Using Heterogeneous Time-Synchronized Data","Shengyi Pan; Morris, T.; Adhikari, U.","Mississippi State Univ., Starkville, MS, USA","Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on","20150602","2015","11","3","650","662","Visualization and situational awareness are of vital importance for power systems, as the earlier a power-system event such as a transmission line fault or cyber-attack is identified, the quicker operators can react to avoid unnecessary loss. Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2015.2420951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081776","Common Paths;Common paths;Cyber-attack Detection;Disturbances;Symmetric and Unsymmetrical Faults;Synchrophasor Data and Device Log Mining;cyber-attack detection;disturbances;symmetric and unsymmetrical faults;synchrophasor data and device log mining","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Monitoring;Power systems;Relays;Sensors;Transmission line measurements","data mining;pattern classification;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;sensor fusion","classification;common path;critical system states;heterogeneous synchrophasor data;heterogeneous time-synchronized data;network event monitor logs;path-mining algorithm;pattern extraction;power system cyber-attacks;power system disturbances;relay logs;sequential pattern mining approach;synchrophasor measurements;system logs","","0","","34","","2015-04-08","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most existing approaches have focused on intrusion detection and post-attack responses in a similar fashion to fault detection and recovery. However, attack behaviors are much more complex and less predictable than fault behaviors as an attacker often changes his course of actions during the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach that can incorporate behaviors of attackers into the decision analysis of security management. This is especially crucial as attackers can keep advancing their techniques to outsmart security technologies. Our research aims to enhance the science of security that enables behavioral modeling as well as model extensibility. In particular, we present an analytical game theoretic approach to analyzing security of smart grid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems by including attacker/defender behaviors in the proposed sequential, non-zero sum, and two-player game model. The paper describes the development of the game payoffs and illustrates how informed decisions can be made on a real-world scenario of attacks at the sensor level of the smart grid SCADA systems.","","","","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007770","Game theory;SCADA;SCADA security;Sequential games;payoffs;utility function","Conferences;Game theory;Games;Monitoring;SCADA systems;Security;Smart grids","SCADA systems;decision theory;fault diagnosis;game theory;power system faults;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","behavioral modeling;cyber attack game analysis;decision analysis;fault detection;fault recovery;game payoffs development;informed decision derivation;intrusion detection;model extensibility;nonzero sum game model;post-attack response;security management;sequential game model;smart grid SCADA system security;smart grid protection;supervisory control-and-data acquisition;two-player game model","","0","","15","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of monitoring the ongoing traffic at the front end (like firewall or proxy) or a victim server itself, we detect the SYN flooding attacks at leaf routers that connect end hosts to the Internet. The simplicity of our detection mechanism lies in its statelessness and low computation overhead, which make the detection mechanism itself immune to flooding attacks. Our detection mechanism is based on the protocol behavior of TCP SYN-FIN (RST) pairs, and is an instance of the Seqnential Change Point Detection [l]. To make the detection mecbanism insensitive to site and access pattern, a non-parametric Cnmnlative Sum (CUSUM) method [4] is applied, thus making the detection mechanism much more generally applicable and its deployment much easier. The efficacy of this detection mechanism is validated by trace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that the detection mechanism has short detection latency and high detection accuracy. Moreover, due to its proximity to the flooding sources, our mechanism not only sets alarms upon detection of ongoing SYN flooding attacks, but also reveals the location of the flooding sources without resorting to expensive IP traceback.","0743-166X","0-7803-7476-2","","10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1019404","","Access protocols;Computer crime;Delay;Floods;IP networks;Monitoring;Network servers;Robustness;Web and internet services;Web server","","","","86","7","35","","","23-27 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show through simulation that the AKS scheme can greatly improve the connectivity and security of the existing multiple deployment scheme in wireless sensor networks.","","978-0-7695-2943-1","","10.1109/NPC.2007.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4351510","","Authentication;Base stations;Communication system security;Computer science;Cryptography;Data security;Educational institutions;Network servers;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","adaptive key selection scheme;multiple deployment scheme;security functionality;wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","18-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A set of rules are used by Signature based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect hostile traffic in network segments or packets, which are so important in detecting malicious and anomalous behavior over the network like known attacks that hackers look for new techniques to go unseen. Sometime, a single failure at any layer will cause the NIDS to miss that attack. To overcome this problem, a technique is used that will trigger a failure in that layer. Such technique is known as Evasive technique. An Evasion can be defined as any technique that modifies a visible attack into any other form in order to stay away from being detect. The proposed system is used for detecting attacks which are going on the network and also gives actual categorization of attacks. The proposed system has advantage of getting low false alarm rate and high detection rate. So that leads into decrease in complexity and overhead on the system. The paper presents the Evasion technique for customized apriori algorithm. The paper aims to make a new functional structure to evade NIDS. This framework can be used to audit NIDS. This framework shows that a proof of concept showing how to evade a self-built NIDS considering two publicly available datasets.","","978-1-4799-8083-3","","10.1109/ICIT.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033353","Evasion;Intrusion detection;Network intrusion detection system;Network security","Classification algorithms;Computers;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring","computer crime;computer network security","actual attack categorization;anomalous behavior;customized apriori algorithm;evade network intrusion detection system;evasion technique;hackers;hardware tool;hostile traffic;malicious behavior;modified apriori approach;network packets;network segments;self-built NIDS;software tool;visible attack","","0","","11","","","22-24 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Flooding DDoS attacks produce adverse effects for critical infrastructure availability, integrity and confidentiality. Current defense approaches cannot efficiently detect and filter out the attack traffic in real time. Online analysis of real time attack traffic and their impact and degradation of host and network based performance metrics becomes very essential. So, online measurement of these network performance metrics itself acts as an Intrusion detection system. The anomalies are the inference for network security analyst to suspect whether the network is under attack or not. Based on the assumption that the attacker flows are very aggressive than the legitimate users the proposed work provides sufficient bandwidth to genuine users during flooding DDoS attack. The Interface Based Rate Limiting (IBRL) algorithm proposed in this paper is used to mitigate the identified DDoS attacks. The implementation is carried out on an experimental testbed build up on Linux machines and Virtual routers. The experimental results show that there is considerable increase in the host and network based performance metrics for legitimate users even under DoS and DDoS attacks.","","978-1-4673-1599-9","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206744","Distributed Denial of Service attack;host and network based performance metrics;rate limiting;virtual router","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Internet;Limiting;Measurement;Monitoring;Throughput","Linux;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attack;DDoS detection;IBRL;Linux machines;critical infrastructure availability;critical infrastructure confidentiality;critical infrastructure integrity;cyber society;distributed denial of service attacks;experimental testbed;host-network based metrics;host-network based mitigation;interface based rate limiting algorithm;network performance metrics online measurement;real time attack traffic online analysis;virtual routers","","3","","15","","","19-21 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of them scarcely try to combine the two issues together to propose an integrated solution, which is employed to defend the pivotal data and to recover the data when the intrusion has taken place. In this paper, we propose a framework of intrusion detection/recovery system (IDRS). This system is capable of detecting the intrusion on the file-level and recovering data on the block-level. Its advantages include that the file-level detection simplifies the implementation and the recovery based on the block-level can decrease the recovery time and raise the utilization ratio of storage devices. Again, considering that iSCSI has increasingly played an important role in network storage systems, we implement the IDRS prototype based on this promising protocol. The result of tests shows the extra storage overheads, arising from IDRS, are small (less than 10%). Therefore, we believe it is feasible to deploy IRDS on iSCSI systems to protect key files from damage.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529401","","Availability;Data engineering;Data security;Information science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;National security;Protection;Protocols","digital storage;file organisation;security of data","IDRS;block-level data recovery;file-level intrusion detection;iSCSI;network storage systems","","1","","16","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","0196-2892","","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717732","Feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms (GAs);hyperspectral image classification;sparseness;support vector machines (SVMs)","Genetics;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Kernel;Minimization methods;Remote sensing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectroscopy;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;image classification;multidimensional signal processing;remote sensing;support vector machines","feature detection;feature selection;generalization bounds;genetic algorithms;genetic optimization framework;hyperspectral remote sensing images;optimal SVM classification;radius margin bound minimization;recursive feature elimination;simple support vector count;sparseness;support vector machine","","91","1","46","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The majority of the research focuses on developing algorithms or signatures for detecting polymorphic and metamorphic payloads. However much of this problem has already been solved through the mainstream use of host based protection mechanisms e.g. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Randomization (ASLR). Many hackers are now using the more inventive attack methods e.g., return-to-libc, which do not inject shell code onto the stack and thus evade DEP and common shell code detection mechanisms. The purpose of this work is to propose a series of generic signatures that could be used to detect network born return-to-libc attacks.

Therefore, packet analysis systems examine network traffic to detect active botnets and spreading worms. However, with the advent of multi-gigabit link speeds, capturing and analysing header and payload of every packet requires enormous amounts of computational resources and is therefore not feasible in many situations. We address this problem by presenting an efficient packet sampling algorithm that picks a small number of packets from the beginning of every TCP connection. Bloom filters are used to store the required connection state information with constant amount of memory. Our analysis of worm and botnet traffic shows that the large majority of attack signatures is actually found in these packets. Thus, our sampling algorithm can be deployed in front of a detection system to reduce the amount of inspected packets without degrading the detection results significantly.","1542-1201","978-1-4244-5366-5","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488473","","Filters;Forensics;High-speed networks;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Out of order;Payloads;Runtime;Sampling methods;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;sampling methods","Bloom filters;TCP connections;botnet detection;malware;network security;packet sampling;sampling algorithm;worm detection","","5","","25","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since conventional software-based algorithms for string matching have not kept pace with high network speeds, specialized high-speed, hardware-based solutions are needed. We describe a technique based on Bloom filters for detecting predefined signatures (a string of bytes) in the packet payload. A Bloom filter is a data structure for representing a set of strings in order to support membership queries. We use hardware Bloom filters to isolate all packets that potentially contain predefined signatures. Another independent process eliminates false positives produced by Bloom filters. We outline our approach for string matching at line speeds and present a performance analysis. Finally, we report the results for a prototype implementation of this system on the FPX platform.

However, if end users administer their own machines, nothing stops dishonest ones from marking undeserving traffic for high QoS.

Their perceived success has led to the development of similar approaches in cyber security; information about previous attacks can be used to identify wider vulnerabilities and to inform future threat assessments. However, it can be difficult to integrate safety and security reporting within a single system. For example, in safety reporting systems the aim is often to disseminate lessons as widely as possible. In cyber security, there is a concern that this might motivate and inform further attacks. This paper identifies the challenges that arise in developing reporting schemes for security incidents in safety-critical applications. In particular we focus on the problems of implementing intrusion detection systems and coordinating forensic analysis without undermining system safety. These problems are exacerbated because existing cyber-security reporting guidelines focus more on office based systems than complex, command and control applications.","","978-1-84919-940-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111733","Cyber-Security;Forensics;Incident Reporting;Intrusion Detection Systems;Safety-Critical Systems","","digital forensics;safety-critical software","Cyber attack;Cyber-security incidents;coordinating forensic analysis;information vulnerabilities;intrusion detection systems;office based systems;reporting scheme;safety management systems;safety-critical systems;security incidents;threat assessment","","0","","","","","15-16 Oct. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the IEEE International","20051107","2005","","","188","196","Network intrusion detection is becoming an increasingly important tool to protect critical information and infrastructure from unauthorized access. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are commonly based on general-purpose workstations connected to a network tap. However, these general-purpose systems, although cost-efficient, are not able to sustain the packet rates of modern high-speed networks. The resulting packet loss degrades the system's overall effectiveness, since attackers can intentionally overload the NIDS to evade detection. This paper studies the performance requirements of a commonly used open-source NIDS on a modern workstation architecture. Using full-system simulation, this paper characterizes the impact of a number of system-level optimizations and architectural trends on packet loss, and highlights the key bottlenecks for this type of network-intensive workloads. Results suggest that interrupt aggregation combined with rule set pruning is most effective in minimizing packet loss. Surprisingly, the workload also exhibits sufficient locality to benefit from larger level-2 caches as well.

Code generation is a technique used to convert data structures or instruction to other forms to obtain greater benefits within execution environments. This study analyzes intrusion detection system (IDS) signatures and discovers character occurrence to be significantly uneven. Based on this property, this study designs a method to generate a string matching source code according to the state table of AC algorithm for embedded network intrusion detection platforms. The generated source code requires less memory and relies not only on table lookup, but also on the ability of processor. This method can upgrade the performance by compiling optimization and contribute to the application of network processors and DSP-like based platforms. From evaluation, this method requires use of only 20% memory and can achieve 86% performance in clean traffic compared to the original Aho-Corasick algorithm (AC).","","978-1-4799-1983-3","","10.1109/ICCSN.2015.7296134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296134","Code Generation;Intrusion Detection System;String Matching","Arrays;Intrusion detection;Memory management;Optimization;Switches;Table lookup;Thyristors","computer network security;digital signatures;program compilers;string matching","AC algorithm;DSP-like based platforms;character occurrence discovery;data structures;embedded network intrusion detection platforms;intrusion detection system signatures;intrusion-signature matching;network security systems;optimization compilation;processor ability;retargetable multiple string matching code generation;table lookup","","","","","","","6-7 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are centralized in nature where a central node collects data from every node and detects whether any abnormal activity is taking place in the network. In our research we propose to use intelligent mobile agents to detect intrusions in a network. An agent is a piece of program which will execute specified operations on a node in a network. The agents act as guards which essentially roam the network periodically to check whether any node in the network is under attack. When an agent visits a node, it scans the log file to identify any abnormal activity taking place in that node. In our previous research we proposed algorithms for finding initial locations and roaming pattern of agents. In this research, we have built the prototype of an agent and deployed it in a virtual network to test its performance by simulating intrusions. We have also tested the performance of the prototype by deploying the agents on PlanetLab which is a testbed in the Internet connecting more than 1300 machines all over the world. From our experiments we have observed that the performance of the agent based intrusion detection system depends on the size and topology of the network.","","","","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166574","agents;intrusion detection;networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Intrusion detection;Magnetic heads;Network topology;Prototypes;Topology","Internet;mobile agents;security of data","IDSs;Internet;PlanetLab;agent deployment;agent roaming pattern;central node;intelligent mobile agents;intrusion detection system;network size;network topology;virtual network","","0","","7","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pattern match algorithm plays an important role in NIDS that performs searches against multiple patterns for a string match. Pattern matching is a computationally expensive task. Traditional software-based NIDS solutions usually can not achieve a high-speed required for ever growing Internet attacks. In order to satisfy high-speed packet content inspection, hardware-implementable pattern match algorithm is required. In this paper, we propose a hardware-based pattern match architecture that employs a multi-character processor array. The proposed multi-character processor array is a parallel and pipelined architecture which can process multiple characters of the input stream per cycle. The proposed architecture can reduce a lot of unnecessary computations and thus it is power efficient. We use snort pattern sets and DEFCON packet traces to perform our simulations.

Our solution is based upon several security levels, event based model, and a simple computational abstraction where an anomaly detection technique is designed to monitor the users' registrations to the operational targeted system, e.g., UNIX-like implementation. In our model, the events' generation model is processed using the Unix Syslog-ng tool, the events' analysis using the Logcheck tool, while the activities of the users and the execution of the both reactive and pro-active events' activities are implemented within an artificial immune and mobile agent based infrastructure.

Existing host based intrusion detection systems detects the intrusion using complete feature set and it is not fast enough to detect the attacks. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an efficient HIDS - Correlation based Partial Decision Tree Algorithm (CPDT). The proposed CPDT combines Correlation feature selection for selecting features and Partial Decision Tree (PART) for classifying the normal and the abnormal packets. The algorithm is implemented and has been validated within KDD'99 dataset and found to give better results than the existing algorithms. The proposed CPDT model provides the accuracy of 99.9458%.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996115","CFS;DoS;IDS;Intruder;Probing;R2L;U2R","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Correlation;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection","computer network security;data mining;decision trees;feature selection;pattern classification;security of data","CPDT algorithm;DoS attack;HIDS;Internet service operation;KDD'99 dataset;PART;Probing attack;R2L attack;U2R attack;abnormal packet classification;correlation feature selection;correlation feature selection algorithm;correlation-based partial decision tree algorithm;host system;host-based intrusion detection system;network systems;normal packet classification;system security","","0","","16","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Port scanning detection has received a lot of attention by researchers. However a slow port scan attack can deceive most of the existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this paper, we present a new, simple, and efficient method for detecting slow port scans. Our proposed method is mainly composed of two phases: (1) a feature collection phase that analyzes network traffic and extracts the features needed to classify a certain IP as malicious or not. (2) A classification phase that divides the IPs, based on the collected features, into three groups: normal IPs, suspicious IPs and scanner IPs. The IPs our approach classify as suspicious are kept for the next (K) time windows for further examination to decide whether they represent scanners or legitimate users. Hence, this approach is different than the traditional approach used by IDSs that classifies IPs as either legitimate or scanners, and thus producing a high number of false positives and false negatives. A small Local Area Network was put together to test our proposed method. The experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method in correctly identifying malicious scanners when both normal and slow port scan were performed using the three most common TCP port scanning techniques. Moreover, our method detects malicious scanners that are otherwise not detected using well known IDSs such as Snort.","","978-1-4577-2154-0","","10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6122824","Intrusion Detection System;Port Scanning","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;IP networks;Probes;Security;Servers;Training data","local area networks;security of data;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","IDS;TCP port scanning techniques;feature collection phase;intrusion detection systems;local area network;reconnaissance technique attackers;slow port scanning detection","","3","","20","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For classification, we use a maximum log-likelihood approach, which works well for comparably small training and test set sizes. We also show to which degree a specific VM can be recognized, regardless of other VMs currently running on the same server, and show false negative/positive rates. To cross-validate our results, we have used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, resulting in comparable quality of recognition within shorter time. In order to clarify whether our approach is generalizable and yields reproducible results, we have set up a second experimental infrastructure in Lyon, using a different hardware platform and power measurement device. We have obtained similar results and have experimented with different CPU frequency scaling governors, yielding comparable quality of recognition.

IEEE International Symposium on","20091228","2009","","","1","10","An emerging class of applications for enterprise wireless LANs (WLAN) is voice over IP (VoIP) applications, which impose a stringent requirement on end-to-end delay. Because access points on an enterprise WLAN tend to be associated with different IP subnets, support for network-layer handoff is indispensable. Moreover, the handoff frequency is expected to be much higher for WLANs than for cellular networks because the coverage of a WLAN access point is much smaller. Although mobile IP is a mature solution to the network-layer handoff problem, no known mobile IP implementation on IEEE 802.11 WLANs can reduce the handoff latency below 100 msec, a nominal requirement for VoIP applications. This paper describes a novel Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture that completely does away with network-layer handoff, and thus reduces the end-to-end handoff delay to that of link-layer handoff, which is supported by WLAN hardware directly. In addition, the proposed wireless overlay network (WON) architecture, which has been implemented in a commercial WLAN access point, represents the first mobility solution that allows a mobile device to maintain its network connections while roaming across different IP subnets without requiring any modification on the mobile device. As a result, the proposed architecture can automatically provide seamless network-layer handoff to a wide variety of mobile devices (such as PDA, portable, cell phone) running on different operating systems, as long as they are equipped with 802.11 network interface.","1526-7539","978-1-4244-4927-9","978-1-4244-4928-6","10.1109/MASCOT.2009.5366648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366648","","Cellular phones;Delay;Frequency;Hardware;Internet telephony;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Network interfaces;Operating systems;Roaming;Wireless LAN","IP networks;Internet telephony;cellular radio;mobile computing;wireless LAN","Ethernet-over-IP overlay network architecture;IEEE 802.11 WLAN;PDA;cell phone;cellular networks;device-transparent network-layer handoff;enterprise wireless LAN;micromobility;mobile IP;mobile devices;voice over IP;wireless overlay network","","0","1","18","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accordingly, a variable data classification index has been defined and presented in this paper to classify stored data in cloud servers dynamically and increase the efficiency of this process. The suggested index uses three main parameters (Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, and Data Availability) and several sub-parameters to determine the value of this index dynamically according to the specifications of stored data.

However, local monitoring as presented in the literature is vulnerable to an attack called <i>misrouting</i> <i>attack</i>. Packet misrouting disrupts the packet from reaching the destination by malicious behavior at an intermediate node. However, the malicious node gives the impression to its neighbors that it performed the legitimate forwarding action. Moreover, a legitimate node comes under suspicion. I provide a protocol called MlMl based on local monitoring to remedy the attack. It requires the neighbors to maintain additional information about the routing path.

To achieve high throughput, multiple regular expressions are combined and compiled into one DFA, which leads to two problems: a) State explosion; b) Sub-rule distinguishing in the combined rule set. While the first problem has been extensively studied in the recent years, we did not find any literature which formally discusses the second problem in detail. We formulate it and propose sub-rule distinguishable DFA (SRD-DFA), an extended DFA structure, and develop techniques to distinguish sub-rules from multiple regular expressions upon this structure. SRD-DFA can achieve the same throughput as minimized DFA, since it only incurs little extra memory consumption without extra run-time computation. Experimental results under the L7-filter rule set and a subset of Snort rule set demonstrate that our approach achieves 8 to 14 times higher throughput than the DFA without rule combination, while only introducing less than 8.4% overhead of state increase compared to the minimized DFA after rule combination. SRD-DFA can be easily used with advanced DFA compression algorithms to achieve much less memory consumption.","","978-0-7695-3929-4","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380614","DFA;Minimization;Regular Expression","Automata;Computer science;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Explosions;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Power engineering and energy;Throughput","data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata","DFA compression algorithms;L7-filter rule set;Snort rule set;advanced DFA compression algorithms;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;extended DFA structure;memory consumption;packet payload;subrule distinguishable DFA","","2","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An attack could consist of a large number of packet streams generated by many compromised slaves that consume resources associated with various network elements to deny normal services or a few offending packets to disable a system. Several techniques based on probabilistic samples of transit packets have been developed, to determine the sources of large packet flows. It seems that logging of packet digests is necessary for traceback of an individual packet. A clever technique based on Bloom filters has recently been proposed to generate the audit trails for each individual packet within the network. The scheme is effective. However, the storage requirement is approximately 0.5% of the link capacity, which becomes a problem as link capacity increases. In this paper, we propose packet digesting schemes for flows and sets of packets sharing the same source and destination addresses. Compared with the individual packet digesting scheme, these schemes can achieve similar goals and are much more scalable.

Through deeply investigating the theory of control flow security, we develop the Control Flow Security Model (CFSM) which includes the formal definitions for program semantics and security properties for control flow. CFSM specifies that program execution dynamically follows only certain paths, in accordance with a statically declared security properties specified as Control Flow Constraint Specification (CFCS). We have proposed an efficient control flow security analysis algorithm for verifying that a particular control flow model satisfies the associated security properties. Our work contributes to bridging the gap between abstract specifications of control flow security properties and actual control flow security analysis for binary executables. The effectiveness and the practical usefulness of the approach are exemplified by an illustrative analysis of heap overflow vulnerability.","","978-1-4244-4519-6","978-1-4244-4520-2","10.1109/ICCSIT.2009.5234950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5234950","control flow security;formal method;security property;software analysis;software vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Data structures;Flow graphs;Optimizing compilers;Safety;Software performance","data flow analysis;data flow graphs;formal specification;program verification;programming language semantics;security of data","binary executable;control flow constraint specification;control flow security analysis approach;dynamic program execution;formal definition;program semantics","","1","","28","","","8-11 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the GPU-to-GPU case, we consider several refinements to a base GPU implementation and measure the performance gain from each refinement. For the host-to-host case, we analyze two strategies to communicate between the host and the GPU and show that one is optimal with respect to runtime while the other requires less device memory. This analysis is done for GPUs with one I/O channel to the host as well as those with 2. Experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU that has 240 cores running off of a Xeon 2.8 GHz quad-core host CPU show that, for the GPU-to-GPU case, our Aho-Corasick GPU adaptation achieves a speedup between 8.5 and 9.5 relative to a single-thread CPU implementation and between 2.4 and 3.2 relative to the best multithreaded implementation. For the host-to-host case, the GPU AC code achieves a speedup of 3.1 relative to a single-threaded CPU implementation. However, the GPU is unable to deliver any speedup relative to the best multithreaded code running on the quad-core host. In fact, the measured speedups for the latter case ranged between 0.74 and 0.83. Early versions of our multipattern Boyer-Moore adaptations ran 7 to 10 percent slower than corresponding versions of the AC adaptations and we did not refine the multipattern Boyer-Moore codes further.","0018-9340","","","10.1109/TC.2012.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165263","Aho-Corasick;CUDA;GPU;Multipattern string matching;multipattern Boyer-Moore","Arrays;Bandwidth;Dictionaries;Doped fiber amplifiers;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Pattern matching","graphics processing units;multi-threading;pattern matching","Boyer-Moore adaptations;GPU AC code;GPU adaptations;GPU memory;GPU-to-GPU;I/O channel;NVIDIA Tesla GT200 GPU;device memory;host-to-host multipattern string matching;multipattern Boyer-Moore string matching algorithms;multithreaded implementation","","4","","39","","2012-03-06","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

ISCC 2007. 12th IEEE Symposium on","20071112","2007","","","71","78","Distributed intrusion detection and prevention plays an increasingly important role in securing computer networks. In a distributed intrusion detection system, alerts or high-level meta-alerts are exchanged, aggregated, and correlated in a cooperative fashion to overcome the limitations of conventional intrusion detection systems. Substantial progress has been made, but current systems still suffer from various drawbacks: Most of them only distribute the data collection and not the analysis itself or they rely on a hierarchical or even centralized organization and/or communication architecture. Furthermore, the alerts or meta-alerts are usually aggregated at a pre-defined location and there is no reduction of the vast amount of alerts prior to distribution. Consequently, scalability is limited and any central component in the architecture introduces a ""single point of failure "". We propose a completely distributed intrusion detection system based on distributed hash tables to efficiently exchange and aggregate alerts and meta-alerts in a cooperative, self-organizing, and load-balanced way. Independent intrusion detection agents publish their alerts based on a new novelty measure for alerts which prohibits the distribution of already known and hence worthless knowledge. The benefits of our approach are evaluated for a well-known probing attack.","1530-1346","978-1-4244-1520-5","978-1-4244-1521-2","10.1109/ISCC.2007.4381564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381564","","Aggregates;Centralized control;Computer networks;Computer science;Information security;Intrusion detection;Mathematics;Mobile communication;Scalability;Stability","computer networks;cryptography;table lookup","computer network security;distributed hash table;distributed intrusion detection system;intrusion alert correlation;meta-alerts","","5","","26","","","1-4 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pattern matching, the main part of almost every modern intrusion detection system, should provide exceptionally high performance and ability of reconfiguration. FPGA based pattern matching sub-system becomes a popular solution for modern intrusion detection system. But there is still significant space to improve the FPGA resource efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel pattern matching implementation using the half byte comparators (HBC). HBC based pattern matching approach can increase the area efficiency. But the operating frequency will be a little decrease. We also explored some methods to improve the operating frequency in this paper. The result shows for matching more than 22,000 characters (all the rules in SNORT v2.0) our implementation achieving an area efficiency of more than 3.13 matched characters per logic cell, achieving an operating frequency of about 325 MHz (2.6 Gbps) on a Virtex-II pro device. When using quad parallelism to increase the matching throughput, the area efficiency of a logic cell is decrease to 0.71 characters for a throughput of almost 8.5 Gbps.","","0-7803-9311-2","0-7803-9312-0","10.1109/TENCON.2005.300988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085233","Combination Logic;FPGA;Half-byte Comparator;Intrusion Detection System;LUT;Pattern Matching;Register;Rule;SNORT","Costs;Field programmable gate arrays;Frequency;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic devices;Parallel processing;Pattern matching;Power system security;Throughput","comparators (circuits);field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching;safety systems","FPGA;combination logic;half byte comparators;intrusion detection system;pattern matching","","0","","17","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detectors derive from LISYS (a network-based IDS given by Hofmeyr) and have the same advantages as LISYS has such as: distributability, diversity, error tolerant, dynamic defensive, adaptability, and perfectly integrating the anomaly detection techniques with misuse detection techniques, and so on. Three monitor agents in AINIDS provide the co-stimulation signal to the detectors in order to effectively reduce the false positive alarm. These agents monitor whether the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a crucial computer system is compromised respectively. Since AINIDS adopts a more objective and reasonable co-stimulation mechanism based on the definition of intrusion and the principle of biological immune than LISYS does, it has very low false positive rate.

Most networks today use TCP/IP protocol as the standard to communicate with each other. Each host in the network is uniquely identified by its IP address. In TCP/IP architecture, there is no way to check authorization of source IP. So attackers can easily target source IP address in IP header. In this paper, we have proposed a method to verify authentication of source IP address. We identify the attacks by comparing IP address, corresponding MAC address and BIOS serial number with register database. Detected spoofing was maintained in a log. Our method is very simple and efficient as it will perform in MANET area. Thus it is effective method to identify IP and MAC spoofed attacks. I will construct the secured VOIP communication over MANET area using TCP / IP and storage Data in GSM modem as SMS (inbox). Finally using IP and MAC get fail to prevent spoofing attack then DoS attack prevent using BIOS serial number of clients.","","978-1-4673-5037-2","","10.1109/ICE-CCN.2013.6528595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528595","Cryptography;GSM modem;JDK 1.6;Oracle;Security;VOIP;Wireless ad hoc network","Computer crime;IP networks;Internet telephony;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile handsets;Servers","Internet telephony;access protocols;authorisation;cellular radio;computer network security;mobile ad hoc networks;modems;transport protocols","BIOS serial number;DoS attack;IP header;IP-spoofed attacks;Internet;MAC address;MAC-spoofed attacks;MANET area;SMS;TCP-IP protocol;VOIP communication security;data storage;defense communication;register database;source IP address authentication;wireless GSM modem","","0","","23","","","25-26 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless sensor networks represent a promising technological solution but resource constraints and exposure to external attacks could limit their employment. The design and the implementation of an effective security to provide the monitoring service with the reasonable level of reliability is the scope of this paper. Following the platform-based design methodology, we have designed and implemented a Â¿Secure PlatformÂ¿ to support Monitoring Applications which is compliant to requirements such as modularity, optimized usage of resource, solution scalability. To this aim, the Secure Platform exploits mobile agents and we have enhanced middleware solutions already available in literature. Security functions implemented in the Secure Platform have been a distributed intrusion detection system, based on a simplified approach to Hidden Markov Models, supported by an hybrid cryptographic scheme, based on network topology authentication. These security functions have been proposed.
