In this paper, by exploiting the location history traversed by a mobile user, two domain-independent online anomaly detection schemes are designed, namely the Lempel-Ziv (LZ)-based and Markov-based detection schemes. The authors focus on the identification of a group of especially harmful internal attackers-masqueraders. For both schemes, cell IDs traversed by each mobile user are extracted as the feature value. Specifically, the mobility pattern of each user is characterized by a high-order Markov model. The LZ-based detection scheme from the well-developed data compression techniques is derived. Moreover, the technique of exponentially weighted moving average is used to modify a user's normal profile dynamically. The user profile can characterize the normal behavior of each user accurately and is sensitive to abnormal changes. For the Markov-based detection scheme, a fixed-order Markov model is used to characterize the normal behavior. Based on the constructed probability transition matrix, the probability of the user's current activity is calculated. A threshold policy is then used in both schemes to determine whether a mobile device is potentially compromised or not. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. Moreover, our results show that the LZ-based detection scheme performs better than the Markov-based detection scheme, especially for low-speed mobile users","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2006.874579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1658433","Anomaly detection;cellular mobile networks;mobility","Authentication;Cellular networks;Computer science;History;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Probability;Protection;Sun","Markov processes;cellular radio;data compression;matrix algebra;telecommunication security","Lempel-Ziv-based detection;Markov-based detection schemes;cellular mobile networks;data compression techniques;mobility-based anomaly detection;online anomaly detection schemes;probability transition matrix","","11","2","21","","","July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We then use improved Kuok fuzzy data mining algorithm, which in turn a modified version of APRIORI algorithm, for implementing fuzzy rules, which allows us to construct if-then rules that reflect common ways of describing security attacks. We applied fuzzy inference engine using mamdani inference mechanism with three variable inputs for faster decision making.

This method firstly constructs various simulation elements models; secondly it constructs a network security situation awareness simulation scenario based on these constructed models; thirdly it uses abstract packet-forwarding method to quickly infer network security behaviors in simulation scenario meanwhile recording important log information; finally it evaluates the value of network security situation based on the log information and forecasts the network security situation.

To tackle the problem, a multi-resolution approach called MRDS, maintaining multiple monitoring windows with the corresponding detection thresholds, has been proposed. However, deploying such technique in a high speed network is not easy due to the time and space complexity required for calculating the number of unique destination addresses contacted in the multiple monitoring windows. In this paper, we present a novel failed flow dispersion estimation technique, called Multi-Window State Map (MWSM), which requires a small amount of memory and a constant number of memory access for implementing the multi-resolution concept. We then extend the proposed MWSM into a complete port scan detector. Simulation results with real world traffic traces indicate that the proposed estimation technique manages the expected relative error and average standard error of less than 0.8% and 9% respectively and thus the MWSM based detection scheme reduces false positives by 60% compared to MRDS.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684064","","Detectors;Dispersion;Estimation;Internet;Memory management;Monitoring;Security","estimation theory;telecommunication security","detection performance;flow dispersion estimation;multi resolution approach;multi-window state map;multiple monitoring windows;port scan detection;security systems;space complexity;time complexity","","0","","17","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experiment results demonstrate IA algorithm can update local self space having changed instead of the whole space incrementally and dynamically so that IAIDM can adjust itself to the current network environment quickly","","1-4244-0061-9","","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.259144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028567","Intrusion detection system;incompletion;natural immune system","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Cybernetics;Detectors;Environmental economics;Error analysis;Fault detection;Immune system;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Phase detection;Proteins;Random processes;Sun","computer networks;error statistics;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);random processes;security of data;telecommunication security","discrete random process;error estimation;immune-based adaptive intrusion detection system;incomplete training set;incremental algorithm","","0","","10","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, because of the ubiquitous and pervasive computing paradigm that the WSNs foster and because of the resource constrained characteristic, security & privacy issues therein assume critical investigation. Amongst many potential aspects of investigation, one has been the design of a secure routing protocol in which a value sensed to be delivered to an appropriate receiver securely and efficiently with least amount of energy consumption. We observe that LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) is a popular clustering based protocol used in WSNs. However, the same lacks any security support. Amongst numerous improvements of LEACH suggested to incorporate security & privacy, we observe that none, to the best of our knowledge offers end-to-end privacy using the homomorphic encryption schemes. We propose here an improvement of LEACH viz. E-LEACH (end-to-end secure LEACH) which uses homomorphic encryption to provide secure data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks. Due to the algebraic characteristics in homomorphic encryption, data can be algebraically aggregated without decryption and hence require least amount of energy, while ensuring privacy.","","978-1-4799-6499-4","","10.1109/ICIINFS.2014.7036607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036607","Clustering;Homomorphic Encryption;LEACH;Secure Data Aggregation","Base stations;Encryption;Routing protocols;Steady-state;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;energy consumption;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","E-LEACH;WSN;clustering based protocol;end-to-end privacy;end-to-end secure LEACH;energy consumption;homomorphic encryption schemes;low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy;pervasive computing paradigm;receiver securely;resource constrained characteristic;secure data aggregation;secure routing protocol;ubiquitous computing paradigm;wireless sensor networks","","0","","16","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, this paper is aimed at speeding up CLIPS in the case of dealing with large amount of facts and changeable facts. In this paper two measures are adopted to improve CLIP's performance, firstly RETE algorithm which is used as the rule condition-testing algorithm in CLIPS are replaced with TREAT algorithm.

In a bid to address these evolving requirements we have prototyped a hybrid firewall, using a simple firewall running on a network processor to accelerate a Linux* Netfilter Firewall executing on a general purpose processor. The simple firewall on the network processor provides high rate packet processing for all the packets while the general-purpose processor delivers high rate, full featured firewall processing for those packets that need it. This paper describes the hybrid firewall prototype with a focus on the software created to accelerate Netfilter with a network processor resident firewall. Measurements show our hybrid firewall able to maintain close to 2 Gb/sec line rate for all packet sizes, a significant improvement over the original firewall.

Challenges include malicious attacks, misconfigurations, accidental faults and operational overloads. As part of an overall strategy for network resilience, a crucial requirement is the identification of challenges in real-time, followed by the application of appropriate remedial action. In this paper, we motivate and describe a novel solution that enables the progressive multi-stage deployment of resilience strategies, based on incomplete challenge and context information. Policies are used to orchestrate the interactions between various resilience mechanisms, which incrementally identify the nature of a challenge and deploy appropriate remediation mechanisms. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach via simulation of a resource starvation attack on an Internet Service Provider infrastructure. By initially using lightweight detection and then progressively applying more heavyweight analysis, a key contribution of our work is the ability to mitigate a challenge as early as possible and rapidly detect its root cause. The approach we propose in this paper has the flexibility, reproducibility and extensibility needed to assist in the identification and remediation of various network challenges in the future.","","978-1-61284-124-3","978-1-61284-123-6","10.1109/DRCN.2011.6076900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076900","","Accuracy;Computer crime;Context;IP networks;Monitoring;Reliability;Resilience","Internet;computer network reliability","Internet service provider infrastructure;adaptive approach;computer network resilience strategy;context information policy;heavyweight analysis;lightweight detection;malicious attack;progressive multistage deployment;remedial action;remediation mechanism;resilience mechanism;resource starvation attack","","8","","25","","","10-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an example, the integration between telecommunication and physical processes, that happens when the power grid is managed and controlled, yields to epistemic uncertainty. Managing this uncertainty is possible using specific frameworks, usually coming from fuzzy theory such as Evidence Theory. This approach is attractive due to its flexibility in managing uncertainty by means of simple rule-based systems with data coming from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, Evidence Theory is applied in order to evaluate risk. Therefore, the authors propose a frame of discernment with a specific property among the elements based on a graph representation. This relationship leads to a smaller power set (called Reduced Power Set) that can be used as the classical power set, when the most common combination rules, such as Dempster or Smets, are applied. The paper demonstrates how the use of the Reduced Power Set yields to more efficient algorithms for combining evidences and to application of Evidence Theory for assessing risk.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266730","","Electronic mail;Internet;Power grids;Risk management;Security;Uncertainty","Internet;fuzzy set theory;graph theory;knowledge based systems;risk management;security of data","Internet;cyber-physical layers;epistemic uncertainty management;fuzzy theory;graph representation;graph-based evidence theory;heterogeneous sources;power grid;reduced power set;risk assessment;risk evaluation;rule-based systems","","","","","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research has shown that, in indoor environments where nodes have been deployed, variations of the signal strength can be exploited to detect movements of persons. Moreover, the time histories of the received signal strength indicator of multiple links allow reconstructing the paths followed by the persons inside the monitored area. This approach, though effective, requires the transmission of multiple, raw received signal strength indicator time histories to a central sink node for off-line analysis. This consistently increases the latency and power consumption of the system. This work aims at applying distributed processing of the received signal strength indicator for indoor surveillance purposes. Through distributed processing, the nodes are able to autonomously detect and localize moving per-sons. The latency and power consumption of the system are minimized by transmitting to the sink node only the alerts related to significant events. Moreover, power consumption is further reduced through a high accuracy time synchronization protocol, which allows the nodes to keep the radio off for 60% of the time. During the tests, the system was able to detect the intrusion of a person walking inside the monitored area and to correctly track his movements in real-time with a 0.22 m average error. Possible applications of this application include surveillance of critical areas in buildings, enhancement of workers safety in factories, support to emergency workers or police forces in locating people e.g. during fires, hostage situations or terrorist attacks.","1533-2306","978-1-4577-1118-3","","10.1109/RTCSA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029830","RSSI;distributed processing;intrusion detection;real-time monitoring;tracking","Accuracy;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Real time systems;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;security of data;signal detection;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","distributed RSSI processing;indoor environment;indoor surveillance purposes;power consumption;real-time intrusion detection;received signal strength indicator;time synchronization protocol;wireless sensor networks","","13","","28","","","28-31 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important component of the CPS devices is the sensors they use to interact with each other and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Nonetheless, current security models consider protecting only networking components of the CPS devices utilizing traditional security mechanisms (e.g., an intrusion detection system for the data that traverse the network protocol stacks). The protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect CPS devices from threats emanating from sensory channels. Using sensory channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared), an adversary can successfully attack systems. Specifically, the adversary can (1) trigger existing malware, (2) transfer malware, or (3) combine malicious use of different sensory channels to increase the impact of the attack on CPS devices. In this work, we focus on these novel sensory channel threats to CPS devices and applications. We first note how sensory channel threats are an emerging area for the CPS world. Then, we analyze the performance various sensory channel threats. Moreover, using an iRobot Create as our CPS platform, we exploit simple vulnerable programs on iRobot through its infrared channel. Finally, we introduce the design of a novel sensory channel aware intrusion detection system as a protection mechanism against the sensory channel threats for CPS devices.","","","","10.1109/CNS.2014.6997498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997498","CPS Security;Cyber-Physical Systems;Sensory Attacks;Sensory-channel threats","Accelerometers;Malware;Robot sensing systems;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","invasive software","CPS;cyber physical systems;iRobot Create;intrusion detection system;malware;novel computing paradigm;security models;sensory channel threats;sensory channels","","0","","39","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, extending the functionality and the lifetime of products requires the addition of new functionality to track and satisfy the customers needs and market and technology trends. Many contemporary products along with the software part incorporate hardware accelerators for reasons of performance and power efficiency. While adaptivity of software is straightforward, adaptation of the hardware to changing requirements constitutes a challenging problem requiring delicate solutions. The FASTER (Facilitating Analysis and Synthesis Technologies for Effective Reconfiguration) project aims at introducing a complete methodology to allow designers to easily implement a system specification on a platform which includes a general purpose processor combined with multiple accelerators running on an FPGA, taking as input a high-level description and fully exploiting, both at design time and at run time, the capabilities of partial dynamic reconfiguration. The goal is that for selected application domains, the FASTER toolchain will be able to reduce the design and verification time of complex reconfigurable systems providing additional novel verification features that are not available in existing tool flows.","","978-1-4673-2570-7","978-1-4673-2571-4","10.1109/ReCoSoC.2012.6322881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6322881","","Computer architecture;Context;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Runtime;Schedules;Software","customer satisfaction;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;microprocessor chips;performance evaluation;power aware computing;reconfigurable architectures","FASTER project;FASTER toolchain;FPGA;Facilitating Analysis and Synthesis Technologies for Effective Reconfiguration project;complex reconfigurable systems;customer satisfaction;customer tracking;design time reduction;general purpose processor;hardware accelerators;hardware adaptation;high-level description;market trends;partial dynamic reconfiguration;performance efficiency;power efficiency;product lifetime;smart technologies;software adaptivity;system specification;technology trends;user applications;verification time reduction","","1","","14","","","9-11 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In DPI the packet payload is compared against a set of predefined patterns which can be specified using regular expressions (regexes). It is well-known that mapping regexes to deterministic finite automata (DFA) will suffer from the state explosion problem. Through observation, we attribute DFA explosion to the necessity of remembering matching history. In this paper, we investigate how to record the matching history efficiently and propose an extended DFA approach for regex matching called fcq-FA, which can make a memory size reduction of about 1000 times with a fully automated approach. In fcq-FA, we use pipeline queues and counters to help recording the matching history. Hence, state explosion caused by Kleene closure and repetitions can be definitely avoided. Further, it achieves a fully automated signature compilation with polynomial running time and space.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501976","","Automata;Communications Society;Counting circuits;Doped fiber amplifiers;Explosions;History;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Paper technology;Polynomials","","","","1","1","14","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first part of the framework a social network has to be derived for a given community of users. In the second part the group of users that have the highest influence on the communication in the social network has to be located. The group betweenness centrality measure is used to evaluate the influence of each candidate group. In the third part we analyze the threat propagation in the social network assuming that a distributed network intrusion detection system (DNIDS) is monitoring the traffic of the group. The analysis is performed using a network simulator that was developed for this purpose. In the fourth part a DNIDS has to be deployed on a range of ISPs in order to monitor and clean the traffic of the users belonging to the central group. We applied the new framework by deriving the social network of 1000 students, finding the most influential group of users, and analyzing the influence of the deployment of DNIDS using a simulation tool.

Viral spreads that attack the end user or the nodes and hence the traffic on the network increases by self duplication and perpetuation. The net effect is, increase of senseless throughput spiraling, multiplication of load, and increased delay, leading to severe congestion and crash. Thus there is a need to monitor the network for throughput, delay and probability of error and ensure the prompt remedial measures to keep the network operating, robustly by identifying viral packets in the network, at each router and for the resident algorithm to take necessary action on such packets. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach for computer virus detection and elimination in networks. The proposed method works in two stages. In the first stage, a combination of the signature based Port scanning technique, along with a Monitoring method to prevent execution of viral instruction sequences, is used, for detection of network viruses. In the second stage, this Network Intrusion Detection system [NIDS] is installed on all the intermediate routers and end systems in a real network, and throughput and other QoS parameters are monitored.

To generalize the problem, the game data are assumed not to be fully known to the players, who take a robust optimization approach to address this data uncertainty. For assessing the validity and effectiveness of the framework, illustrative instances of the developed game model are generated. Equilibrium analysis reveals how the conflicting objectives of the intruder and intrusion detection system compel them to adopt different conservative stances toward data uncertainty.

Functional tests and performance analysis of the proposed TCAM are conducted by using a FPGA design tool and the simulation results with the SNORT rules show that the proposed TCAM architecture and algorithm reduce 93% of TCAM entries at the expense of little hardware overhead of 2 bits per a memory word","","1-4244-0574-2","1-4244-0574-2","10.1109/APCC.2006.255932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4023040","TCAM;negation rule;packet filter;range rule","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Field programmable gate arrays;Filtering algorithms;Impedance matching;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Reflective binary codes;Routing;Testing","Gray codes;content-addressable storage;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA design tool;Gray code generation;SNORT rules;extended TCAM;negation rules;packet classification;ternary content addressable memory","","0","1","15","","","Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sci., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Dependable Systems and Networks, 2004 International Conference on","20040726","2004","","","102","111","Many classifications of attacks have been tendered, often in taxonomic form, A common basis of these taxonomies is that they have been framed from the perspective of an attacker - they organize attacks with respect to the attacker's goals, such as privilege elevation from user to root (from the well known Lincoln taxonomy). Taxonomies based on attacker goals are attack-centric; those based on defender goals are defense-centric. Defenders need a way of determining whether or not their detectors will detect a given attack. It is suggested that a defense-centric taxonomy would suit this role more effectively than an attack-centric taxonomy. This paper presents a new, defense-centric attack taxonomy, based on the way that attacks manifest as anomalies in monitored sensor data. Unique manifestations, drawn from 25 attacks, were used to organize the taxonomy, which was validated through exposure to an intrusion-detection system, confirming attack detect ability. The taxonomy's predictive utility was compared against that of a well-known extant attack-centric taxonomy. The defense-centric taxonomy is shown to be a more effective predictor of a detector's ability to detect specific attacks, hence informing a defender that a given detector is competent against an entire class of attacks.","","0-7695-2052-9","","10.1109/DSN.2004.1311881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1311881","","Computer science;Detectors;Laboratories;Monitoring;Operating systems;Sensor systems;Taxonomy","authorisation;computer crime","Lincoln taxonomy;attack classification;attack detectability;attack manifestations;attack-centric taxonomy;defense-centric taxonomy;intrusion detection;sensor data monitoring","","12","","30","","","28 June-1 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Antigens are profiles of system calls while corresponding behaviors are regarded as signals. This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are ""embedded"" to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses. Accordingly, computer hosts met with malicious intrusions can be effectively detected via input signals and temporary output signals such as PAMP, danger and safe signals.","1098-7584","978-1-4244-7315-1","978-1-4244-7316-8","10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007564","artificial immune systems;dendritic cell algorithm;intrusion detection;multiagent","Adaptive systems;Computers;Context;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection","artificial immune systems;multi-agent systems;security of data","activation threshold;adaptive immune subsystem;agent-based artificial immune systems;artificial T-cell agents;computer host;danger theory;danger value calculation;dendritic cell functionality;dentritic cells agents;human immune system;innate immune subsystem;intrusion detection systems;malicious behaviors;malicious intrusions;mature context antigen value calculation;multiagent-based IDS;security operating center","","1","","14","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IDtk was developed through a user-centered design process, in which we identified design guidelines to support ID users. ID analysts protect their networks by searching for evidence of attacks in ID system output, firewall and system logs, and other complex, textual data sources. Monitoring and analyzing these sources incurs a heavy cognitive load for analysts. The use of information visualization techniques offers a valuable addition to the toolkit of the ID analyst. Several visualization techniques for ID have been developed, but few usability or field studies have been completed to assess the needs of ID analysts and the usability and usefulness of these tools. We intended to fill this gap by applying a user-centered design process in the development and evaluation of IDtk, a 3D, glyph-based visualization tool that gives the user maximum flexibility in setting up how the visualization display represents ID data. The user can also customize whether the display is a simple, high-level overview to support monitoring, or a more complex 3D view allowing for viewing the data from multiple angles and thus supporting analysis and diagnosis. This flexibility was found crucial in our usability evaluation.

This feature is converted as a balance mechanism in interactive TCP traffic replay and incorporated into the current state-based method. In this way, the cost of state-checking can be significantly reduced and the replay performance is thus enhanced. To validate the effectiveness of the method we implement it by building an interactive replay system. The experimental results indicate that: 1) balance-checking reduces the overhead of state-checking by 40%; 2) the balance-based method enhances the overall replay performance by an average of 5% when the actual TCP traffic traces are replayed.","1550-3607","978-1-4244-6402-9","","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501960","","Communication system traffic control;Communications Society;Costs;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Protocols;TCPIP;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Traffic control","","","","1","","17","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The role of the fractional order controller is to introduce frequency-dependent damping of the forced oscillation of the system caused hills and valleys as well as by small dips and bumps on the road. It is pointed out that while the dashpot system serves as a nonlinear component saving the floor of the chassis its frequency transmission properties are undesirable in the higher frequency part of the excitation.

We monitor the execution of a malware sample in a controlled environment and summarize the obtained high-level network information in a graph. We then analyze graphs similarity to determine whether such high-level behavioral profile is sufficient to provide accurate classification of malware samples.

The main objective of this paper is to propose the Protocol Independent Detection and Classification (PIDC) system in order to prevent the web servers from devastating attacks such as Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. The DRDoS flooding attack exploits fixed IP spoofing to defeat the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack prevention measures. This is the first paper to detect and classify the types of reflected attacks using SNMP MIB variables. The proposed PIDC system uses the data mining and machine learning techniques to detect all types of reflected flooding attacks. The rank correlation based detection algorithm retrieves the incoming traffic in the form of Simple Network Management Protocol -Management Information Base (SNMP-MIB) variables and finds the relationship between the MIB variables to detect the attacks from the normal traffic. Then, C4.5 classification algorithm extracts and frames association rule based on protocol information from reflected DDoS flooding attacks. Finally, the CPU, memory and disk resource distribution to legitimate requests are also increased. This method achieves 99% of true positive rates and less false positive rate of (1%) when compared to existing reflected attack detection methods. Moreover, these attacks are classified by types such as TCP reflection attacks and DNS reflection attacks with the highest probability of attack traffic.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996154","Amplification attacks;Bandwidth attacks;DRDoS attacks;High rate flooding attacks;Reflection attacks","Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Reflection;Servers","Internet;computer centres;computer network management;computer network security;data mining;file servers;pattern classification;protocols","C4.5 classification algorithm;CPU;DDoS attack prevention measures;DNS reflection attacks;DRDoS attack;DRDoS flooding;PIDC system;SNMP MIB variables;SNMP-MIB variables;TCP reflection attacks;Web servers;attack traffic probability;data center servers;data mining;disk resource distribution;distributed denial of service attack prevention measures;distributed reflection denial of service attacks;fixed IP spoofing;flooding attack classification;flooding attack detection;frames association rule;incoming traffic retrieval;machine learning techniques;protocol independent detection and classification system;protocol information;rank correlation based detection algorithm;simple network management protocol-management information base variables","","0","","13","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current NIDSs are designed to 10/100 Mbps [6], nevertheless large network installations are Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps), so the task of detection becomes increasingly difficult with only one NIDS.

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7980-6","","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;alphabet compression;deep packet inspection;multi-byte matching;regular expressions","Automata;Educational institutions;Indexes;Inspection;Memory management;Parallel processing;Pattern matching","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","ACT;alphabet compression table;deterministic finite automata;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;multibyte pattern matching;processing complexity;regular expression matching;stride-2 SPPM;stride-k DFA compression technique;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching","","0","","24","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To understand the gap between available checklists and practice, we conducted a series of interviews to encode the decision-making process of security experts and novices during security requirements analysis. Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts: source code, and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities. We framed our study using Situation Awareness-a cognitive theory from psychology-to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis. We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive, comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications, in addition, to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications.

We need to distinguish anomalies that change the traffic either abruptly or slowly. While a good amount of research has been done for fixed wired networks, not much research has been done in this area for wireless networks due to lack of a good data set.

Due to its large memory footprint, a large-dictionary AC-DFA can experience poor cache performance when matching against inputs with high match ratio on multicore processors. We propose a head-body finite automaton (HBFA), which implements SPM in two parts: a head DFA (H-DFA) and a body NFA (B-NFA). The H-DFA matches the dictionary up to a predefined prefix length in the same way as AC-DFA, but with a much smaller memory footprint. The B-NFA extends the matching to full dictionary lengths in a compact variable-stride branch data structure, accelerated by single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. A branch grafting mechanism is proposed to opportunistically advance the state of the H-DFA with the matching progress in the B-NFA. Compared with a fully populated AC-DFA, our HBFA prototype has <;1/5 construction time, requires <;1/20 runtime memory, and achieves 3x to 8x throughput when matching real-life large dictionaries against inputs with high match ratios.

Finally, we apply our methodology to most important automaton models, memory layouts, and well-known signature sets.

Analogous to traffic normalization for network intrusion detection systems, the proposed RouteNormalizer patches ambiguities and eliminates semantically incorrect routing updates to protect against routing protocol attacks. Furthermore, it serves the purpose of a router firewall by identifying resource-based attacks against routers. Upon detecting anomalous routing changes, it suggests local routing policy modifications to improve route selection decisions. Deploying a RouteNormalizer requires no modification to routers if desired using a transparent TCP proxy setup. In this paper, we present the detailed design of the RouteNormalizer and evaluate it using a prototype implementation based on empirical BGP routing updates.

However, very few studies have been conducted to quantify the validity of this hypothesis. In this paper, attack data were collected using a test-bed dedicated to monitoring attackers. The data collected consist of port scans, ICMP scans, vulnerability scans, successful attacks and management traffic. Two experiments were performed to validate the hypothesis of linking port scans and vulnerability scans to the number of packets observed per connection. Customized scripts were then developed to filter the collected data and group them on the basis of scans and attacks between a source and destination IP address pair.

We take advantage of explorative mind-maps, which have been demonstrated in [10] and which are altogether a management framework that emerges automatically from the data input stream it gets. An explorative mind-map is a non-verificative but dynamic system that basis on the natural paradigm: it changes its complexity continuously and fosters symbolic cells according to internal activation states. Generally, the structure mirrors a mental state where the oblivion of associated facts arrive once the stimulation decreases. Considering two mind-maps A<sub>1,2</sub> and B<sub>1,2</sub> for two conversational partners A and B, the mind-map <sub>*1</sub> represents the self-conversation and <sub>*2</sub> the conversational stream of the conversational partner. If we merge these mind-maps, we may apply the out-coming results for the computation of trust.","","978-1-4244-7716-6","","10.1109/AICCSA.2010.5587033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587033","Adaptive Information Management;Brain Informatics;Cognitive Systems;Nature-inspired Learning;Trustworthiness","Adaptation model;Cognition;Computer architecture;Conferences;Merging;Presses;Skeleton","cognition;information management;interactive systems","associative information management system;conversational streams management;data input stream;explorative mind maps;management framework","","1","","10","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which is able to protect a CI from attacks directed to its WSN-based parts. By providing accurate and timely detection of malicious activities, the proposed IDS solution ultimately results in a dramatic improvement in terms of protection, since opportunities are given for performing proper remediation/reconfiguration actions, which counter the attack and/or allow the system to tolerate it. We present the basic ideas, discuss the main implementation issues, and perform a preliminary experimental campaign. Not only have experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in protecting the system against two very serious attacks to WSNs (namely: sinkhole, and bogus packet), but they have also proved that the stringent requirements (in terms of limited availability of resources) which are typical of current state-of-the-art WSN technologies, are met.","","978-1-4244-8080-7","","10.1109/CRIS.2010.5617547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5617547","Critical Information Infrastructures;Critical Infrastructures;Intrusion Detection;Wireless Sensor Networks","Base stations;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","security of data;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","bogus packet;critical information infrastructures;intrusion detection system;malicious activities;sinkhole;wireless sensor network","","6","","34","","","20-22 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It requires generally the analysis of a huge amount of data with high accuracy and low complexity. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection mechanism against flooding attacks in high speed networks. The proposed mechanism is based on Jensen-Shannon divergence metric over sketch data structure. This sketch is used to reduce the required memory, while monitoring the traffic, by maintaining them into a predefined fixed size of hash tables. This sketch is also used to develop a probabilistic model. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is used for detecting deviations between previously established and current distributions of network traffic. We have implemented our approach and evaluated it using real Internet traffic traces, obtained from MAWI trans-Pacific wide transit link between USA and Japan. Our results show that the proposed approach is scalable and efficient in detecting anomalies without maintaining per-flow state information.","1550-3607","978-1-4577-2052-9","978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364602","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364602","","Arrays;IP networks;Internet;Monitoring;Radiation detectors;Time series analysis","Internet;cryptography;data structures;telecommunication traffic","Japan;Jensen-Shannon divergence metric;MAWI trans-Pacific wide transit link;USA;anomaly detection;flooding attacks;hash tables;high speed networks;network traffic;per-flow state information;probabilistic model;real Internet traffic traces;sketch data structure;traffic monitoring","","1","","23","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Accelerating Multi-Patterns Matching on Compressed HTTP Traffic","Bremler-Barr, A.; Koral, Y.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Interdiscipl. Center, Herzliya","INFOCOM 2009, IEEE","20090602","2009","","","397","405","One of the fundamental technique which is used today by network security tools to detect malicious activities is 'signature based' detection. Today, the performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of the string-matching algorithms that detect these signatures. Currently these security tools do not deal with compressed traffic, which becomes more and more common in HTTP. HTTP protocol uses the GZIP compression, which first requires some kind of decompression phase before performing the multi-patterns matching task. Thus, there is a high performance penalty in pattern matching on compressed data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, Aho-Corasick-based algorithm for compressed HTTP (ACCH) that takes advantage of information gathered by the decompression phase in order to accelerate the commonly used Aho-Corasick pattern matching algorithm. We show by analyzing real HTTP traffic and real WAF signatures patterns, that we can skip scanning up to 75% of the data. Surprisingly, we show that in some situations, it is faster to do pattern matching on the compressed data, with the penalty of decompression, than doing pattern matching on regular traffic. As far as we know we are the first paper, that analyzes the problem of 'on-the-fly' multi-patterns matching algorithms on compressed HTTP traffic and suggest a solution.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-3512-8","978-1-4244-3513-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061944","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Compression algorithms;Computer science;Data security;Encoding;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","Internet;data compression;digital signatures;string matching;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","Aho-Corasick multipattern matching algorithm;GZIP compression;HTTP protocol;Web traffic;compressed HTTP traffic;decompression phase;malicious activity detection;network security tool;signature-based detection;string-matching algorithm","","5","3","25","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Normal connections are self-bodies. A correct and complete self-body set can be used for an antibody set. If a new network connection doesn't match any self-body, it is abnormal. An adaptive antibody generation model is presented firstly. Based on it, an adaptive intrusion detection system is introduced.

Due to this phenomenon, how to provide the aged people and the patients with chronic diseases a suitable environment of health care has become a critical issue currently. Therefore, we propose a new scheme that applies health care within wireless sensor networks in which sensor nodes can measure the vital signs of the aged people and the patients. The vital signs for blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature measured by sensor nodes would be transmitted to mobile devices of medical staff and system administrator. Sensor node readings enable the medical staff to understand the conditions of the patients in real time which improves the quality of health care for the patients. According to the personal data protection act, the vital signs of the patients can only be accessed by the authorized medical staff. In order to protect the privacy of patients, the administrator will verify the identity of medical staff through the mobile device with smart card and password. Accordingly, only the verified medical staff can obtain the vital signs such as blood pressure, pulsation, and body temperature of the patients. Besides, the scheme includes a characteristic of time-bounded, and then the medical staffs can obtain the vital signs without re-authenticating and re-login into the system in a period of time. Consequently, the time-bounded property increases the work efficiency of the system administrator and user.","","978-1-4673-0867-0","","10.1109/WAINA.2012.205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6185312","Sensor Node;Smart Card;User Authentication;Wireless Sensor Networks","Authentication;Encryption;Law;Smart cards;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;biometrics (access control);blood pressure measurement;diseases;health care;medical information systems;patient care;smart cards;wireless sensor networks","authorized medical staff;average life expectancy;blood pressure measurement;body temperature measurement;chronic disease;fertility rate;health care;mobile device;patient privacy protection;personal data protection act;pulsation measurement;secure authentication scheme;sensor node;smart card;time-bounded property;wireless sensor network","","0","","11","","","26-29 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current storage systems for such log files are generally prone to modification attacks, especially by an intruder who wishes to wipe out the trail he leaves during a successful break-in. In light of recent advances in storage capacity and sharp drop in prices of storage devices, as well as the demand for trustworthy storage systems, it is timely to design and develop fast storage systems that practically have no limit in capacity and admit ""secure append-only"" operations (namely data can only be appended to a storage device; once appended it can no longer be modified, and can be read out by authorized users only.) This paper reports some preliminary findings in our research into building a secure append-only storage system. It discusses a possible secure append-only storage architecture that could be used to detect and prevent deletion or modification by inside/outside attackers.
