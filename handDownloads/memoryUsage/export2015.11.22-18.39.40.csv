Software vulnerability may jeopardize information confidentiality and cause software failure leading tocatastrophic threats to humans or severe economic losses. Size, complexity, extensibility, connectivity and the search for cheap systems make it very hard or even impossible to manually tackle vulnerability detection. Search based software testing attempts to solve two aspects of the cost - vulnerabilityproblem. First, it's cheaper because itis far less labor intensive when compared to traditional testing techniques. As a result, it can be used to more thoroughly test software and reduce the risk that a vulnerability slips into production code. Also, search based software testing can be specifically tailored to tackle the subset of well known security vulnerabilities responsible for most security threats. This paper is divided into two parts. It examines promising search based testing approaches to detecting software vulnerabilities, and then presents some of the most interesting open research problems.","","978-1-4244-4356-7","","10.1109/ICSTW.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976374","high dependability software;search based software testing;vulnerability exposure","Application software;Computer security;Costs;Data security;Humans;Production;Software performance;Software safety;Software systems;Software testing","data privacy;program testing;security of data","code breaking;computerized system security;cost-vulnerability problem;information confidentiality;pervasive problem;search based software testing;software failure;software security;software vulnerability","","1","","70","","","1-4 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy.

This growth is mostly because of the popularity of the shared content and the great enhancement in the P2P protocol since it first came out with Napster. The shared files are generally both large and copyrighted. Motivated by the problems of UlakNet with the P2P traffic, we propose a novel method for P2P traffic-detection in the network backbone in this paper. Observing the similarity between detecting traffic that belongs to a specific protocol and detecting an intrusion in a computer system, we adopt an intrusion detection system (IDS) technique to detect P2P traffic. Our method is a passive detection procedure that uses traffic flows gathered from border routers. Hence, it is scalable and does not have the problems of other approaches that rely on packet pay load data or transport layer ports","","1-4244-0491-6","","10.1109/ISCN.2006.1662521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662521","Bayesian Networks;P2P;intrusion detection systems;peer-to-peer;traffic characterization","Application software;Bandwidth;Copyright protection;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Spine;Telecommunication traffic","computer network management;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Napster;P2P traffic detection;Turkish academic network;UlakNet;border routers;computer system intrusion;intrusion detection system;national academic network backbone;packet pay load data;passive detection procedure;peer-to-peer protocol;scalable detection;total network traffic;transport layer ports","","2","","38","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a tool, called Geno Guard, for providing strong protection for genomic data both today and in the long term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE): it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard.","1081-6011","","","10.1109/SP.2015.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163041","brute-force attack;distribution-transforming encoder;genomic privacy;honey encryption","Bioinformatics;Encoding;Encryption;Genomics","biology computing;cryptography;data privacy;genetics;statistical distributions;storage management","GenoGuard;HE;brute-force attacks;data breaches;encryption keys;genetic database populations;genetic materials;genomic data protection;honey encryption;information-theoretic confidentiality;parallelized software implementation;passwords;probability distributions;storage security","","1","","49","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sheer amount of traffic to be analyzed prevents any attempt to move intrusion detection to core routers, however Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS) may provide a solution.

To counter these kinds of attacks, a framework of cooperative intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed. The proposed system could reduce the impact of these kinds of attacks. To provide such ability, IDSs in the cloud computing regions exchange their alerts with each other. In the system, each of IDSs has a cooperative agent used to compute and determine whether to accept the alerts sent from other IDSs or not. By this way, IDSs could avoid the same type of attack happening. The implementation results indicate that the proposed system could resist DoS attack. Moreover, by comparison, the proposed cooperative IDS system only increases little computation effort compared with pure Snort based IDS but prevents the system from single point of failure attack.","1530-2016","978-1-4244-7918-4","978-0-7695-4157-0","10.1109/ICPPW.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5599084","cloud computing;cooperative intrusion detection system;denial-of-service attack;distributed denial-of-service attack","Cloud computing;Clouds;Computer crime;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Simulation","Internet;security of data;software agents","DoS attack;Internet;cloud computing networks;cloud computing region exchange;cooperative IDS system;cooperative agent;cooperative intrusion detection system framework;distributed denial-of-service attack","","20","1","10","","","13-16 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we mainly focus on the vulnerability of the network to a suction attack called blackhole attack. In detecting such attacks, we explore the use of intelligent agents called honeypots which are roaming virtual software agents that generate a dummy route request (RREQ) packets to lure and trap blackhole attackers. We illustrate the performance of our proposed detection approach by extensive simulation results using the ns-2 simulator.","","978-1-4244-5113-5","","10.1109/MOBHOC.2009.5336925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5336925","AODV;Blackhole;Honey pots;Malicious;Spoofed;Wireless Mesh Networks","Computer crime;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Relays;Routing protocols;Software agents;Spread spectrum communication;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless mesh networks","Internet;internetworking;radio networks;routing protocols;software agents;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","Internet gateway;blackhole attack detection;cooperatively relay;dummy route request;intelligent honeypot agent;routing protocol;static mesh router;virtual software agent;wireless mesh network","","6","","21","","","12-15 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Approaches for an automated re-use of design and modeling decisions of available signatures also do not exist. In this paper we present an approach for systematic engineering of signatures which is based on the re-use of existing signatures. It exploits similarities with known attacks for the engineering process. The method applies an iterative abstraction of signatures. Based on a weighted assessment of the abstractions the signature engineer can select the most appropriate signatures or fragments of signatures for the development of the signature for a new attack.

We handle missed detections through the analysis of network vulnerability dependencies, unlike previous approaches that infer hypothetical attacks. In particular, we quantify lack of knowledge through attack graph distance. We show that low-pass signal filtering of event correlation sequences improves results in the face of erroneous detections. We also show how a correlation threshold can be applied for creating strongly correlated attack scenarios.

This work presents the design & implementation of a new distributed firewall model, based on stateful Cluster Security Gateway (CSG) architecture, which addresses those shortcomings. This distributed security model adopts a bottom-up approach such that each cluster of end-user hosts is first secured using the CSG architecture. These different CSGs are then centrally managed by the Network Administrator. A file-based firewall update mechanism is used for dynamic real-time security. IPsec is used to secure the firewall policy update distribution while X.509 certificates cater for sender/receiver authentication. The major benefits of this approach to distributed security include tamper resistance, anti-spoofing, anti-sniffing, secure real-time firewall updating, low overall network load, high scalability and low firewall convergence times.","","978-1-4244-2912-7","978-1-4244-2913-4","10.1109/COMSNETS.2009.4808875","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4808875","Layer 2 per-packet load balancing;distributed cluster security;distributed firewall;stateful CSG architecture","Authentication;Convergence;Filtering;Load management;Protection;Prototypes;Robustness;Scalability;Security;Software prototyping","authorisation;distributed processing","cluster security gateway architecture;distributed firewall architecture;dynamic real-time security;file-based firewall update mechanism;firewall policy update distribution;network administrator;receiver authentication;robust distributed security;sender authentication","","2","","31","","","5-10 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-driven signatures at network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for the worms exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very difficult for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst-case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","1063-6692","","","10.1109/TNET.2009.2020431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5200325","length-based signature;polymorphic worm;worm signature generation;zero-day vulnerability","Buffer overflow;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protection;Protocols;Resilience;Runtime;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic","digital signatures;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","attack resilience bounds;buffer overflow vulnerabilities;honeynets;host level analysis;network gateways;network traffic;network-level length-based signature generation;noise injection;signature matching;vulnerability driven signatures;zero-day polymorphic worms","","4","2","47","","2009-08-11","Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We introduce the notion of a dimension to denote different criteria which can be used to classify botnet detection techniques. We demonstrate that classification by dimensions is particularly useful for evaluating botnet detection mechanisms through various metrics of interest. We also show how botnet behavioral features from the first taxonomy affect the accuracy of the detection approaches in the second taxonomy.

Generally, a lot of commercial VoIP services use SIP and RTP for signaling and voice transport protocols. Most commercial VoIP service providers employ only simple security functions such as basic authentication without packet encryption because of fast implementation and deployment. Therefore, the VoIP service is highly vulnerable to several threats and attacks, because secure protocols for carrying VoIP packets are not fully utilized. For instance, unencrypted SIP packets including authentication messages could be easily forged to be exploited for generating anomaly traffic by malicious users. In this paper, we propose a flow-based VoIP anomaly traffic detection method that could find three representative VoIP anomaly attacks of SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding that could be easily exploited in the real VoIP network. Our scheme uses the IETF IPFIX standard for monitoring VoIP calls in flow units. From the experiments with the commercial SIP phones in the real VoIP network, we show that SIP CANCEL, BYE DoS and RTP flooding attacks are easily generated and that they could be detected effectively by our proposed method.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598131","IPFIX;SIP;VoIP;anomaly flow","Authentication;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Monitoring;Protocols;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","Internet telephony;cryptographic protocols;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wireless LAN","BYE DoS;IETF IPFIX standard;RTP flooding;SIP CANCEL;VoIP network;anomaly traffic detection;message authentication;packet encryption;voice transport protocols;wireless LAN","","3","","16","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In traffic monitoring, a new recognition paradigm is proposed in which it minimizes unnecessary recognition.

Firstly, the image energy model is established, the energy minimization constraint technology is used to make the average output energy of local image area be minimum, and the infrared image noise and clutter signal are suppressed. The directional gradient features of infrared target are extracted, and the potential small targets can be identified with its direction gradient in sequential frames. The multiple frames determination results are obtained, and the fusion result is used to detect the target.

Unfortunately, IP offers best effort service and Quality of Service (QoS) is not guaranteed. In order to provide QoS guarantees over the Internet, overlay networks are used. Impairments happening at the network layer such as delays and packet losses significantly affect the quality of the IPTV stream. Hence, a reliable mechanism to monitor the Quality of Experience (QoE) of IPTV users is essential to an IPTV service provider in order to avoid customer churn. It is essential that an IPTV provider be able to monitor the QoE with minimal overhead. Therefore, we propose a utility based QoE monitoring approach based on statistical losses at the application layer. This paper also presents mathematical proofs and simulation results that confirm the suitability and effectiveness of our proposed method.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-9266-4","978-1-4244-9267-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6133919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133919","","Animation;IPTV;Loss measurement;Monitoring;Quality of service;Sensitivity","IPTV;broadband networks;overlay networks;quality of service;statistical analysis;television broadcasting;video on demand","IPTV quality of experience;IPTV service provider;IPTV stream quality;Internet protocol television;QoS;broadband network layer;broadcast TV;loss-based utility function;mathematical proofs;overlay network;packet loss;quality of service;statistical loss;utility based QoE monitoring approach;video-on-demand","","4","","29","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since data in computer networks is growing rapidly, the analysis of these large amounts of data to discover anomaly fragments has to be done within a reasonable amount of time. Some of the past and current intrusion detection systems are based on a clustering approach. However, in order to cope with the increasing amount of data, new parallel methods need to be developed in order to make the algorithms scalable. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system based on a parallel particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm using the MapReduce methodology. The use of particle swarm optimization for the clustering task is a very efficient way since particle swarm optimization avoids the sensitivity problem of initial cluster centroids as well as premature convergence. The proposed intrusion detection system processes large data sets on commodity hardware. The experimental results on a real intrusion data set demonstrate that the proposed intrusion detection system scales very well with increasing data set sizes. Moreover, it achieves close to the linear speedup by improving the intrusion detection and false alarm rates.","","978-1-4799-0453-2","978-1-4799-0452-5","10.1109/CEC.2013.6557670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557670","","Clustering algorithms;Data models;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Particle swarm optimization;Testing;Vectors","computer network security;parallel algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering","MapReduce intrusion detection system;anomaly fragments discover;commodity hardware;computer networks;false alarm rates;initial cluster centroids;large data sets;particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm;premature convergence;sensitivity problem","","2","","20","","","20-23 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper presents a constructive approach to the modeling, specification and analysis of application-specific security requirements. The method is based on a goal-oriented framework for generating and resolving obstacles to goal satisfaction. The extended framework addresses malicious obstacles (called anti-goals) set up by attackers to threaten security goals. Threat trees are built systematically through anti-goal refinement until leaf nodes are derived that are either software vulnerabilities observable by the attacker or anti-requirements implementable by this attacker. New security requirements are then obtained as countermeasures by application of threat resolution operators to the specification of the anti-requirements and vulnerabilities revealed by the analysis. The paper also introduces formal epistemic specification constructs and patterns that may be used to support a formal derivation and analysis process. The method is illustrated on a Web-based banking system for which subtle attacks have been reported recently.","0270-5257","0-7695-2163-0","","10.1109/ICSE.2004.1317437","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317437","","Application software;Banking;Biomedical engineering;Communication system security;Computer crime;Cryptography;Internet;Mission critical systems;Pattern analysis;Surgery","Internet;bank data processing;formal specification;security of data","Web-based banking;formal analysis;formal specification;goal satisfaction;requirements engineering;security requirements","","69","1","42","","","23-28 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This eliminates the need to have multiple physical machines host diverse operating systems typically deployed in remote network security labs. In preparation for a course on intrusion detection systems (IDS), the instructor creates pre-configured virtual machines and network trace files for studentspsila use. These virtual machines are then installed by the students on their personal computers at home and used to conduct lab exercises. The virtual lab approach is different from the centralized remote laboratory because students run the lab on their own computers and do not depend on the remote servers. Additionally, the virtual environments allow rapid changes to be made to the lab exercises or environments thus allowing instruction with up-to-date technologies. Furthermore, the burden of maintaining centralized physical labs has been lifted from the institutionpsilas shoulders.

The basic idea behind IMS is convergence; providing a single interface to different traditional or modern networking architectures allowing better working environment for the end users. IMS is still not commercially adopted and used but research is in progress to explore it. IMS is an IP based overlay next generation network architecture. It inherent number of security threats of session initiation protocol (SIP), TCP, UDP etc as it uses SIP and IP protocols. Some of them can degrade the performance of IMS seriously and may cause DoS or DDoS attacks. The paper presents a new approach keeping a vision of secure IMS based on intrusion detection system (IDS) using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) as classifier. The KNN classifier can effectively detect intrusive attacks and achieve a low false positive rate. It can distinguish between the normal behavior of the system or abnormal. In this paper, we have focused on the key element of IMS core known as proxy call session control function (PCSCF). Network based anomaly detection mechanism is proposed using KNN as anomaly detector. Experiments are performed on OpenIMS core and the result shows that IMS is vulnerable to different types of attacks such as UDP flooding, IP spoofing that can cause DoS. KNN classifier effectively distinguishes the behavior of the system as normal or intrusive and achieve low false positive rate.","","978-1-4244-2823-6","978-1-4244-2824-3","10.1109/INMIC.2008.4777775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4777775","3GPP;DoS;IDS;IMS;KNN;PCSCF","Computer crime;Convergence;Degradation;Detectors;Intrusion detection;Multimedia systems;Next generation networking;Protocols;Quality of service;TCPIP","3G mobile communication;IP networks;multimedia communication;pattern classification;quality of service;security of data;transport protocols","3GPP;IP multimedia subsystem;IP protocols;IP spoofing;OpenIMS core;TCP;UDP flooding;intrusion detection system;k-nearest neighbor classifier;overlay next generation network architecture;proxy call session control function;quality of service;session initiation protocol","","1","","29","","","23-24 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though network security appliances are widely deployed to resist these attacks, there is a lack of dynamic and collaborative platform to flexibly configure and manage all the security elements. In this paper, we present NetSecu, a platform based on Java and Click Router, which can dynamically enable, disable and configure security elements such as firewall, IPS and AV. Furthermore, a collaborate module is implemented to integrate individual NetSecu platform into a Secure Overlay Network, providing collaborative traffic control against DDoS attack. Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node. A Central Management Site acts as the root node for large scale deployment. The policy is distributed from higher level to lower level NetSecu nodes, while security events are aggregated from lower level to higher level. Performance evaluation shows that our NetSecu system can achieve line rate with and without security function. Finally we deploy the NetSecu platform in multiple sites, where our design is fully demonstrated and tested.","","978-1-61284-312-4","","10.1109/CMC.2011.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5931125","Java;click router;collaborative security;network security;overlay network","Collaboration;Hardware;IP networks;Java;Linux;Probes;Security","Java;computer network security;groupware","DDoS attack;Java;NetSecu;central management site;click router;collaborative network security platform;collaborative traffic control;in-network security;malicious attacks;network security appliances;overlay network security","","4","","10","","","18-20 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Biological information processing systems have various interesting characteristics from an engineering viewpoint. Among them, the immune system plays an important role in maintaining its own system against dynamically changing environments. Based on this fact, we have investigated a new decentralized consensus-making system for the behavior of autonomous mobile robots, inspired by the immune idiotypic network hypothesis in immunology. The developmental encoding scheme is used to translate a given genotype into a complete agent, which then acts in a physically-realistic virtual environment. Evolution is accomplished using a genetic algorithm, in which the genotypes are treated as genetic regula- tory networks. The dynamics of the regulatory network direct the growth of the agent, and lead to the construction of both the morphology and neural control of the agent. We demonstrate that such a model can be used to evolve agents to perform non-trivial tasks, such as directed locomotion and block pushing in a noisy environment.","","0-7803-9487-9","","10.1109/CEC.2006.1688334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688334","","Biological information theory;Encoding;Evolution (biology);Genetic algorithms;Immune system;Information processing;Maintenance engineering;Mobile robots;Morphology;Virtual environment","genetic algorithms;mobile robots","autonomous mobile robots;bio-inspired agent system;decentralized consensus-making system;developmental encoding scheme;dynamic environments;evolutionary agent systems;evolutionary metaphor;genetic algorithm;genetic regulatory networks;genotypes;immune idiotypic network hypothesis;immune system;immunology;neural control","","1","","12","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address such security challenges, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to detect the malicious attackers before they can accomplish any significant damages to the network. The IDS includes End-to-end feedbacks, Monitoring in promiscuous mode (watchdog), Activity-based overhearing and Reputation based solution. The proposed mechanism, states the adoption of hybrid cryptography techniques to reduce the network overhead, this also solves significant problems of Watchdog mechanism such as receiver collision, partial dropping, limited transmission power and false misbehavior report. A new key exchange mechanism called Instant Key Generation Mechanism (IKGM) is introduced here to eliminate the predistributed keys requirement. Here the key encryption is done at every node to increase the performances against contemporary approaches.

Each record in training data was obtained with 2 sec intervals from network traffic. Then Fuzzy classification rules have been obtained from training data by data mining and fuzzy logic.

UnC may be used in parallel with the existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem to provide an additional validation step for certificates offered by the PKI model. Leveraging the properties of the Internet infrastructure combined with cooperation from other hosts that act as notaries, UnC attests to the stability of certificates in time and space. By uniting notaries, UnC overwhelms and outnumbers attackers, and it uses this unity to conquer attack plots. Unlike existing proposals aimed to incorporate accountability into the Internet, UnC does not require external certificate hierarchies or certificate authorities to manage digital certificates. UnC can also be integrated in the Secure DNS (DNSSEC) protocols as well as the Secure BGP (S-BGP) protocol to eliminate the need for external key structures while protecting bindings between the entities and their IP addresses, and the integrity of the routing tables between Autonomous Systems. This paper describes the UnC architecture in detail, including the actions of each different kind of participant. It describes how UnC deals with well-known attack models, which are readily available on the Internet.The major contribution of this work is to open up a new door for the research community to exploit the predominance of good nodes over malicious ones in order to enhance the security of the PKI ecosystem and the Internet.","","","","10.1109/ICITST.2013.6750195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750195","Internet architecture;PKI infrastructure;geographic clusters;notary nodes;security;self-certifying addresses","Artificial neural networks;IP networks;Indexes;Internet;Public key;Publishing","Internet;public key cryptography","DNSSEC protocols;Internet unite-and-conquer architecture;PKI model;S-BGP protocol;UnC architecture;public key infrastructure ecosystem;secure BGP protocol;secure DNS protocols;self-certifying mechanism","","0","","41","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To obtain the optimal scheme of combining continuous authentication and IDSs in a distributed manner, we formulate the problem as a partially observable distributed stochastic system.

Application-level bugs are more frequent than kernel-level bugs, and, therefore, applications are often the means to compromise the security of a system. Detecting these attacks can be difficult, especially in the case of attacks that exploit application-logic errors. These attacks seldom exhibit characterizing patterns as in the case of buffer overflows and format string attacks. In addition, the data used by intrusion detection systems is either too low-level, as in the case of system calls, or incomplete, as in the case of syslog entries. This paper presents a technique to enforce nonbypassable, application-level auditing that does not require the recompilation of legacy systems. The technique is implemented as a kernel-level component, a privileged daemon, and an offline language tool. The technique uses binary rewriting to instrument applications so that meaningful and complete audit information can be extracted. This information is then matched against application-specific signatures to detect attacks that exploit application-logic errors. The technique has been successfully applied to detect attacks against widely-deployed applications, including the Apache Web server and the OpenSSH server.","1063-9527","0-7695-2252-1","","10.1109/CSAC.2004.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377227","","Application software;Buffer overflow;Computer bugs;Computer errors;Computer science;Computer security;Data mining;Instruments;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","Internet;digital signatures;operating system kernels;program debugging;security of data;software maintenance","Apache Web server;OpenSSH server;application-level auditing;application-level bugs;application-logic errors;application-specific signatures;binary rewriting;buffer overflows;host security;intrusion detection systems;legacy systems;offline language tool;operating system kernel;syslog entries;system calls","","1","2","38","","","6-10 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Over the past few years, mobile devices have become the most popular form of communication around the world. However, bundled together with the good and advanced capabilities of the mobile technology, mobile devices can also be used to perform various activities that may be of malicious intent or criminal in nature. This makes mobile devices a valuable source of digital evidence. For this reason, the technological evolution of mobile devices has raised the need to develop standardised investigation process models and procedures within the field of digital forensics. This need further supports the fact that forensic examiners and investigators face challenges when performing data acquisition in a forensically sound manner from mobile devices. This paper, therefore, aims at testing the harmonised digital forensic investigation process through a case study of a mobile forensic investigation. More specifically, an experiment was conducted that aims at testing the performance of the harmonised digital forensic investigation process (HDFIP) as stipulated in the ISO/IEC 27043 draft international standard through the extraction of potential digital evidence from mobile devices.","","978-1-4799-3383-9","","10.1109/ISSA.2014.6950491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950491","Harmonised Digital Forensic Investigation Process (HDFIP);ISO/IEC 27043;mobile device;mobile forensics","ISO standards;Performance evaluation","digital forensics;mobile computing","ISO/IEC 27043 draft international standard;data acquisition;harmonised digital forensic investigation;mobile device;mobile forensics;mobile technology","","0","","32","","","13-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its generic and interoperable structure based on the modern Web technologies, the protocol can be applied to risk assessment and evaluation of a multitude type of systems. The protocol consists of a secure communication architecture associated with each asset a security profile, and software services and agents that communicate over the Internet and other open networks. The secure communication architecture uses a secure exchange protocol incorporating the fast elliptic curve cryptography.

For applications using resource-restricted RFID tags and mobile hand-held readers, however, various risks could threaten their abilities to provide essential services to users. High mobility of the RFID system components and the open nature make an RFID system vulnerable to various attacks. Currently, although some techniques exist that might help improve survivability; there is still no complete proposal on survivability of an RFID system despite its growing popularity and importance in many applications. In this paper, we study survivability issues related to RFID systems and survey existing techniques whose usability and adaptability toward survivability would be beneficial.

The anomaly detection system monitors the attribute value pairs of successful HTTP requests received by webserver applications and automatically creates parameter profiles.

Variability in this metric has a significant influence on the ability of a detection system to reliably detect the presence of attacks.

However, the unpredictable context in which the system runs and daily emergence of new software threats makes it extremely challenging to diagnose anomalies using current tools. Host-based anomaly detection techniques can facilitate the diagnosis of unknown anomalies but there is no common platform with the implementation of such techniques. In this paper, we propose an automated anomaly detection framework (Total ADS) that automatically trains different anomaly detection techniques on a normal trace stream from a software system, raise anomalous alarms on suspicious behaviour in streams of trace data, and uses visualization to facilitate the analysis of the cause of the anomalies. Total ADS is an extensible Eclipse-based open source framework that employs a common trace format to use different types of traces, a common interface to adapt to a variety of anomaly detection techniques (e.g., HMM, sequence matching, etc.). Our case study on a modern Linux server shows that Total ADS automatically detects attacks on the server, shows anomalous paths in traces, and provides forensic insights.","","","","10.1109/SCAM.2014.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975641","Anomaly Detection;Software Security;Trace Analysis","Engines;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Linux;Servers;Testing;Training","digital forensics;public domain software;software fault tolerance;software maintenance","TotalADS;automated anomaly detection framework;automated software anomaly detection system;daily emergence;execution traces;extensible Eclipse-based open source framework;forensic insights;host-based anomaly detection;modern Linux server;normal trace stream;software system;software threats;system administrators resort;system scanners","","0","","27","","","28-29 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The difficulty to define the filtering rules lies where normal and anomaly packets have to be distinguished in incoming packets. The purpose of our research is to explore the early detective method for anomaly accesses based on statistic analysis. In this paper, we defined the chi-square method, and then analyze the all amount of incoming packets to our College focusing on the source IP address using chi-square method. As the results, we were able to extract the following features. Firstly, the number of packets was the more suitable scale of the window in the chi-square method than the time scale. Secondly, the setting of the window size with 500 packets and 2 bins made the detection of the DoS attacks within 10 minutes for DNS packets possible. Finally, we verified that the DoS attacks from the same source IP address was detected using the chi-square method.","","978-1-4244-3569-2","978-0-7695-3575-3","10.1109/CISIS.2009.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066799","Anomaly access;Chi-square method;DNS;DoS attacks","Competitive intelligence;Computer crime;Educational institutions;Filtering;Information security;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Software systems;Testing;Web server","IP networks;authorisation;statistical analysis;telecommunication security","DoS attack;IP packet;access filtering mechanism;chi-square method;denial of service attack;intrusion detection system;statistic analysis","","1","","7","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This introduces increased potential for innovation in networking from performance-enhanced to energy-efficient designs. In SDN, the application connects with the network via the SDN controller. A specific concern relating to this communication channel is whether an application can be trusted or not. For example, what information about the network state is gathered by the application? Is this information necessary for the application to execute or is it gathered for malicious intent? In this paper we present an approach to secure the northbound interface by introducing a permissions system that ensures that controller operations are available to trusted applications only.

Mobile Networks have been implemented in order to serve these needs. Unfortunately there are many users who want to use the benefits that technology gives to them for malicious and/or illegal actions. In this paper we present and analyze a hypothetical (but realistic) cyber crime investigation scenario. According to this, a user who has wireless internet access using a mobile phone through a University's network facilities, visits sites with pornographic content. A fact that complicates the analysis of the scenario is that the user employs anti-forensics techniques (e.g. data encryption). In this paper we show how to apply to the investigation of this scenario (as well as similar ones) a number of widely available open source forensics analysis tools overcoming the anti-forensics efforts of malicious users. Our goal is to demonstrate their applicability to cyber-crime forensics and their capability to operate in a complementary, to each other, way so that their deployment sheds light to different aspects of the case at hand.","","978-1-4673-2497-7","","10.1109/ASONAM.2012.165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425641","anti-forensics;computer forensics tools;malicious activities;malware attacks on mobile phones","Computers;Educational institutions;Encryption;Forensics;Malware;Mobile handsets","Internet;computer crime;cryptography;digital forensics;educational institutions;mobile computing;mobile radio;public domain software;smart phones;telecommunication security","antiforensics technique;cyber-crime forensics;data encryption;illegal action;malicious action;malicious user;mobile network;mobile phone user malicious activities;open source forensics analysis tool;open source tool;pornographic content;smart mobile phone;university network facility;wireless internet access","","1","","10","","","26-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Black hole attacks are potentially devastating attacks on wireless sensor networks in which a malicious node uses spurious route updates to attract network traffic that it then drops. We propose a robust and flexible attack detection scheme that uses a watchdog mechanism and lightweight expert system on each node to detect anomalies in the behaviour of neighbouring nodes. Using this scheme, even if malicious nodes are inserted into the network, good nodes will be able to identify them based on their behaviour as inferred from their network traffic. We examine the resource-preserving mechanisms of our system using simulations and demonstrate that we can allow groups of nodes to collectively evaluate network traffic and identify attacks while respecting the limited hardware resources (processing, memory and storage) that are typically available on wireless sensor network nodes.","","","","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835013","","Cryptography;Expert systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","expert systems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","autonomous self-organizing low-power nodes;black hole attacks;flexible attack detection scheme;lightweight expert system;malicious node;network traffic;node-resident expert systems;resource-preserving mechanisms;spurious route updates;watchdog mechanism;wireless sensor networks","","0","","20","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BDI (belief-desire-intention) model is a well studied architecture of agency for intelligent agents situated in complex and dynamic environments. Traditional MAS-based distributed IDSs commonly do their detection work within a framework that employs the method of distributed data collection and hierarchical data analysis. This is a simple and strict method, but it restricts the characteristic of distributing, intelligence and real-time response badly.

However, normal operation often produces traffic that matches likely ""attack signature"", resulting in false alarms. One main drawback is the inability of detecting new attacks which do not have known signatures. In this paper we propose an intrusion detection method that proposes rough set based feature selection heuristics and using fuzzy ants for clustering data. Rough set has to decrease the amount of data and get rid of redundancy. Fuzzy ants clustering methods allow objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership.

To overcome this bottleneck, today's network processors can utilize a wide-range of mechanisms - such as multi-level memory hierarchy, wide-word accesses, special-purpose result-caches, asynchronous memory, and hardware multi-threading. However, supporting all of these mechanisms complicates programmability and hardware design, and wastes system resources. In this paper, we address the following fundamental question: what minimal set of hardware mechanisms must a network processor support to achieve the twin goals of simplified programmability and high packet throughput? We show that no single mechanism sufficies; the minimal set must include data-caches and multi-threading. Data-caches and multi-threading are complementary; whereas data- caches exploit locality to reduce the number of context-switches and the off-chip memory bandwidth requirement, multi-threading exploits parallelism to hide long cache-miss latencies.","","978-1-59593-082-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675260","data-caches;multithreading;network processors","Application software;Bandwidth;Delay;Hardware;Internetworking;Multithreading;Network address translation;Parallel processing;Permission;Throughput","internetworking;multi-threading","asynchronous memory;hardware multi-threading;memory access overhead;memory wall;multi-level memory hierarchy;network processor;off-chip memory bandwidth requirement;packet processing;special-purpose result-caches;wide-word accesses","","6","3","42","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once caught in the honeypot, the blackhat leaves many fingerprints behind: network (information gathering scans, IRC chats, mail, etc) and system activity (what he did on the system, which tools he used, etc). The aim of honeypot forensics is to identify these fingerprints as part of the evidence gathering process. We present a methodology that will help the analyst to achieve this goal. The first step is to analyze the honeypot's ingress and egress network traffic. The second one is to look at the actions performed by the blackhat and the tools he used on the honeypot.

One difficult class of attack to defend against is user-initiated malicious software (malware) execution. User-initiated malware penetrates the security perimeter with assistance provided, either intentionally or unintentionally, by and enterprise's end users. These users assist the attacker by downloading malware from a Web site, invoking malware arriving as e-mail attachments and introducing malware inside the perimeter via the unauthorized use of foreign media, e.g., floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or unauthorized media devices, e.g., USB drives, or unauthorized wireless networking hardware. In this paper, we describe characteristics of the most widely used defense techniques for the blocking of user-initiated malware and why these techniques are insufficient. We then introduce a module verification strategy that eliminates, or at least severely reduce, this problem by extending the classic ""defense in depth"" network security strategy. We then describe how the augmentation of a standard operating system loader to include references to a database of cryptographic hashes of module executables can be used to implement this strategy.

However, virtualization also makes it a target for potent rootkits because of the loss of control problem over the hosted Virtual Machines (VMs). This makes traditional in-guest security solutions, relying on operating system kernel trustworthiness, no longer an effective solution to secure the virtual infrastructure of the IaaS model. In this paper, we explore briefly the security problem of the IaaS cloud computing model, and present CloudSec, a new virtualization-aware monitoring appliance that provides active, transparent and real-time security monitoring for hosted VMs in the IaaS model. CloudSec utilizes virtual machine introspection techniques to provide fine-grained inspection of VM's physical memory without installing any monitoring code inside the VM. It actively reconstructs and monitors the dynamically changing kernel data structures instances, as a prior step to enable providing protection for kernel data structures. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype using VMsafe libraries on a VMware ESX platform. We have evaluated the system monitoring accuracy and the performance overhead of CloudSec.","","978-1-4577-0458-1","","10.1109/ICNSS.2011.6059967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059967","Cloud Computing;IaaS Security;Semantic Gap;VMsafe APIs;VMware ESX;Virtual Appliance;Virtual Machine Introspection","Data structures;Kernel;Memory management;Monitoring;Security;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;data structures;operating system kernels;security of data;virtual machines","CloudSec;VM physical memory;VMsafe libraries;VMware ESX platform;fine grained inspection;in-guest security solutions;infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing model;kernel data structures;operating system kernel trustworthiness;security monitoring appliance;virtual machine introspection techniques;virtualization;virtualization aware monitoring appliance","","10","","27","","","6-8 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often provide such low-level, difficult to comprehend information. This paper details a Human Interface for Security Awareness (HISA) algorithm for interpreting cyber incident information to human operators from anomaly based intrusion detections systems. A similarity algorithm mapping anomaly results to signature based intrusion system rules is developed. Categorizations of attacks found in rules created for the Snort intrusion system were used as a basis of information to present to the user. A proof of concept system was developed using Perl native functions and custom modules. Testing with generated ICMP packets resulted in an identification accuracy of 60% proving the efficacy of the presented HISA algorithm.","","978-1-4244-3959-1","978-1-4244-3960-7","10.1109/HSI.2009.5091055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5091055","command and control systems;site security monitoring","Communication system control;Communication system security;Computer security;Control systems;Humans;Information security;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Safety","digital signatures;security of data;traffic information systems;user interfaces","cyber security anomaly detection system;digital signature;human interface;intrusion detection system;network traffic information system;security awareness;snort intrusion system;user interface","","1","","18","","","21-23 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A high throughput string matching architecture for intrusion detection and prevention","Lin Tan; Sherwood, T.","Dept. of Comput.

Proceedings. 32nd International Symposium on","20050620","2005","","","112","122","Network intrusion detection and prevention systems have emerged as one of the most effective ways of providing security to those connected to the network, and at the heart of almost every modern intrusion detection system is a string matching algorithm. String matching is one of the most critical elements because it allows for the system to make decisions based not just on the headers, but the actual content flowing through the network. Unfortunately, checking every byte of every packet to see if it matches one of a set of ten thousand strings becomes a computationally intensive task as network speeds grow into the tens, and eventually hundreds, of gigabits/second. To keep up with these speeds a specialized device is required, one that can maintain tight bounds on worst case performance, that can be updated with new rules without interrupting operation, and one that is efficient enough that it could be included on chip with existing network chips or even into wireless devices. We have developed an approach that relies on a special purpose architecture that executes novel string matching algorithms specially optimized for implementation in our design. We show how the problem can be solved by converting the large database of strings into many tiny state machines, each of which searches for a portion of the rules and a portion of the bits of each rule. Through the careful co-design and optimization of our architecture with a new string matching algorithm we show that it is possible to build a system that is 10 times more efficient than the currently best known approaches.","1063-6897","0-7695-2270-X","","10.1109/ISCA.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431550","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Computer science;Computer security;Databases;Heart;Intrusion detection;Network-on-a-chip;Protection;Throughput","computer architecture;optimisation;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","network chips;network intrusion detection;network prevention system;network security;network speed;string matching architecture;wireless device","","16","30","31","","","4-8 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to establish efficient key management in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a challenging problem for the constrained energy, memory, and computational capabilities of the sensor nodes.

Recent researches have shown that using asymmetric key cryptography in heterogeneous sensor networks (HSN) can improve network performance, such as connectivity, resilience, etc. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography, the paper propose an efficient and hybrid key management method for heterogeneous wireless sensor network, cluster heads and base stations use public key encryption method based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), while using symmetric encryption method between adjacent nodes in the cluster.

We focus on the early detection of behavioral patterns of malware families rather than the detection of malware binary signatures. Upon detection of an attack, an alarm is raised and the damage that can be caused by the detected malware type is estimated.

Advancements in sensor networks enable a wide range of environmental monitoring and object tracking applications. Secure routing in sensor networks is a difficult problem due to the resources limitations in WSN. Moreover, multihop routing in WSN is affected by new nodes constantly entering/leaving the system. Therefore, biologically inspired algorithms are reviewed and enhanced to tackle problems arise in WSN. Ant routing and human security has shown an excellent performance for sensor networks. Certain parameters like energy level, link quality, lose rate are considered while making decisions. These decisions will come up with the optimal route and also to take best action against the security attacks. In this paper, the design and initial work on biological-inspired self-organized secure autonomous routing algorithm for sensor networks are presented.

In this paper, a new method has been proposed to detect novelty and handle concept drift with limited required memory and storage space. The method is based on clustering algorithm. It uses Discrete Cosine Transform to build compact generative models which are then used to detect novel classes and concept drift effectively. The proposed method has been evaluated with seven common data sets from various domains.
