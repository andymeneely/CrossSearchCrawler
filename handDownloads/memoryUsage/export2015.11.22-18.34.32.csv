The recently discovered security attacks like W32.Stuxnet and the Duqu worm changed this almost established belief. Further, usual methods of anomaly detection cannot simply be employed in embedded systems since they are usually resource-constrained and the detection methods might interfere with performance of the main system tasks. However, behavior of applications running in embedded systems is relatively known, and profiling the correct behavior and comparing it with the runtime behavior is accounted as an effective approach for anomaly detection with no such interferences. In this paper, we consider the inter-effects of processor temperature and power consumption of embedded systems, and present a novel technique to detect malicious activities with minor delays with respect to the occurrences. This is done through analyzing the simultaneously observed power and temperature of the processor. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by using the power and temperature traces of a real processor obtained through detailed simulations.","","","","10.1109/ISCISC.2014.6994033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994033","X2-distance;anomaly detection;clustering;power trace;profiling;temperature trace","Embedded systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Power demand;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","computer crime;embedded systems;invasive software;power consumption;safety-critical software","Duqu worm;W32.Stuxnet;anomaly detection;embedded systems;malicious activities detection;power consumption;power monitoring;processor power;processor temperature inter-effects;runtime behavior;security attacks;security violations;temperature monitoring","","0","","20","","","3-4 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Ethernet switch or router with a network processor can be a solution for these requirements. Also, the Gigabit Ethernet switch is already being deployed in large numbers in both corporate and public data networks, and has begun to move Ethernet from the region of the local area network out to encompass the metro aria network.

A Web service is defined as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network based on a set of XML standards. This new architecture and set of protocols brings new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. To prevent and detect such attacks, several security techniques are available like authentication and encryption mechanisms, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Nevertheless these security methods encounter some problems, especially when dealing with new attacks. Relying on additional security principles seems to be important to well protect Web services. In this paper, we propose using honeypots to detect and study attacks against Web services. Honeypots are used to learn new techniques, tools and motivations of hackers to better protect the production systems against attacks. Our solution (WS Honeypot) is to deploy a honeypot as a web service application.

In order to overcome these shortcomings of current intrusion detection techniques, a new distributed intrusion detection model based on mobile agent is proposed in this paper. Intelligent and mobile characteristics of the agent are used to make computing move to data. As mobile agent can only improve the structure of system and can not supply fundamental new detecting techniques, improved dynamic clonal selection algorithm and collaborative signal mechanism are adopted for reducing false positive rate and increasing detection rate in this paper. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm were simulated by KDDpsila99 datasets. Comparing with winning entry of KDDpsila99 classifier learning contest, the proposed model has low false positive rate and higher detection rate in both Dos and Probing attacks, and greatly higher detection rate in U2R attack.

"Network anomaly detection tools based on association rules","Othman, Z.A.; Eljadi, E.E.","Sch. of Comput. Sci., Univ.

Many organizations are faced with the problem of detecting whether or not they have an anomaly in their network transactions. The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is one of the popular tools used to secure and protect networks. In order to secure a network the signature rules in NIDS should be updated with the latest signature detection rule. Therefore, this research aims to develop a network anomaly detection tool which focuses on association rule data mining techniques to detect anomalies and also produce anomaly detection rules. The tool, named as NASSR, consists of the following functions: pre-processing of the raw data network transaction that is captured using Wireshark and transforming the data into three types of data sets (2, 5 and 10 seconds), normalization (min., max.) and mining (Appriori, Fuzzy Appriori, and FP-Growth). The anomaly detection is calculated by comparing it with a normal network data set, which is validated by CACE tools. The data set is determined as having no intrusion, if the similarity results are higher than the user threshold, and vice versa. This paper also presents the interface tools used to analyse the 7GB real network data set obtained from Pusat Teknologi Maklumat (PTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), which consists of three days' accumulation of network traffic data, and presents the data sets that have anomalies and their rules. The best result shows that the best technique for pre-processing is in the form of two seconds. Fuzzy Appriori presents the most accurate result while FP-growth has been shown as a faster mining technique. The tools can be easily used to detect anomalies for any network traffic.","2155-6822","978-1-4577-0753-7","","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021705","Association Rules Techniques;Data Mining;network intrusion detection system (NIDS)","Association rules;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Itemsets;User interfaces","computer network security;data mining","CACE tools;FP-growth;NASSR;Pusat Teknologi Maklumat;Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia;Wireshark;association rule data mining techniques;computer networks;data network transaction preprocessing;data transformation;fuzzy apriori;interface tools;network anomaly detection tools;network intrusion detection system;signature detection rule","","1","","25","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The GNP is based on directed graph, In this paper the security issues related to deploy a data mining-based IDS in a real time environment is focused upon. We generalize the problem of GNP with association rule mining and propose a fuzzy weighted association rule mining with GNP framework suitable for both continuous and discrete attributes. Our proposal follows an Apriori algorithm based fuzzy WAR and GNP and avoids pre and post processing thus eliminating the extra steps during rules generation.

Introducing objects into the control processes of complex systems makes IoT security very difficult to address. Indeed, the Internet of Things is a complex paradigm in which people interact with the technological ecosystem based on smart objects through complex processes. The interactions of these four IoT components, person, intelligent object, technological ecosystem, and process, highlight a systemic and cognitive dimension within security of the IoT. The interaction of people with the technological ecosystem requires the protection of their privacy. Similarly, their interaction with control processes requires the guarantee of their safety. Processes must ensure their reliability and realize the objectives for which they are designed. We believe that the move towards a greater autonomy for objects will bring the security of technologies and processes and the privacy of individuals into sharper focus. Furthermore, in parallel with the increasing autonomy of objects to perceive and act on the environment, IoT security should move towards a greater autonomy in perceiving threats and reacting to attacks, based on a cognitive and systemic approach. In this work, we will analyze the role of each of the mentioned actors in IoT security and their relationships, in order to highlight the research challenges and present our approach to these issues based on a holistic vision of IoT security.","","","","10.1109/ICCNC.2014.6785328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785328","","Context;Data privacy;Ecosystems;Privacy;Reliability;Safety;Security","Internet of Things;data privacy;security of data","IoT security;cognitive dimension;control processes;internet of things;object autonomy;privacy protection;safety guarantee;smart objects;systemic dimension;technological ecosystem","","0","","14","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in hostile environments, some nodes may deny to do so, either for saving their own resources or for intentionally disrupting regular communications. This type of misbehavior is generally referred to as packet dropping attack or black hole attack, which is considered as one of the most destructive attacks that leads to the network collapse. The special network characteristics, such as limited battery power and mobility, make the prevention techniques based on cryptographic primitives ineffective to cope with such attack. Rather, a more proactive alternative is required to ensure the safety of the forwarding function by staving off malicious nodes from being involved in routing paths. Once such scheme fails, some economic-based approaches can be adopted to alleviate the attack consequences by motivating the nodes cooperation. As a backup, detection and reaction schemes remain as the final defense line to identify the misbehaving nodes and punish them. In this paper, we make a comprehensive survey investigation on the state-of-the-art countermeasures to deal with the packet dropping attack. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that remain to be tackled by researchers for constructing an in-depth defense against such a sophisticated attack.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5556741","Ad Hoc Networks;Black Hole Attack;Packet Dropping Attack;Routing Protocols Security","Ad hoc networks;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols","cryptography;mobile ad hoc networks","MANET;attack consequences;backup schemes;black hole attack;cryptographic primitives;detection schemes;economic-based approaches;forwarding function;malicious nodes;misbehaving node identification;mobile ad hoc networks;network collapse;nodes cooperation;packet dropping attack;packet dropping problem mitigation;prevention techniques;proactive alternative;reaction schemes","","12","","51","","2010-08-23","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose our approach carefully places and caches the input text data and the reference pattern data used for pattern matching in the on-chip shared memories and the texture caches of the GPU. Furthermore, it efficiently schedules the off-chip global memory loads and the shared memory stores in order to minimize the overheads in loading the input data to the shared memories and also to minimize the shared memory bank conflicts. The proposed approach leads to a significant cut-down of the effective memory access latencies and leads to impressive performance improvements. Experimental results on Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 GPU show that our approach delivers up to 127Gbps throughput performance and up to 222-times speedup compared with a serial version running on 2.2Ghz Core2Duo Intel processor.","","978-0-7695-4979-8","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651081","Aho-Corasick algorithm;GPU;parallelization;shared-memory bank conflict","AC machines;Algorithm design and analysis;Doped fiber amplifiers;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Memory management;Pattern matching","graphics processing units;parallel processing;pattern matching","AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick algorithm;Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 GPU;graphic processing unit;high throughput parallel implementation;memory access latencies;memory hierarchy;off-chip global memory loads;on-chip parallelism;patterns matching algorithm","","1","","19","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that ""scene change analysis"" can reveal sudden changes in traffic behavior or anomalies.

However, they are still one of the most vulnerable parts of organizations infrastructure. Exploits are many times used by worms to fast propagate across the full Internet being Web servers one of their main targets. New exploit techniques have arouse in the last few years that have rendered useless traditional IDS techniques based on signature identification. Exploits use polymorphism (code encryption) and metamorphism (code obfuscation) to evade detection from signature-based IDSs. In this paper, we address precisely the topic of how to protect Web servers against zero-day (new), polymorphic, and metamorphic malware embedded in data streams (requests) that target Web servers. We rely on a novel technique to detect harmful binary code injection (i.e., exploits) in HTTP requests that is more efficient than current techniques based on binary code emulation or instrumentation of virtual engines. The detection of exploits is done through sandbox processes. The technique is complemented by another set of techniques such as caching, and pooling, to reduce its cost to neglectable levels.Our technique has little assumptions regarding the exploit unlike previous approaches that assume the existence of sled or getPC code, loops, read of the payload, writes to different addresses, etc. The evaluation shows that caching is highly effective and that the average latency introduced by our system is neglectable.","1060-9857","978-0-7695-3826-6","","10.1109/SRDS.2009.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283421","exploit;metamorphic malware;polymorphic malware;vulnerability;web server;zero-day malware","Binary codes;Computer worms;Cryptography;Emulation;Instruments;Internet;Intrusion detection;Protection;Search engines;Web server","Internet;cache storage;cryptography;digital signatures;file servers;invasive software;telecommunication security","HTTP request;Internet;PolyVaccine;Web server protection;binary code emulation;cache storage;code encryption;code obfuscation;harmful binary code injection detection;malware;metamorphic exploit;polymorphic exploit;sandbox process;signature-based IDS;virtual engine instrumentation;worms;zero-day exploit","","1","1","36","","","27-30 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The currently available intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability, and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a distributed architecture with autonomous and cooperating agents without any central analysis component. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in design of an IDS in terms of scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. We have developed a proof-of-concept prototype, and conducted experiments on the system. The results show the effectiveness of our system in detecting intrusive activities in any network of workstations.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276474","","Computer architecture;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault tolerance;Independent component analysis;Intrusion detection;Real time systems;Scalability","multi-agent systems;security of data","computer systems;cooperating agents;distributed architectures;distributed intrusion detection system;distributed nodes;fault tolerance;security mechanism","","1","","14","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this is not the case, as several examples of successful attacks carried out in the last decade, and more frequently in the very recent past, have dramatically shown. Experts in this area know very well that often the peculiarities of industrial networks prevent the adoption of classical approaches to their security and, in particular, of those popular solutions that are mainly based on a detect and patch philosophy. This paper is a contribution, from the security point of view, to the assessment of the current situation of a wide class of industrial distributed computing systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper takes into account the process of ensuring a satisfactory degree of security for a distributed industrial system, with respect to some key elements such as the system characteristics, the current state of the art of standardization and the adoption of suitable controls (countermeasures) that can help in lowering the security risks below a predefined, acceptable threshold.","1551-3203","","","10.1109/TII.2012.2198666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198335","Industrial networks;information security;network security;risk assessment;security analysis and monitoring;security countermeasures","Availability;Guidelines;NIST;Process control;Risk management;Security;Servers","computer network security;production engineering computing;risk management","Information and Communication Technology;cyber threat;detect-and-patch philosophy;distributed ICT infrastructure;general-purpose computer network protection;industrial computer network;industrial distributed computing system;security countermeasure;security issues;security risk","","17","","105","","2012-05-10","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In contrast to traditional monitoring, neither the data location nor the data format needs to be known to the invoking process, which simplifies application development, but requires an efficient search plane inside the managed system. The search plane is realized as a network of search nodes that process search queries in a distributed fashion. This paper introduces matching and ranking for network search queries. We are proposing a semantic for matching and ranking, which is configurable to support different types of management applications-from exact matching for database-style queries to loose, approximate matching, which is appropriate for exploratory purposes. We describe an echo protocol for efficient distributed query processing that supports matching and ranking. Further, we present the design of a search node, which maintains a real-time database of operational information and allows for parallel processing of search queries. A prototype implementation on a cloud testbed shows that the network search system, on a 9-node cluster with 24 core servers, executes 200 global search queries/sec with the 75th percetile latency below 100 milliseconds and with a CPU utilization below 5%. The performance measurements, together with our design, suggest that a system of 100,000 servers processing the same load would exhibit the same overhead per server and a query latency of below 1 sec.","","","","10.1109/CNSM.2013.6727844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727844","Network search;distributed management;distributed query processing;innetwork management;matching and ranking","Databases;Measurement;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Search problems;Semantics;Web search","cloud computing;query processing","distributed query processing;echo protocol;network search queries;parallel processing;scalable matching;scalable ranking;search node","","1","","28","","","14-18 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The architecture of multi-agent in depth defence based on immune principle is proposed. The agents of intrusion detection detect all intrusion which passes by the agent, including known and unknown. The information of new intrusion, which gotten from current monitored network is encapsulated and sent to the other network as vaccine by mobile agents. So the other network can prevent the same intrusion. Intrusion packets are prevented from gateway of intrusion source by response agent. The experimental results show that the new model actualizes an active and distributed prevention policy than that of the traditional passive intrusion prevention systems.","","978-0-7695-3744-3","","10.1109/IAS.2009.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284187","Artificial Immune System;IDS;Multi-Agents;Vaccine","Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Immune system;Information processing;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Monitoring","artificial immune systems;biocomputing;data encapsulation;mobile agents;multi-agent systems;security of data","artificial immune system;associative retrieval;biology immune system;defence system;distributed intelligent computation;encapsulation;information processing;mobile agents;modern immunology;multi-agent architecture;parallel intelligent computation;passive intrusion prevention system","","1","","6","","","18-20 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an NIDS, the most important and time-consuming processes are pattern matching and deep inspection of the header and the body of packets. Several analyses show that this process can take up to 75% of the time of processing packets. In this paper, relying on the processing power of general purpose graphics cards - which seem to be a better option compared to other hardware technologies like FPGAs with regard to speed, scalability, flexibility, ease of programming and price - and with the idea of having the signature-based detection engine of NIDS systems run on GPU rather than CPU, it is tried to present an efficient method to increase the speed of intrusion detection systems such as Snort. The proposed method provides a means to perform payload matching and non-payload matching of packets in a parallel platform on GPU, which can speed up the signature-based detection engine of Snort 3.6.","","","","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599567","Attack Signatures;Graphics Card;Network Intrusion Detection Systems;Pattern Matching;Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays;Graphics;Graphics processing units;Pattern matching;Payloads;Throughput","Internet;computer network security;graphics processing units;parallel processing;pattern matching","FPGAs;Internet threats;NIDS;Snort 3.6;attack signature matching;general purpose graphics cards;graphics processors;hardware technologies;high-performance intrusion detection systems;network communications;network intrusion detection systems;packet body inspection;packet header inspection;parallel platform;pattern matching;payload matching;signature-based detection engine;time-consuming evaluation","","0","","14","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, they are relatively vulnerable to malicious network attacks, and therefore, security is a more significant issue than infrastructure-based wireless networks. In MANETs, it is difficult to identify malicious hosts as the topology of the network dynamically changes. A malicious host can easily interrupt a route for which it is one of the forming nodes in the communication path. In the literature, there are several proposals to detect such malicious hosts inside the network. In those methods, a baseline profile, which is defined as per static training data, is usually used to verify the identity and the topology of the network, thus preventing any malicious host from joining the network. Since the topology of a MANET dynamically changes, the mere use of a static baseline profile is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a new anomaly-detection scheme based on a dynamic learning process that allows the training data to be updated at particular time intervals. Our dynamic learning process involves calculating the projection distances based on multidimensional statistics using weighted coefficients and a forgetting curve. We use the network simulator 2 (ns-2) system to conduct the MANET simulations and consider scenarios for detecting five types of attacks. The simulation results involving two different networks in size show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","0018-9545","","","10.1109/TVT.2008.2010049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689379","Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV);anomaly detection;dynamic learning;forgetting curve;malicious attacks;mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs);projection distance","","ad hoc networks;mobile computing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","MANET;anomaly detection;malicious network attacks;mobile ad hoc networks;network simulator 2;network topology","","27","","45","","2008-11-25","Jun 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The human body selectively reflects, diffracts and scatters the radio signal which affects the received signal strength. This paper presents an approach to detecting human activity using fluctuations in the received signal strength. These fluctuations are detected using an overcomplete dictionary based pattern recognition algorithm. Performance results are presented which show that the proposed system has an accuracy of 86% in detecting human activity.

The state-of-the-art approach for network monitoring and analysis involves storage and analysis of network flow statistic. However, this approach loses much valuable information within the Internet traffic. With the advancement of commodity hardware, in particular the volume of storage devices and the speed of interconnect technologies used in network adapter cards and multi-core processors, it is now possible to capture 10 Gbps and beyond real-time network traffic using a commodity computer, such as n2disk. Also with the advancement of distributed file system (such as Hadoop, ZFS, etc.) and open cloud computing platform (such as OpenStack, CloudStack, and Eucalyptus, etc.), it is practical to store such large volume of traffic data and fully in-depth analyse the inside communication within an acceptable latency. In this paper, based on wellknown TimeMachine, we present TIFAflow, the design and implementation of a novel system for archiving and querying network flows. Firstly, we enhance the traffic archiving system named TImemachine+FAstbit (TIFA) with flow granularity, i.e., supply the system with flow table and flow module. Secondly, based on real network traces, we conduct performance comparison experiments of TIFAflow with other implementations such as common database solution, TimeMachine and TIFA system. Finally, based on comparison results, we demonstrate that TIFAflow has a higher performance improvement in storing and querying performance than TimeMachine and TIFA, both in time and space metrics.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574679","NoSQL;bitmap database;cloud computing;forensic analysis;hadoop distributed file system;network security;phishing attack;traffic archival","Cloud computing;Forensics;Internet;Network security;Real-time systems;Telecommunication traffic","","","","2","","","","","August 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

However, they have the shortcoming that there are undetectable intrusions according to types for each measure and modeling method because each intrusion type results in anomalies. We propose a multiple-measure intrusion detection method to remedy this drawback of conventional anomaly detectors. We measure normal behavior by system calls, resource usage and file access events and build up profiles for normal behavior with a hidden Markov model, statistical method and rule-base method, which are integrated with a rule-based approach.

Although VPN technology is very useful, it imposes security threats on the remote network because its firewall does not know what traffic is flowing inside the VPN tunnel. To address this issue, we propose VGuard, a framework that allows a policy owner and a request owner to collaboratively determine whether the request satisfies the policy without the policy owner knowing the request and the request owner knowing the policy. We first present an efficient protocol, called Xhash, for oblivious comparison, which allows two parties, where each party has a number, to compare whether they have the same number, without disclosing their numbers to each other. Then, we present the VGuard framework that uses Xhash as the basic building block. The basic idea of VGuard is to first convert a firewall policy to nonoverlapping numerical rules and then use Xhash to check whether a request matches a rule. Comparing with the Cross-Domain Cooperative Firewall (CDCF) framework, which represents the state-of-the-art, VGuard is not only more secure but also orders of magnitude more efficient. On real-life firewall policies, for processing packets, our experimental results show that VGuard is three to four orders of magnitude faster than CDCF.","1045-9219","","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5557862","Virtual private networks;network security.;privacy","Computers;Encryption;IP networks;Privacy;Protocols;Servers;Virtual private networks","authorisation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;protocols;virtual private networks","VGuard framework;VPN technology;Xhash protocol;cross-domain cooperative firewall;encryption tunnel;firewall policy;privacy preserving collaborative enforcement;virtual private networks","","5","","16","","2010-08-26","May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Malicious executables are analyzed using two approaches: disassembly, utilizing IDA-Pro, and the application of a dedicated state machine in order to obtain the set of functions comprising the executables. The signature extraction process is based on a comparison with a common function repository. By eliminating functions appearing in the common function repository from the signature candidate list, F-Sign can minimize the risk of false-positive detection errors. To minimize false-positive rates even further, F-Sign proposes intelligent candidate selection using an entropy score to generate signatures. Evaluation of F-Sign was conducted under various conditions. The findings suggest that the proposed method can be used for automatically generating signatures that are both specific and sensitive.","1094-6977","","","10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2068544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5585792","Automatic signature generation (ASG);malware;malware filtering","Binary codes;Grippers;Libraries;Malware;Monitoring;Real time systems;Software","digital signatures;error detection;finite state machines;invasive software","F-sign;IDA-Pro;automatic extraction;automatic signature generation;common function repository;deep packet inspection;entropy score;false positive detection error;function-based signature generation;high speed network traffic filtering device;intelligent candidate selection;malware;signature candidate list;signature extraction process;state machine","","1","","38","","2010-09-27","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Being based on a set of rules, i.e., attack signatures, the accuracy and reliability of IDS detection heavily depend on the quality of the employed rule set. In this context, any conflicts that arise between rules create ambiguity in classification of network traffic or host events, not only affecting the performance of IDS, but also putting the system in a vulnerable position. Currently existing techniques for conflict detection focus primarily on the security policy of the network devices: IPSec, routers, firewalls. In this paper we address the conflict detection in host and network-based intrusion detection and response devices and present a rule management framework that allows rule set analysis for potential conflicts. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach on three collections of attack signatures: the set provided by the vendor of the commercial IDS and the rule sets of the open source Snort IDS and bleeding edge threats. Our analysis reveal conflicts in each of them.","","978-1-4244-5344-3","978-0-7695-3805-1","10.1109/CONGRESS.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5341717","attack signitures;intrusion detection","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Computer security;Event detection;Hemorrhaging;Intrusion detection;Niobium;Payloads;Privacy;Telecommunication traffic","knowledge based systems;security of data","bleeding edge threat;conflict detection;open source Snort IDS;rule management framework;rule misconfiguration classification;rule misconfiguration discovery;signature-based intrusion detection","","2","","21","","","25-27 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, an open problem is how to develop efficient mechanisms that can be incorporated with sleep-wake protocols to ensure both long-lived operation and a high degree of security. Our contribution in this paper is to address this problem by using local monitoring, a powerful technique for detecting and mitigating control and data attacks in sensor networks. In local monitoring, each node oversees part of the traffic going in and out of its neighbors to determine if the behavior is suspicious, such as, unusually long delay in forwarding a packet. Here, we present a protocol called SLAM to make local monitoring parsimonious in its energy consumption and to integrate it with any extant sleep-wake protocol in the network. The challenge is to enable sleep-wake in a secure manner even in the face of nodes that may be adversarial and not wake up nodes responsible for monitoring its traffic. We prove analytically that the security coverage is not weakened by the protocol. We perform simulations in ns-2 to demonstrate that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged while listening energy saving of 30 to 129 times is achieved, depending on the network load.","","0-7695-2855-4","","10.1109/DSN.2007.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273007","Sensor networks;local monitoring;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna.","Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Cryptography;Delay;Monitoring;Protocols;Sensor systems and applications;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks","protocols;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless sensor networks","sensor networks;sleep-wake aware local monitoring;telecommunication traffic","","6","","30","","","25-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our previous work, we have developed an exclusive signature matching scheme that aims to identify a mismatch instead of locating an accurate match and achieved good results in the experiments. With the advent of Cloud Computing, IDS as a service (IDSaaS) has been proposed as an alternative by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud. In this paper, we attempt to design a parallel model to conduct the exclusive signature matching in a cloud. In the evaluation, we implemented our model in a cloud environment and investigated its performance compared with Snort.

Serving degraded content reduces strain on resources and enables them to cater for a larger set of clients. To that end, this paper studies adversarial exploits of dynamic content adaptation mechanisms to a new instantiation of reduction of quality (RoQ) attacks. The RoQ attack pattern is orchestrated to cause different forms of damage such as longer response time for legitimate clients, degraded content being served and underutilization of resources. We assess the impact of RoQ attacks via the potency metric which reflects the tradeoffs between the damage inflicted and the cost in mounting the attack.

Denial of service (DoS) attacks cause significant disruptions to the Internet, compounding the delay jitter and loss of packets that are used to transmit sensor measurements and control signals. Existing works have mainly focused on controller design under network normal operation, which might be inadequate to the threats of DoS attacks. In this paper, the authors present two mitigation measures from the viewpoint of network intrusion detection and response. The basic idea is that the routers close to the attack sources actively drop the attack traffic or lower-priority traffic to protect the resource for the legitimate application traffic. The simulation results indicate that the proposed defense measures are effective for ameliorating the NBCS performance degradation. We suggest that a plausible direction for the security of NBCS may combine the proposed network defense measures with specific controller design to compensate for delay jitter/packet loss.","","0-7803-8730-9","","10.1109/IECON.2004.1432165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432165","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Degradation;Jitter;Loss measurement;Niobium compounds;Stochastic systems;Traffic control;Web and internet services","Internet;authorisation;control system synthesis;delays;jitter;microcontrollers;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet;control signal transmission;delay jitter;denial of service attack;mitigating performance;network defense;network intrusion detection;network router;network traffic;network-based control system security;sensor measurement;stochastic delay","","1","","11","","","2-6 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Facing new application scenarios in cloud computing, the IDS approaches yield several problems since the operator of the IDS should be the user, not the administrator of the cloud infrastructure. Extensibility, efficient management, and compatibility to virtualization-based context need to be introduced into many existing IDS implementations.Additionally, the cloud providers need to enable possibilities to deploy and configure IDS for the user. Within this paper, we summarize several requirements for deploying IDS in the cloud and propose an extensible IDS architecture for being easily used in a distributed cloud infrastructure.","","978-0-7695-3929-4","978-1-4244-5421-1","10.1109/DASC.2009.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380611","Cloud Computing;IDS;IDS Management;Virtual Machine;Virtualization","Application software;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Network servers;Protection;Robustness;Virtual machining","Internet;security of data","IDS management;cloud computing;cloud providers;distributed IDS solutions;distributed cloud infrastructure;distributed environment;intrusion detection system;network communication;virtualization-based context compatibility","","26","1","24","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For wirespeed and secure network access, hardware solutions for packet classification are mandatory which can also sustain high throughput at low latency. Memory required for hardware architecture is also a crucial problem. In this paper, we have performed classification of packets using basic XNOR gate. We compare our proposed design with StrideBV which is one of efficient decomposition based technique for packet classification. The results obtained by synthesis and stimulation using XilinxISE Design tool 13.1 are presented in this paper.

A Zebu specification, based on the notation used in RFCs, describes protocol message formats and related processing constraints. Zebu-based applications are efficient, since message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Zebu-based applications are also robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation of the message structure. Using a message torture suite in the context of SIP and RTSP, we show that Zebu-generated code is both complete and defect-free.","1060-9857","0-7695-2995-X","","10.1109/SRDS.2007.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365692","","Computer bugs;Domain specific languages;IP networks;Network servers;Protocols;Robustness;Scattering;Standards development;Throughput;Web server","protocols","domain-specific languages;message processing;network application protocol implementations","","3","","19","","","10-12 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But current anomaly detectors monitor application behavior at a high level of detail, and many irrelevant variations in that behavior can cause false alarms. This paper discusses the preprocessing of audit data ultimately used by application-based anomaly detection systems. The goal is to create a more abstract picture of program behavior filtering out many irrelevant details. Our specific approach automatically identifies repeating sub-sequences of behavior events and sequences of events that always occur together. The main benefit of this preprocessing technique can be used with a wide variety of program-based anomaly detectors, but we present empirical results showing how it improves the performance of the well-known stide anomaly detection system.","","0-7695-1897-4","","10.1109/DISCEX.2003.1194881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194881","","Data analysis;Detectors;Filtering;Information analysis;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Object detection;Performance analysis;Vocabulary","auditing;security of data","application-based anomaly detection systems;application-based anomaly detectors;audit data preprocessing;baseline model;intrusion;normal application behavior;program behavior data vocabulary;repeating sub-sequences","","2","","27","","","22-24 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One way to deal with this problem is to filter unwanted traffic at the routers based on source IP addresses. Because of the limited number of available filters in the routers today, aggregation is used in practice: a single filter describes and blocks an entire range of IP addresses. This results in blocking of all (unwanted and wanted) traffic generated from hosts with IP addresses in that range. In this paper, we develop a family of algorithms that, given a blacklist containing the source IP addresses of unwanted traffic and a constraint on the number of filters, construct a set of filtering rules that optimize the tradeoff between the unwanted and legitimate traffic that is blocked. We show that our algorithms are optimal and also computationally efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that they are particularly beneficial when applied to realistic distributions of sources of unwanted traffic, which are known to exhibit spatial and temporal clustering.","","978-1-4244-2670-6","","10.1109/ITA.2008.4601049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601049","","Clustering algorithms;Computer crime;Constraint optimization;Filtering algorithms;Floods;Information filtering;Information filters;Internet;Jacobian matrices;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;filtering theory;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","Internet;distributed denial-of-service attacks;filtering sources;realistic distributions;routers based on source IP addresses;temporal clustering;unwanted traffic","","3","","11","","","Jan. 27 2008-Feb. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multimatch classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAMs are expensive and consume large amounts of power. None of the previously published multimatch classification schemes are both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new set splitting algorithm (SSA). The main idea behind SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least 1/2 the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low-power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: multimatch using discriminators (MUD) (Lakshminarayanan and Rangarajan, 2005) and geometric intersection-based solutions (Yu and Katz, 2004). Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75%-95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with geometric intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet. We also show that SSA can be combined with SRAM/TCAM hybrid approaches to further reduce energy consumption","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2006.877134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705613","Energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification;ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)","Associative memory;Costs;Counting circuits;Energy consumption;Intrusion detection;Matched filters;Multiuser detection;Payloads;Random access memory;US Department of Commerce","content-addressable storage;pattern classification;telecommunication security","SNORT filter set;SSA;TCAM lookup;multimatch packet classification;network security application;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memory","","11","","32","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The ANN is trained on the recorded data - voltage, current and ambient temperature, to produce a non-linear model and to accurately predict the state of charge (SOC) of the battery. The SOC prediction is based on the recent behavior of the battery. Preliminary experimental results using recorded datasets from the battery design studio are presented for the lithium ion battery.
