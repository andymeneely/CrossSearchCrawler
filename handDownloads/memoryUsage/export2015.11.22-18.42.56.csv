"Intrusion detection system- An efficient way to thwart against Dos/DDos attack in the cloud environment","Aishwarya, R.; Malliga, S.","Dept. of CSE, Kongu Eng. Coll., Erode, India","Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT), 2014 International Conference on","20141229","2014","","","1","6","One of the emerging and glooming technologies in the IT is Cloud computing where the information is permanently stored in the third party cloud servers and cached temporarily on clients that include different devices like desktops, entertainment centers, table computers, notebooks, wall computers, sensors, etc. Internet connection is the basic requirement for accessing the cloud. Virtualization technology is another technology which goes along with the cloud environment which is used most widely to reduce the cost purchasing the hardware infrastructures in organizations. Henceforth, the Cloud Computing Systems can be easily intruded by various types of cyber attacks including Denial of Serv-ice (DoS) attack and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack which utilize the entire resources like CPU, Memory, etc and makes the server to starve. This creates a major impact reducing the efficiency of the virtual machines. In the proposed method, attack can be overcome by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Mitigation Strategy which uses the SYN Cookie to prevent the attack in the cloud to prevent the attack in which the server ignores the connection packets when it does not receive the correct Acknowledgement (ACK) from the client which requested the connection. The server here has rules to be check whether it is a legitimate client or the spoofed one using the first layer of security for hop count filtering mechanism and second layer of security is encoding the sequence number of the SYN packet so that only a legitimate client can decode it. Additionally security is also provided for the data packets using the Message Authentication Code (MAC) and thus client is authenticated.","","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2014.6996163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996163","DoS/DDoS;Hop-Count Filtering;Message Authentication Code;SYN Cookie;Sequence number;Virtualization","Cloud computing;Computer crime;Filtering;IP networks;Servers","cloud computing;computer network security;message authentication;transport protocols","ACK;CPU resource;DDos attack;Internet connection;MAC;SYN cookie;SYN packet;TCP mitigation strategy;Transmission Control Protocol mitigation strategy;acknowledgement;authenticated client;cloud access;cloud computing systems;connection packets;cyber attacks;data packets;distributed denial-of-service attack prevention;hardware infrastructures;hop count filtering mechanism;intrusion detection system;legitimate client;memory resource;message authentication code;purchasing cost reduction;security layer;sequence number encoding;spoofed client;temporarily cached information storage;third-party cloud servers;virtual machines;virtualization technology","","0","","14","","","10-12 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Agent-Based Self-Adaptable Context-Aware Network Vulnerability Assessment","Jiang, F.; Daoyi Dong; Longbing Cao; Frater, M.R.","Sch. of Eng. & IT, Univ. of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, NSW, Australia","Network and Service Management, IEEE Transactions on","20130913","2013","10","3","255","270","Immunology inspired computer security has attracted enormous attention as its potential impacts on the next generation service-oriented network operation system. In this paper, we propose a new agent-based threat awareness assessment strategy inspired by the human immune system to dynamically adapt against attacks. Specifically, this approach is based on the dynamic reconfiguration of the file access right for system calls or logs (e.g., file rewritability) with balanced adaptability and vulnerability. Based on an information-theoretic analysis on the coherently associations of adaptability, autonomy as well as vulnerability, a generic solution is suggested to break down their coherent links. The principle is to maximize context-situation awared systems' adaptability and reduce systems' vulnerability simultaneously. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed biological behaviour-inspired vulnerability awareness system.","1932-4537","","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.090313.120388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599023","Vulnerability assessment;agent-based system;intrusion detection system (IDS);management information base (MIB);threats awareness analysis","Computer security;Intrusion detection;Management information systems;Measurement uncertainty;Multi-agent systems;Next generation networking;Service-oriented architecture","file organisation;multi-agent systems;security of data;service-oriented architecture;ubiquitous computing","agent based self-adaptable context aware network vulnerability assessment;computer security;dynamic reconfiguration;file access;file rewritability;human immune system;information theoretic analysis;next generation service oriented network operation system","","0","","35","","","September 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"DTAD: A Dynamic Taint Analysis Detector for Information Security","Bai, Zhiwen; Liming Wang; Jinglin Chen; Lin Xu; Jian Liu; Xiyang Liu","Software Eng. Inst., Xidian Univ., Xi''an","Web-Age Information Management, 2008. WAIM '08. The Ninth International Conference on","20080812","2008","","","591","597","Information infection and information leakage in computer systems are mainly caused by insecure network access. Considering the particularity of network security, a tool DTAD (dynamic taint analysis detector) for information flow security detection is designed and implemented, aiming at the problem of data security in network access. This tool performs log recording and state controlling for malicious access and virus vulnerability using the state-control characteristic of virtual machines. Defense systems capture network data by executing applications to determine whether these accesses (i.e. target jumping, function address and instruction access) are legitimate or not. Once an attack is detected, the tool records states of the virtual machine at the process level as well as the kernel level. For attacks caused by malicious code, the tool injects its own diagnostic code into the process space of running programs to substitute the malicious code, as a result, related information for the attacked process is collected. The tool is able to generate precise signatures for network intrusion detection by associating and comparing network data recorded in log files with process information collected by the virtual machine, the whole process is finished automatically. The tool can also precisely identify attack types and provide effective protection measures through fast signature releasing. Experiments have validated the efficiency of the tool in attack recognition and information protection, and indicated that this detection and protection system is effective in recognizing, tracking and processing taint data.","","978-0-7695-3185-4","978-0-7695-3185-4","10.1109/WAIM.2008.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597071","","Costs;Data security;Detectors;Information analysis;Information management;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protection;Virtual machining;Viruses (medical)","computer viruses;program diagnostics;virtual machines","attack recognition;computer systems;data security;defense systems;diagnostic code;dynamic taint analysis detector;information flow security detection;information infection;information leakage;information protection;information security;log recording;malicious access;network access;network intrusion detection;state control;virtual machines;virus vulnerability","","0","","28","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previously, many hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate regular expression matching using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) because FPGAs allow updating of new attack patterns. Because of the increasing number of attacks, we need to accommodate a large number of regular expressions on FPGAs. Although the minimization of logic equations has been studied intensively in the area of computer-aided design (CAD), the minimization of multiple regular expressions has been largely neglected. This paper presents a novel sharing architecture allowing our algorithm to extract and share common subregular expressions. Experimental results show that our sharing scheme significantly reduces the area of pattern matching circuits for regular expression.","1063-8210","","","10.1109/TVLSI.2007.909801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378271","Finite automata;field-programmable gate array (FPGA);intrusion detection;pattern matching","Acceleration;Circuits;Design automation;Equations;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic design;Minimization;Pattern matching","field programmable gate arrays;logic design;minimisation;security of data","FPGA;attack patterns;computer-aided design;logic equations;minimization;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching circuits;regular expression matching;sharing architecture;subregular expressions","","22","14","19","","","Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
