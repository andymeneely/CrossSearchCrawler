In the literature, several solutions have been developed to secure SCADA systems; however; the literature is lacking work directed at the development of tools to evaluate the effectiveness of such solutions. An essential requirement of such tools is the generation of normal and malicious SCADA traffic. In this paper, we present an automated tool to generate a malicious SCADA traffic to be used to evaluate such systems. We consider the traffic generation of the popular SCADA Modbus protocol. The characteristics of the generated traffic are derived from Snort network intrusion detection system (NIDS) Modbus rules. The tool uses Scapy to generate packets based on the extracted traffic features. We present the testing results for our tool. The tool is used to read a Snort rule file that contains Modbus rules to extract the required traffic features.","","","","10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923938","Modbus;Network security;SCADA System;Scapy;Snort","Feature extraction;IP networks;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Receivers;SCADA systems","SCADA systems;computer network security;protocols","Modbus traffic generator;NIDS Modbus rules;SCADA Modbus protocol;SCADA systems security evaluation;Scapy;Snort network intrusion detection system;malicious SCADA traffic;supervisory control and data acquisition system","","0","","18","","","23-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, TCP/IP based networks have no protection against malicious packet modifications and attackers do exploit such vulnerabilities to attack others as well as forging IP packets to hide source IP address of attack packets, hence attackers could hinder the efforts to identify the real origin of attacks using Firewall, Intrusion Detection System and other traffic capturing tools. Therefore, having ability to trace back to the origin of the attack becomes an important part of incident investigation. There are number of trace back schemes available but their effective tracking range is up to the very first edge routers or even worse, data used by such methods could be forged and/or tricked, hence use of existing methods are limited for crimes investigation. Network Forensic Evidence Acquisition (NFEA) scheme proposed in this paper is a new trace back scheme that offers improved effective tracking range with consideration for providing admissible evidence. NFEA guarantees authenticity and integrity of tracking data collected based on Authenticated Evidence Marking Scheme (AEMS). AEMS also improves effective tracking range by producing tracking data at edge-routers, which also helps to minimize loss in overall network performance. Effect on edge-routers' performance is also guaranteed using Flow-based Selection Marking Scheme (FSMS). An implementation of NFEA has been evaluated and the result shows that NFEA is viable to deploy in real networks.","","978-1-4577-0524-3","978-0-7695-4429-8","10.1109/ISPAW.2011.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952007","DDoS attacks;IP traceback;network forensic;network security;packet marking","Computer crime;Cryptography;Decoding;Encoding;Forensics;IP networks;Radio frequency","Internet;computer forensics;computer network security","AEMS;DDoS attack;Internet crimes;NFEA;TCP/IP based networks;authenticated evidence marking scheme;firewall;flow-based selection marking scheme;intrusion detection system;malicious packet modifications;network forensic evidence acquisition;packet marking","","0","","30","","","26-28 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But during the past year or so, we have observed an unprecedented growth in classic file-infecting viruses that have enjoyed a relatively high degree of success in the wild - causing widespread damage to computer systems. Many of the new viruses seen today aren't advancements in their own right; rather, they have just taken advantage of advancements in technology. And the sophistication of infection techniques and vectors used by viruses these days are on the rise. With a recent increase in network file-infecting viruses, it's high time we revisit the traditional techniques used to detect virus-like activity on the network and improve them. This paper proposes using virtual area networks (VLANs) technology to mass deploy a SAMBA based honeypot to the entire site. We also look at setting up a server message block (SMB) based sniffer to capture file-infector activity on the local area network.

Examples of these situations include tracking down the host from which an attack was launched. In this work we propose a new architecture for IPPT (IP Packet Tracing) based on the traditional concept of keeping traffic logs stored in Bloom filters. The proposed architecture returns an attack graph that precisely identifies the route traversed by a given packet allowing the correct identification of the attacker. We show that previously published approaches may return misleading attack graphs in some particular situations, which may even avoid the determination of the real attacker. The proposed architecture has two other features that improve the efficiency of the returned attack graph: separate logs are kept for each router interface improving the distributed search procedure; an efficient dynamic log paging strategy is proposed. The communication among the system's components preserves the confidentiality of the packet's information.

A typical SGI may consist of disparate and heterogeneous devices, cooperating and exchanging customer-specific data (readings), in hierarchical manner (from consumer devices to centralized servers through smart meters and data concentrators/aggregators). The interconnection of all such devices (both through wireless and wired channels) to the Internet, exposes the SGI to threats that do indeed exist, and have transpired into malicious attacks against critical information resources during the past two decades. One attack category that may be identified for the SGI is the device implant attack, wherein rogue devices may be installed within a consumer's premises so as to report falsified readings to the smart meter.

In this paper, we compare the ability of Snort-Wireless and a genetic programming (GP) based intrusion detector, in the detection of a particular data link layer attack, namely the deauthentication attack. We focus particularly on a scenario where the attacker stealthily injects the attack frames into the target network. Results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against the different versions of the attack compared to Snort-Wireless and can achieve a detection rate in average 100% and a false positive rate in average 0.1%","","1-4244-0700-1","","10.1109/CISDA.2007.368156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4219103","","Computational intelligence;Data security;Detectors;Genetic programming;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Robustness;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless networks","digital signatures;genetic algorithms;security of data;wireless LAN","GP-based IDS;WiFi networks;data link layer attacks;deauthentication attack;genetic programming;intrusion detection systems;intrusion detector;snort-wireless","","0","","16","","","1-5 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a system would allow the operator to easily extend the system when new detection algorithms become available. It would also allow the operator to maintain a low-cost monitoring baseline and perform more extensive monitoring when it is required. In this paper we propose an architecture for intrusion detection which aims at providing the operator with this support. The architecture uses a modular design to promote a high degree of flexibility. This supports creation of an environment in which state-of-the-art intrusion detection algorithms easily can be inserted. The modular design also allows for detection algorithms to be enabled and disabled when required. Additionally, the architecture uses a sensor reconfiguration mechanism to affect the amount of data collected. When a detection algorithm is enabled or disabled, the sensor providing the input data to the algorithm is correspondingly reconfigured. This implies a minimum of excess collected data. To illustrate the feasibility of the architecture, we provide a proof - of-concept supporting monitoring of users for insider detection and webserver monitoring for intrusion attempts.","","978-0-7695-3324-7","","10.1109/IAS.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627079","adaption;intrusion detection;operator-centric;sensor reconfiguration;system architecture","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication system security;Computer science;Computer security;Detection algorithms;Information security;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Quality of service;Sensor systems","security of data","adaptive intrusion detection;insider detection;low-cost monitoring baseline;modular design;operator-centric intrusion detection;sensor reconfiguration mechanism;webserver monitoring","","0","","22","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve this problem and to accord with the trend of moving more processing power into storage, this paper presents a novel idea to design an IDS on object-based storage devices (OSD), and analyzes how the features of OSD can be used for intrusion detection (ID) and for violation responding. Moreover, the existing OSD standard is enhanced to own the new functions. Compared with the existing research on block-level storage devices, OSD-based ID is more straightforward for implementation.

Recently, a new self-learning strategy for selecting target addresses during malware propagation was introduced in [1], which we refer to as importance scanning. Under the importance-scanning approach, malware employs an address sampling scheme to search for the underlying group distribution of (vulnerable) hosts in the address space through which it propagates. The malware utilizes this information to increase the rate at which it locates viable addresses during its search for infection targets. In this paper, we introduce a strategy to combat importance scanning propagation.We propose the use of white hole networks, which combine several existing components to dissuade, slow, and ultimately halt the propagation of importance scanning malware. Based on analytical reasoning and simulations using real trace and address distribution information, we demonstrate how the white hole approach can provide an effective defense, even when the deployment of this countermeasure represents a very small fraction of the address space population.","","978-1-4244-0974-7","978-1-4244-0975-4","10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550340","","Aggregates;Analytical models;Computer networks;Computer worms;Humans;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Routing;Sampling methods","","","","2","","38","","","17-21 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since incomplete training data is always employed in practice, and environments being monitored are susceptible to changes, a system for anomaly detection should update its HMM parameters in response to new training data from the environment. Several techniques have been proposed in literature for on-line learning of HMM parameters. However, the theoretical convergence of these algorithms is based on an infinite stream of data for optimal performances. When learning sequences with a finite length, on-line incremental versions of these algorithms can improve discrimination by allowing for convergence over several training iterations. In this paper, the performance of these techniques is compared for learning new sequences of training data in host-based intrusion detection. The discrimination of HMMs trained with different techniques is assessed from data corresponding to sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. In addition, the resource requirements are assessed through an analysis of time and memory complexity. Results suggest that the techniques for online incremental learning of HMM parameters can provide a higher level of discrimination than those for on-line learning, yet require significantly fewer resources than with batch training. On-line incremental learning techniques may provide a promising solution for adaptive intrusion detection systems.","","978-1-4244-3763-4","978-1-4244-3764-1","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356542","","Computerized monitoring;Convergence;Detectors;Event detection;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Operating systems;Training data","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection;hidden Markov models;intrusion detection system;memory complexity;online incremental HMM learning;operating system kernel;time complexity","","0","","20","","","8-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A significant number of malicious attacks against the security of such networks have been identified in recent times. Considering the untrusted environments of operations of such networks, the threat of distributed attacks against constrained sensory resources i.e. sensor power, computation and communication capabilities cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based approach towards achieving demarkation in the values of specific parameters of an attack detection scheme for detecting distributed node-exhaustion attacks in wireless sensor networks. Using the Unified And-Or (UAO) aggregation operator, we model and formulate a mechanism to achieve a tradeoff between frequent attack detection and sensor node energy utilization.

Proceedings 17th Annual","20020807","2001","","","252","261","We introduce a new method for detecting intrusions based on the temporal behavior of applications. It builds on an existing method of application intrusion detection developed at the University of New Mexico that uses a system call sequence as a signature. Intrusions are detected by comparing the signature of the intrusion and that of the normal application. But when the system call sequences generated by the intrusion and the normal application are sufficiently similar, this method cannot work. By extending system call signature to incorporate temporal information related to the application, we form a richer signature. Analysis shows that the temporal behavior for many applications is relatively stable. We exclude high variance data when creating a normal database to characterize an application with a temporal signature. It can then be the basis for future comparisons in an intrusion detection system. This paper discusses experiments that test the effectiveness of the temporal signature on different applications, alternative intrusions, and in various environments. The results show that by choosing appropriate analysis methods and experimentally adjusting the parameters, intrusions are readily detected. Finally, we give some comparisons between the temporal signature method and the system call method.","","0-7695-1405-7","","10.1109/ACSAC.2001.991541","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991541","","Application software;Buffer overflow;Computer crime;Databases;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Operating systems;Security;Testing;Time measurement","security of data;system monitoring;temporal logic","applications;call sequence as signature;intrusion detection;system call method;temporal behavior;temporal information;temporal signatures","","6","","17","","","10-14 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first show that memory requirements using traditional methods are prohibitively high for many patterns used in packet scanning applications. We then propose regular expression rewrite techniques that can effectively reduce memory usage. Further, we develop a grouping scheme that can strategically compile a set of regular expressions into several engines, resulting in remarkable improvement of regular expression matching speed without much increase in memory usage. We implement a new DFA-based packet scanner using the above techniques. Our experimental results using real-world traffic and patterns show that our implementation achieves a factor of 12 to 42 performance improvement over a commonly used DFA- based scanner.

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-6442-5","","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374","DFA;Deep packet inspection;FPGA;pipeline;string matching","Automata;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pipelines;Programmable logic arrays;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;ClamAV;Snort;anti-virus systems;field programmable gate array;high performance multipattern string matching;high-speed deep packet inspection;linear pipeline;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input;network intrusion detection;pipelined processing;scalable multipipeline architecture;scalable pipeline architecture","","2","","21","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new method not only overcomes limitations that traditional attribute-value case representation can not represent complex cases, but also combines domain knowledge and case representation through constraint rules. In the aspect of case similarity, we divide it into two categories: the intra- class similarity and the inter-class similarity, which shows more accurate and convenient.

Accordingly, these WSNs should be resilient to attacks. The current approach to defending against malicious threats is to develop and deploy a specific defense mechanism for a specific attack. However, the problem with this traditional approach to defending sensor networks is that the solution for the Jamming attack does not defend against other attacks (e.g., Sybil and Selective Forwarding). In reality, one cannot know a priori what type of attack an adversary will launch. This work addresses the challenges with the traditional approach to securing sensor networks and presents a comprehensive framework, Di-Sec, that can defend against all known and forthcoming attacks. At the heart of Di-Sec lies the monitoring core (M-Core), which is an extensible and lightweight layer that gathers statistics relevant for the defense mechanisms. The M-Core allows for the monitoring of both internal and external threats and supports the execution of multiple detection and defense mechanisms (DDMs) against different threats in parallel. Along with Di-Sec, a new user-friendly domain-specific language was developed, the M-Core Control Language (MCL). Using the MCL, a user can implement new defense mechanisms without the overhead of learning the details of the underlying software architecture (i.e., TinyOS, Di-Sec). Hence, the MCL expedites the development of sensor defense mechanisms by significantly simplifying the coding process for developers. The Di-Sec framework has been implemented and tested on real sensors to evaluate its feasibility and performance. Our evaluation of memory, communication, and sensing components shows that Di-Sec is feasible on today's resource-limited sensors and has a nominal overhead. Furthermore, we illustrate the basic functionality of Di-Sec by implementing and simultaneously executing DDMs for attacks at v- rious layers of the communication stack (i.e., Jamming, Selective Forwarding, Sybil, and Internal attacks).","0743-166X","978-1-4673-0773-4","","10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195801","Distributed Security Framework;M-Core Control Language (MCL);Wireless Sensor Network Security","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Jamming;Monitoring;Security;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;jamming;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Di-Sec;M-Core control language;Sybil;TinyOS;coding process;communication;critical infrastructure;distributed security framework;health care;internal attacks;jamming attack;memory;military;monitoring core;multiple detection;selective forwarding;sensing components;sensor defense mechanisms;software architecture;wireless sensor networks","","6","","17","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, several techniques have been proposed to generate test cases by automatically deriving variations (or mutations) of attacks. Even though these techniques have been useful in identifying ""blindspots"" in the signatures of closed-source, network-based intrusion detection systems, the generation of test cases is performed in a random, un- guided fashion. The reason is that there is no information available about the signatures to be tested. As a result, identifying a test case that is able to evade detection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to drive the generation of test cases by using the information gathered by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the intrusion detection system. Our approach applies dynamic dataflow analysis techniques to the intrusion detection system to identify which parts of a network stream are used to detect an attack and how these parts are matched by a signature. The result of our analysis is a set of constraints that is used to guide the black-box testing process, so that the mutations are applied to only those parts of the attack that are relevant for detection. By doing this, we are able to perform a more focused generation of the test cases and improve the process of identifying an attack variation that evades detection.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412976","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer security;Data analysis;Event detection;Genetic mutations;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Performance evaluation;System testing","data flow analysis;digital signatures;security of data","attack detection;attack variation;black-box testing;dynamic data flow analysis;network stream;network-based intrusion detection;signature testing","","1","","30","","","10-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Securing NDP becomes an important research area as the Internet is deployed widely in public areas, such as airports, where the trust is not necessary between hosts, which may expose them to attacks. In addition, securing network from inside is necessary, particularly when security hierarchical exist between users. One of the major problems in conducting research on IPv6 security is the absence of a reliable dataset, which is essential in testing and evaluating the proposed solutions. This research develops a reliable dataset of IPv6 NDP by capturing the normal and abnormal behaviors of NDP using specific dependable tools. Reliable dataset helps to understand and distinguish between normal behavior and anomalies in IPv6 NDP.","","","","10.1109/ICITCS.2015.7293014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293014","","IP networks;Internet;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Protocols;Reliability","IP networks;computer network security;transport protocols;trusted computing","IPv6 NDP;IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol;IPv6 security;Internet;attacks;local area network;network security;reliable behavioral dataset;reliable dataset;security issues;trust","","","","","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the context of IGP routing, when a failure occurs, a re-convergence process is initiated in order to re-establish a consistent view of the network. During this process, the latency of the failure detection, which is realized by the Hello protocol, is responsible for an important unavailability. Indeed, quick failure detection would require the use of fast Hello exchange which, in turn, would cause false detection and instability. However, there are often forewarning signs that a network device is about to stop working properly. Based on an embedded and real-time risk-level assessment, one can adapt in a real-time manner the Hello message frequency of sick nodes and thus reduce unavailability while maintaining the routing stability. This papers details and evaluates a mechanism for adaptive failure detection timers in IGP networks. The impacts in terms of availability and quantity of Hello messages have been estimated based on an analytical model and then simulated to measure the benefits of the proposed proactive self-healing function.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663519","","Availability;Convergence;IP networks;Network topology;Routing;Routing protocols","IP networks;stability;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network routing","Hello message frequency;Hello protocol;IGP networks;adaptive failure detection timers;analytical model;carrier networks;communication services;false detection;fast Hello exchange;instability;proactive self- healing function;re-convergence process;real-time risk-level assessment;routing stability","","0","","20","","","22-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To accommodate this increase in application and data complexity, web services have moved to a multitiered design wherein the webserver runs the application front-end logic and data are outsourced to a database or file server. In this paper, we present DoubleGuard, an IDS system that models the network behavior of user sessions across both the front-end webserver and the back-end database. By monitoring both web and subsequent database requests, we are able to ferret out attacks that an independent IDS would not be able to identify. Furthermore, we quantify the limitations of any multitier IDS in terms of training sessions and functionality coverage. We implemented DoubleGuard using an Apache webserver with MySQL and lightweight virtualization. We then collected and processed real-world traffic over a 15-day period of system deployment in both dynamic and static web applications. Finally, using DoubleGuard, we were able to expose a wide range of attacks with 100 percent accuracy while maintaining 0 percent false positives for static web services and 0.6 percent false positives for dynamic web services.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2011.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6081881","Anomaly detection;multitier web application.;virtualization","Containers;Databases;Service oriented architecture;Training;Web servers","SQL;Web services;database management systems;security of data;virtualisation","Apache Web server;DoubleGuard;IDS system;Internet services;MySQL;Web services;application front-end logic;back-end database;data complexity;database requests;front-end Web server;intrusion detection;multitier Web applications;multitiered design;network behavior;personal information management","","4","","52","","2011-11-15","July-Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Internet services, and the number of Internet users increases every day this makes networks as a window for malicious users to do their damage becomes very great and lucrative. The objective of this paper is to incorporate different methods to detect and classify intrusion from normal network packet. Among several evolutionary techniques, Steady State Genetic-based Machine Leaning Algorithm (SSGBML) will be used to detect intrusions with Zeroth Level Classifier system (ZCS) are investigated here. Steady State Genetic Algorithm (SSGA) is used as a discovery mechanism instead of Simple Genetic Algorithm ( SGA). SGA replaces all old rules with new produced rule preventing old good rules from participating in the next rule generation. In contrast, SSGA gives a chance for previous rules to participate in new generations. ZCS is used to play the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether the current message is normal or intrusion and receiving feedback from environment. The experiments and evaluations of the proposed method were performed with the KDD 99 intrusion detection dataset.","","978-1-4244-8844-5","978-1-4244-8845-2","10.1109/ICCTD.2010.5645857","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645857","Network Intrusion Detection;SGA;SSGA;SSGBML;ZCS;component","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;Detectors;Fires;Monitoring;Probes","Internet;computer network security;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Internet service;KDD 99 intrusion detection dataset;Zeroth level classifier system;computer network;discovery mechanism;event monitoring;evolutionary method;network intrusion detection;steady state genetic-based machine leaning algorithm","","0","","24","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Having this information would speed the search for zero-day exploits and designate precisely which system components could have been affected by an intrusion. Unfortunately, it may be several months after the infection before any latent effect is observed and there is no way to attest which, if any, of the affected processes are related to the original exploit. In addition, the system under observation cannot be trusted to record the necessary forensic information as the infection may deliberately hide its presence. These problems subsequently hamper system recovery and data verification efforts. This paper describes a novel forensic hypervisor design that provides coarse-grained process tracking and utilizes next generation Intel virtualization technology, leveraging extended page tables and enforcing MULTICS style protection techniques. Custom forensic introspection techniques are used to walk the extended page tables to inspect a virtual machines state and track the associated processes. A description of the steps necessary to perform tracking are presented; the real-time performance impact is quantified at less than 11μs for each system call.","2155-7578","978-1-4673-1729-0","","10.1109/MILCOM.2012.6415817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415817","Forensics;Introspection;Operating Systems;Virtualization","Forensics;Hardware;Kernel;Program processors;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Virtualization","digital forensics;formal verification;operating systems (computers);virtual machines;virtualisation","MULTICS style protection technique;computing environment;custom forensic introspection;data verification;exploit discovery;forensic hypervisor design;forensic information;interaction history;intrusion;memory;next generation Intel virtualization technology;operating system;page table;process tracking;real-time forensic reconstruction;server;system component;system recovery;virtual machine","","1","","22","","","Oct. 29 2012-Nov. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once confined to the network, they are now conducted over the hypercall interface. These attacks are initiated by malicious, unprivileged guests with a goal of incapacitating hosting hypervisors. Because they are not packet-based, they cannot be detected or prevented using network security measures. The present study systematically explores this risk and develops a taxonomy of hypercall-based DoS attacks. For purpose of illustration, a denial of service is attempted against a Xen hypervisor. This scenario demonstrates that even a relatively simple attack could have significant implications for system stability. Finally, system for defending hypervisors against hypercall attacks is introduced. This mitigation observes N-grams and calculates the conditional probability of a sequence of hypercalls. The assumption is that exploits will be manifested as previously-unobserved sequences of hypercalls.

One of the most promising ways to provide security is Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). The heart of almost every IDSs is a string matching algorithm, which is a very computational intensive task. Network Processors (NPs), a specialized multiprocessor, can provide flexibility and high performance for string matching. This paper evaluates several key string matching algorithms using a comprehensive simulation framework. Starting from a uniprocessor profiling, the framework constructs task graphs for string matching algorithms. Then task graphs are mapped onto NPs together with other network applications. The system throughput is determined by the analytical performance model. With this framework, we can evaluate the performance of different string matching algorithms on NPs. Our results show that shift table based algorithms (SFKSearch and Wu-Manber) and finite automaton based Aho-Corasick are complementary: SFKSearch and Wu-Manber do better job in NPs for good packet and larger pattern length due to better inter-task parallelism and shifting; Aho-Corasick does not depend on minimal pattern length and shows relative small processing cost variation between bad and good packets.","","978-1-4244-1967-8","978-1-4244-1968-5","10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4493512","","Analytical models;Automata;Computational modeling;Costs;Heart;Internet;Intrusion detection;Parallel processing;Performance analysis;Throughput","security of data;string matching","Internet;analytical performance model;intrusion detection systems;network processors;string matching algorithms","","1","","21","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent malware are not only becoming more sophisticated, but have also demonstrated a trend to make use of components, which can easily be distributed through the Internet to develop newer and better malware. As a result, the key problem facing Cloud security is to cope with identifying diverse sets of malware. This paper presents a method of detecting malware by identifying the symptoms of malicious behaviour as opposed to looking for the malware itself. This can be compared to the use of symptoms in human pathology, in which study of symptoms direct physicians to diagnosis of a disease or possible causes of illnesses. The main advantage of shifting the attention to the symptoms is that a wide range of malicious behaviour can result in the same set of symptoms. We propose the creation of Forensic Virtual Machines (FVM), which are mini Virtual Machines (VM) that can monitor other VMs to discover the symptoms. In this paper, we shall present a framework to support the FVMs so that they collaborate with each other in identifying symptoms by exchanging messages via secure channels. The FVMs report to a Command & Control module that collects and correlates the information so that suitable remedial actions can take place in real-time. The Command & Control can be compared to the physician who infers possibility of an illness from the occurring symptoms. In addition, as FVMs make use of the computational resources of the system we will present an algorithm for sharing of the FVMs so that they can be guided to search for the symptoms in the VMs with higher priority.","1541-7719","978-1-4673-2444-1","","10.1109/EDOC.2012.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337247","Cloud;security;virtualisation","Algorithm design and analysis;Linux;Malware;Monitoring;Software;Virtual machining","cloud computing;invasive software;virtual machines","FVM;Internet;VM;cloud computing;cloud security;command & control module;forensic virtual machines;human pathology;identifying symptoms;malicious behaviour;malware detection;virtual machines","","5","","19","","","10-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper analyzes existing VMM-based models of malware detection. ""Out-of-the-box"" detection, active defense model, or In-VM models have the same defects: (1) on top of the VMM, two virtual machines are used, one by the user (Guest OS) and the other as monitor (Host OS), and (2) users cannot directly view the detection results nor configure detection system in the Guest OS. A layered detection model is proposed to overcome these issues, the bottom layer is responsible for security for the layers above it. Detection results can be directly displayed in the Guest OS, and users can view and configure the detection system. Furthermore, the detection model can isolate malware attacks to the detection system in the Guest OS.

In dynamic and decentralized settings where the traffic, topology and channel states may vary over time and the communication between agents is impractical, it is important to formulate and study games of incomplete information and fully distributed learning algorithms which for each agent requires a minimal amount of information regarding the remaining agents. In this paper, we address this major challenge and introduce heterogeneous learning schemes in which each agent adopts a distinct learning pattern in the context of games with incomplete information. We use stochastic approximation techniques to show that the heterogeneous learning schemes can be studied in terms of their deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) counterparts. Depending on the learning rates of the players, these ODEs could be different from the standard replicator dynamics, (myopic) best response (BR) dynamics, logit dynamics, and fictitious play dynamics. We apply the results to a class of security games in which the attacker and the defender adopt different learning schemes due to differences in their rationality levels and the information they acquire.","0743-1546","978-1-4244-7745-6","","10.1109/CDC.2010.5718053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718053","","Approximation algorithms;Equations;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Stochastic processes;Trajectory","approximation theory;differential equations;learning (artificial intelligence);stochastic games","agent communication;best response dynamics;deterministic ordinary differential equation;fictitious play dynamics;game theory;heterogeneous learning algorithm;incomplete information context;logit dynamics;security games;standard replicator dynamics;stochastic approximation techniques;zero-sum stochastic games","","7","","12","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a cyber-attack detection technique through anomaly-detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique, a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer-event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov-chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain model of the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lower probability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chain model of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activities are anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. This paper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly-detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solaris operating system. The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber-attack detection is presented through discussions & applications. To apply the Markov-chain technique and other stochastic process techniques to model the sequential ordering of events, the quality of activity-data plays an important role in the performance of intrusion detection. The Markov-chain technique is not robust to noise in the data (the mixture level of normal activities and intrusive activities). The Markov-chain technique produces desirable performance only at a low noise level. This study also shows that the performance of the Markov-chain techniques is not always robust to the window size: as the window size increases, the amount of noise in the window also generally increases. Overall, this study provides some support for the idea that the Markov-chain technique might not be as robust as the other intrusion-detection methods such as the chi-square distance test technique , although it can produce better performance than the chi-square distance test techn- ique when the noise level of the data is low, such as the Mill & Pascal data in this study.","0018-9529","","","10.1109/TR.2004.823851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282169","","Computer networks;Computer security;Inference algorithms;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Noise level;Noise robustness;Operating systems;Stochastic processes;Testing","Markov processes;computer networks;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;telecommunication security","Markov-chain model;Solaris operating system;activity-data quality;anomaly-detection technique;chi-square distance test technique;computer audit data;computer security;computer-event transitions;cyber-attack detection;inference algorithms;intrusion detection;learning algorithms;noise level;stochastic process;window size","","38","1","56","","","March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Proceedings. 12th Annual IEEE Symposium on","20050103","2004","","","28","34","Today's packet classification systems are designed to provide the highest priority matching result, e.g., the longest prefix match, even if a packet matches multiple classification rules. However, new network applications, such as intrusion detection systems, require information about all the matching results. We call this the multi-match classification problem. In several complex network applications, multi-match classification is immediately followed by other processing dependent on the classification results. Therefore, classification should be even faster than the line rate. Pure software solutions cannot be used due to their slow speeds. We present a solution based on ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), which produces multi-match classification results with only one TCAM lookup and one SRAM lookup per packet - about ten times fewer memory lookups than a pure software approach. In addition, we present a scheme to remove the negation format in rule sets, which can save up to 95% of TCAM space compared with the straight forward solution. We show that using our pre-processing scheme, header processing for the SNORT rule set can be done with one TCAM and one SRAM lookup using a 135 KB TCAM.","","0-7803-8686-8","","10.1109/CONECT.2004.1375197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375197","","Application software;Associative memory;CADCAM;Complex networks;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer crime;Computer worms;Delay;Intrusion detection;Random access memory","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;table lookup","135 KB;SRAM lookup;header processing;intrusion detection systems;multi-match packet classification;negation format;rule sets;ternary content addressable memory","","21","","14","","","25-27 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And we focus on dropping-packet attacks which are the sore point in wireless sensor networks. We claim that of course our model is not only a detective model but also a correctional model. because first we corner malicious nodes and then we give them incentives to mend their ways and try to behave in favor of other nodes in WSN. We formulate the attack-defense problem as a non-cooperative, two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a WSN. We propose a repeated game model of dropping packets which is attack-proof against DPA based on such an assumption that sensor nodes are rational. The model prevents malicious nodes from attacking by establishing subgame perfect periodic collusion-resistant punishment mechanism, and impels sensor networks to reach a cooperative Nash equilibrium. So, it leads to a defense strategy for the network. And when the malicious nodes populate less than the majority of network we show that our model is partially collusion resistant. And even we try to use the sporadic well-mannered cooperative behavior of the malicious node in favor of improving overall throughput of our WSN. Based on rationality we believe that even malicious nodes before being known as extreme notorious nodes, they try to impersonate their true type and show a little collaborative behavior.","0840-7789","978-1-4244-5376-4","978-1-4244-5377-1","10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575157","Nash equilibrium;Subgame perfect equilibrium;WSN — Intrusion detection system (IDS);attack-resistant mechanism;repeated game","Games;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Mobile ad hoc networks;Nash equilibrium;Wireless sensor networks","game theory;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attack-defense problem;cooperative Nash equilibrium;dropping-packet attacks;game-theoretical model;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor networks","","1","","23","","","2-5 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, our approach uses a computationally low-cost solution to define the area of interest for tracking of multiple, moving objects. Despite its simplicity, it compares very well to existing approaches due to its robustness towards environmental changes. To demonstrate this, we present results of processing a sequence of JPEG-compressed monocular images of a parking lot in order to track pedestrians, cars and bicycles.

Besides pointing out that data-flow-based detectors can be layered on top of control-flow-based ones (or vice versa) to improve accuracy, there is a large gap between the two research directions in that research along one direction had been fairly isolated and had not made good use of results from the other direction. In this paper, we show how data-flow analysis can leverage results from control-flow analysis to learn more accurate and useful rules for anomaly detection. Our results show that the proposed control-flow-analysis-aided data-flow analysis reveals some accurate and useful rules that cannot be learned in prior data-flow analysis techniques. These relations among system call arguments and return values are useful in detecting many real attacks. A trace-driven evaluation shows that the proposed technique enjoys low false-alarm rates and overhead when implemented on a production server.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3447-3","","10.1109/ACSAC.2008.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4721575","anomaly detection;control-flow;data-flow;system call argument","Computer security;Control system analysis;Control systems;Counting circuits;Data analysis;Detectors;Information analysis;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Performance analysis","data flow analysis;security of data","anomaly detection;control-flow analysis;control-flow-based detectors;data propagation;data-flow analysis;data-flow-based detectors;false-alarm rates;intrusion detection;production server;system calls","","3","","21","","","8-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, network researchers develop their own tools, sometimes from scratch, to fit the requirements of their experimentations, and these tools are then abandoned when the paper is published.

In this regard, we propose a survey and classification of IEEE 802.11 wireless parameters and open source tools available to collect or estimate these parameters. We highlight the parameters that can be extracted from wireless traffic probes and those that are available through the driver of wireless cards. Then, we introduce and compare open source tools that can be used to make the measurements, with special attention to the flexibility of the tools and their application scope.

The First International Conference on","20060508","2006","","","8 pp.","","Most current anomaly intrusion detection systems (IDSs) detect computer network behavior as normal or abnormal but cannot identify the type of attacks. Moreover, most current intrusion detection methods cannot process large amounts of audit data for real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for intrusion identification in computer networks based on principal component analysis (PCA). Each network connection is transformed into an input data vector. PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data vectors and identification is handled in a low dimensional space with high efficiency and low use of system resources. The normal behavior is profiled based on normal data for anomaly detection and models of each type of attack are built based on attack data for intrusion identification. The distance between a vector and its reconstruction onto those reduced subspaces representing the different types of attacks and normal activities is used for identification. The method is tested with network data from MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 DARPA intrusion detection evaluation program and testing results show that the model is promising in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time intrusion identification.","","0-7695-2567-9","","10.1109/ARES.2006.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1625320","","Computer networks;Computer security;Data mining;Data security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Testing","computer crime;computer networks;principal component analysis","PCA;anomaly detection;computer network;intrusion detection system;intrusion identification;principal component analysis","","6","","19","","","20-22 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the smartphones are becoming widespread, it's also becoming a popular target for security threats and attack. Since smartphones use the same software architecture as in PCs, they are vulnerable to be exposed to similar threats such as in PCs. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS). Major limitations of smartphone technology are its processing power and its scarce energy source since smartphones rely on battery usage. The smartphones have less storage and computational power to put into effect highly complex algorithms for intrusion detection and implementing signature based attack detection.

The insider attacker detection scheme proposed in this paper meets all the requirements by exploring the spatial correlation existent among the networking behaviors of sensors in close proximity. Our work is exploratory in that the proposed algorithm considers multiple attributes simultaneously in node behavior evaluation, with no requirement on a prior knowledge about normal/malicious sensor activities. Moreover, it is application-friendly, which employs original measurements from sensors and can be employed to monitor many aspects of sensor networking behaviors. Our algorithm is purely localized, fitting well to the large-scale sensor networks. Simulation results indicate that internal adversaries can be identified with a high accuracy and a low false alarm rate when as many as 25% sensors are misbehaving.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215807","","Authentication;Batteries;Collaborative work;Communication system security;Cryptography;Data security;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","attacker detection;cryptography-based techniques;internal adversary identification;large-scale sensor networks;spatial correlation;wireless sensor networks","","41","","30","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed IDS called NIDS-SA, three basic components are developed to support the active monitoring capability, Intrusion Detection Node (IDN), Intrusion Detection Coordinator (IDC), and Snooper Agent (SA). The IDN is used to capture packets, de-multiplex packets, detect local intrusion and infer intrusion. The IDC is installed in an administration workstation for communicating and managing IDNs, it can also do the intrusion detection and intrusion inferring. The RA consists of several snoop functions for information gathering. After an attack behavior is detected, the RA may launch some kinds of information gathering functions to the attacker, so that the proposed NIDS-SA has the active snoop ability. Furthermore, NIDS-SA includes the functions of the pattern matching and statistical inference. To ensure the secure communication ability between IDC and IDNs, the cryptography-based mechanisms are applied in the design phase of the proposed NIDS-SA. An intrusion detection experiment is carried out in our campus to simulate the real attack scenarios and validate the performance of NIDS-SA.","","978-1-4244-7235-2","978-1-4244-7237-6","10.1109/ICCASM.2010.5620022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620022","Multi agent system;Network intrusion detection system;Pattern matching;Statistical analysis","Engines;Fires;IP networks","computer network security;cryptography;data mining;demultiplexing;inference mechanisms;pattern matching;statistical analysis","NIDS-SA;active monitoring capability;active snoop ability;administration workstation;attack behavior detection;cryptography-based mechanism;information gathering;intrusion detection coordinator;intrusion detection node;intrusion inferring;local intrusion detection;network intrusion detection system;packet demultiplexing;pattern matching;protection ability;secure communication;snoop function;snooper agent;snooping agents;statistical inference","","0","","12","","","22-24 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The service at these stages is characterised to be mutually exclusive; that is, only one stage is active at any time.

In this paper we propose an outlier detection algorithm able to exploit the internal parallelism of a GPU and the external parallelism of a cluster of GPU.

This autonomous topology of MANET makes it vulnerable against the internal attacks, such as black hole, wormhole, and flooding, from inside the system. One existing solution to this problem has been achieved by using Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NACK method is easy to implement and has a high level of packet delivery with lightweight security monitoring. However, although packet delivery is guaranteed in NACK, its high rate of routing overhead and high level of energy consumption become as two big weaknesses of the network, especially when it comes to increasing the mobility and the number of insider attacks. In this study the performance of NACK in this regard has been challenged and investigated in different scenarios. Then a new approach, called Selective Negative Acknowledgement (SNACK), based on NACK and Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) is proposed. It is shown that the proposed acknowledgement method outperforms NACK with much less packet overhead, by comparing the results of simulations in Network Simulator v-2.35 (NS-2).","0840-7789","978-1-4799-5827-6","","10.1109/CCECE.2015.7129395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129395","Internal Attacker;Intrusion Detection System;Mobile Ad-Hoc Network;Negative/Selective-Acknowledgement","Cryptography;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Nickel;Protocols;Routing","mobile ad hoc networks;mobility management (mobile radio);security of data;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;Network Simulator v-2.35;SACK;SNACK method;black hole;independent devices;intrusion detection system;lightweight security monitoring;mobile ad-hoc network;packet delivery;selective acknowledgement;selective-negative acknowledgement algorithm;wormhole","","0","","20","","","3-6 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most anomaly based NIDSs employ supervised algorithms, whose performances highly depend on attack-free training data. However, this kind of training data is difficult to obtain in real world network environment. Moreover, with changing network environment or services, patterns of normal traffic will be changed. This leads to high false positive rate of supervised NIDSs. Unsupervised outlier detection can overcome the drawbacks of supervised anomaly detection. Therefore, we apply one of the efficient data mining algorithms called random forests algorithm in anomaly based NIDSs. Without attack-free training data, random forests algorithm can detect outliers in datasets of network traffic. In this paper, we discuss our framework of anomaly based network intrusion detection. In the framework, patterns of network services are built by random forests algorithm over traffic data. Intrusions are detected by determining outliers related to the built patterns. We present the modification on the outlier detection algorithm of random forests. We also report our experimental results over the KDD'99 dataset.

This is why, so far, they are only used in the field of network intrusion detection. In this paper, we present our results concerning a concurrent host memory sampling mechanism based on direct memory access (DMA) and demonstrate that it is possible to de-couple GPU kernel execution, thereby providing temporary isolation from the host and allowing data sampling actions to be taken without interruption.
