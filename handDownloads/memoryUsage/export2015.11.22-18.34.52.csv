To route the number of packets in WSN, the idea is to consider about Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP). The first hybrid routing protocol having proactive and reactive features was ZRP. Reconfigurable Wireless Networks has an ability to reconstruct its networks if network crash takes place and ZRP follow, highly mobile environment and it helps to enhance capabilities of proactive protocol routing protocols and because of increase in the search of route per time for same route or different latency decreases of reactive protocol. It is very important to analyze the scalability characteristics of the routing protocols with respect to these parameters. To protect from the stealthier version of sinkhole attacks in ZRP, sinkhole indicator is used so that performance of network increases.","","978-1-4799-3069-2","","10.1109/CSNT.2014.154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821496","DSR;IARP;IERP;Sinkhole Attack;WSN;ZRP","Ad hoc networks;Artificial neural networks;Mobile computing;Routing;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","hybrid routing protocol;network reconstruction;proactive routing protocol;reactive routing protocol;reconfigurable wireless network;route searching;routing protocol scalability;stealthier attack;wireless sensor network;zone routing protocol","","0","","13","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We discuss how to exploit various compression techniques to conserve the memory usage for better speed tradeoffs on commodity CPUs.

For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Pattern matching is a major task in deep packet inspection. The two most common implementations of Pattern matching are based on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) and Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), which take the payload of a packet as an input string. In this paper, we propose an efficient NFA-based pattern matching in Binary Content Addressable Memory(BCAM), which uses data search words consisting of 1s and 0s. Our approach can process multiple characters at a time using limited BCAM entries, which makes our approach scalable well. We evaluate our algorithm using patterns provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system.

K-nearest neighbor (KNN) is a widely used classification technique and has significant applications in various domains, especially in text classification. The computational-intensive nature of KNN requires a high performance implementation. In this paper, we present a CUDA-based parallel implementation of KNN, CUKNN, using CUDA multi-thread model, where the data elements are processed in a data-parallel fashion. Various CUDA optimization techniques are applied to maximize the utilization of the GPU. CUKNN outperforms the serial KNN on an HP xw8600 workstation significantly, achieving up to 46.71X speedup including I/O time.

We employ an instance of change-point detection, non-parametric Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm, for SYN-flooding detection.

One of the major concerns of the development is its latency delay. Host-based IDS systems inspecting log files provided by operating systems or applications need more time to analyze log content. It demands a large number of computer resources, such as CPU time and memory. Besides, there still a crucial problem about how to transform human behavior into numbers so as measurement can be easily performed. In order to improve the problem addressed we promote IDS called host-based real time intrusion detection system (HRIDS). HRIDS monitors users' activities in a real-time aspect. By defining user profiles, we can easily find out the anomalies and malicious accesses instantly. With the help of user profiles, we cannot only find which account has been misused, but also realize the true intruders. There is no need to update the knowledge databases of HRIDS. It is a self-organized and self-training system. Furthermore, we discover cooperative attacks submitted by users at the same time by using data mining and forensic techniques.","","0-7803-7882-2","","10.1109/CCST.2003.1297623","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1297623","","Application software;Computer displays;Data mining;Delay;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Operating systems;Performance evaluation;Real time systems","computer crime;data mining;real-time systems;safety systems","data mining;forensic techniques;host-based real-time intrusion detection system;intelligent monitor;user profile","","0","","9","","","14-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a typical DDOS attacks a large number of compromised hosts (Zombies) are amassed to send useless packets to jam the victim, or its Internet connection or both. The problem of identifying the attack sources is one of the hardest threats in internet security due to the similarity between the legitimate and illegitimate traffic. Firstly, it is important characteristics of the DDOS attacks that they hide their identities/origins (IP Spoofing). Secondly, the stateless nature of the IP routing where routers normally know only the next hop for the forwarding of packets rather than the complete end to end route taken by each packet make IP traceback difficult. IP traceback (the ability to trace IP packets from source to destination) is a significant step toward identifying and, thus, stopping, attackers. This Review paper evaluates and describes the effectiveness of different existing traceback methods. These methods are based on the enhanced router functions or modifications of the current protocols. Advantages and Disadvantages have also been described in existing techniques to carry out research in this problem.","","978-1-4577-1385-9","","10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075132","Attacks;DDoS;IP Spoofing;IP Traceback;Zombies","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Internet;Probabilistic logic","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;telecommunication network routing","DDOS attacks;IP routing;IP spoofing;IP traceback;Internet connection;Internet security;compromised hosts;distributed denial-of-service;router functions;traceback techniques","","3","","22","","","15-17 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we start by an analysis of connection sojourn time distribution of network traffic. Based on this analysis, first we design a two level session table in order to avoid session table explosion. Then we propose a connection scheduling policy in stateful packet inspection systems called LASF (least attained sojourn first).

However, most existing network-based signatures generated are not vulnerability-based and can be easily evaded by attacks. In this paper, we propose generating vulnerability-based signatures on the network level without any host-level analysis of worm execution or vulnerable programs. As the first step, we design a network-based length-based signature generator (LESG) for worms based on buffer overflow vulnerabilities'. The signatures generated are intrinsic to buffer overflows, and are very hard for attackers to evade. We further prove the attack resilience bounds even under worst case attacks with deliberate noise injection. Moreover, LESG is fast and noise-tolerant and has efficient signature matching. Evaluation based on real-world vulnerabilities of various protocols and real network traffic demonstrates that LESG is promising in achieving these goals.","","978-1-4244-1588-5","978-1-4244-1588-5","10.1109/ICNP.2007.4375847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375847","","Binary codes;Buffer overflow;Character generation;Computer worms;Internet;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Protocols;Resilience;Telecommunication traffic","invasive software;telecommunication security","attack-resilient length signature generation zero-day polymorphic worm detection;buffer overflow;network-based length-based signature generator;vulnerability-based signature","","12","","40","","","16-19 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional software-based solutions can not meet the high bandwidth demanded in current high-speed networks. In the past, the pre-filtering designed for NIDS is an effective technique that can reduce the processing overhead significantly. A FNP- like TCAM searching engine (FTSE) is an example that uses an 2-stage architecture to detect whether an incoming string contains patterns. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of FTSE that utilizes ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) as pre-filter to achieve gigabit performance.

These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e.g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces ""noise"" due to difficulties and imprecision inflow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed to cope with the noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e.g., 80% for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e.g., 50%, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and misleading behavior to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process. This study suggests that unless an accurate and robust flow classification process is in place, automatic syntactic-based signature generators are vulnerable to such noise injection attacks","1081-6011","0-7695-2574-1","","10.1109/SP.2006.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623998","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Manuals;Noise generators;Noise level;Noise robustness;Pollution;Protection","invasive software","Polygraph;automatic syntactic-based signature generators;flow classifier;honeynet;imprecision inflow classification;intrusion detection system;misleading worm signature generators;noise injection attacks;robust flow classification;suspicious flows;syntactic-based automatic worm signature generators","","16","6","28","","","21-24 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This formalism allows us to: (a) characterize the complexity of OSD; (b) use well-tested algorithms and (c) benefit from numerous possible extensions.

In this paper, we argue that, rather than just passively providing generic load distribution, traffic splitters should implement more active operations on the traffic stream, with the goal of reducing the load on the sensors. We present an active splitter architecture and three methods for improving performance. The first is early filtering/forwarding, where a fraction of the packets is processed on the splitter instead of the sensors. The second is the use of locality buffering, where the splitter reorders packets in a way that improves memory access locality on the sensors. The third is the use of cumulative acknowledgments, a method that optimizes the coordination between the traffic splitter and the sensors. Our experiments suggest that early filtering reduces the number of packets to be processed by 32 percent, giving an 8 percent increase in sensor performance, locality buffers improve sensor performance by 10-18 percent, while cumulative acknowledgments improve performance by 50-90 percent. We have also developed a prototype active splitter on an IXP1200 network processor and show that the cost of the proposed approach is reasonable.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593585","Network-level security and protection;intrusion detection and prevention.;network processors","Costs;Filtering;High-speed networks;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Optimization methods;Protocols;Prototypes;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic","buffer storage;distributed sensors;resource allocation;security of data;telecommunication security","active splitter architecture;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;load distribution;load-balancing traffic splitter;locality buffering;memory access locality;network processor;network-level protection;network-level security","","19","","39","","","Jan.-March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we examine the applicability of a cooperative architecture regarding forecasts of UIT on a more complex set-up, with hosts associated with sites geographically divided. The aim of this paper is to detail the employment of EWMA and Fibonacci forecasting techniques covering three major gaps of current prediction techniques concerning UIT: sensors employment, the use of just one prediction technique and forecasts' sharing.

"An Empirical Approach to Modeling Uncertainty in Intrusion Analysis","Xinming Ou; Rajagopalan, S.R.; Sakthivelmurugan, S.","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS, USA","Computer Security Applications Conference, 2009. ACSAC '09. Annual","20100115","2009","","","494","503","Uncertainty is an innate feature of intrusion analysis due to the limited views provided by system monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and various types of logs. Attackers are essentially invisible in cyber space and monitoring tools can only observe the symptoms or effects of malicious activities. When mingled with similar effects from normal or non-malicious activities they lead intrusion analysis to conclusions of varying confidence and high false positive/negative rates. This paper presents an empirical approach to the problem of uncertainty where the inferred security implications of low-level observations are captured in a simple logical language augmented with certainty tags. We have designed an automated reasoning process that enables us to combine multiple sources of system monitoring data and extract highly-confident attack traces from the numerous possible interpretations of low-level observations. We have developed our model empirically: the starting point was a true intrusion that happened on a campus network that we studied to capture the essence of the human reasoning process that led to conclusions about the attack. We then used a Datalog-like language to encode the model and a Prolog system to carry out the reasoning process. Our model and reasoning system reached the same conclusions as the human administrator on the question of which machines were certainly compromised. We then automatically generated the reasoning model needed for handling Snort alerts from the natural-language descriptions in the Snort rule repository, and developed a Snort add-on to analyze Snort alerts. Keeping the reasoning model unchanged, we applied our reasoning system to two third-party data sets and one production network. Our results showed that the reasoning model is effective on these data sets as well. We believe such an empirical approach has the potential of codifying the seemingly ad-hoc human reasoning of uncertain events, and can yield useful to- ols for automated intrusion analysis.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3919-5","","10.1109/ACSAC.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380706","intrusion detection;logic;uncertainty","Application software;Computer security;Computerized monitoring;Data mining;Data security;Forensics;Humans;Intrusion detection;Production systems;Uncertainty","inference mechanisms;security of data","Datalog-like language;Prolog system;Snort add-on;Snort alerts;Snort rule repository;ad hoc human reasoning;automated intrusion analysis;automated reasoning process;intrusion detection system;logical language;malicious activities;natural language description;reasoning model;reasoning system;system monitoring data;system monitoring tools;uncertain events;uncertainty","","3","","22","","","7-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evading these attacks has created a lot of attention from researchers. A number of monitoring and filtering devices have been developed to verify the authenticity of the packets based on the packet payload data in intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, the methods used for IDS cannot be deployed in DDoS filters since in DDoS attacks, a lot of packets arrive in a short span of time and deriving packet payload patterns become cumbersome with these IDS algorithms. This paper presents a three-level mechanism to distinguish attack packets from legitimate ones by scanning the payload of the packet. Packet patterns are derived by using the eigen vector concept and the obtained patterns are compared using an optimal string matching algorithm. This three-level filter was tested in the ANTS active network tool kit with the 1999 DARPA IDS dataset as the back end. Results validate the proposed scheme's efficiency and the time complexity of the filter proposed is smaller than IDS payload scanning methodologies.","","978-1-4244-2927-1","978-1-4244-2928-8","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809140","ANTS;Anomaly detection;Distributed Denial of Service attack;Eigen Vector;Payload modeling;String matching","Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer security;Detectors;Filtering;Filters;Intrusion detection;Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","Internet;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;message authentication;string matching;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;active network;distributed denial-of-service attack;eigen vector;flooding attack;intrusion detection system;optimal string matching algorithm;packet authenticity;packet payload data;payload driven security model","","1","1","11","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide protection against simultaneous attacks across a wide range of applications and protocols, however, such puzzles must be placed at a layer common to all of them; the network layer. Placing puzzles at the IP layer fundamentally changes the service paradigm of the Internet, allowing any device within the network to push load back onto those it is servicing. An advantage of network layer puzzles over previous puzzle mechanisms is that they can be applied to all traffic from malicious clients, making it possible to defend against arbitrary attacks as well as making previously voluntary mechanisms mandatory. In this paper, we outline goals which must be met for puzzles to be deployed effectively at the network layer. We then describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a system that meets these goals by supporting efficient, fine-grained control of puzzles at the network layer. In particular, we describe modifications to existing puzzle protocols that allow them to work at the network layer, a hint-based hash-reversal puzzle that allows for the generation and verification of fine-grained puzzles at line speed in the fast path of high-speed routers, and an iptables implementation that supports transparent deployment at arbitrary locations in the network.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498523","","Communication system traffic control;Computer crime;Control systems;Filtering;IP networks;Protection;Protocols;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical);Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;cryptography;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","DDoS;IP layer;Internet;arbitrary location;client puzzles;distributed denial of service attack;fine-grained puzzle;high-speed routers;hint-based hash-reversal puzzle;network layer;network traffic;protocols","","14","28","56","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Presently network monitoring requires the hardware component regeneration tap for packet duplication and this component needs to be present in several network points. The above tap will do un-conditional packet duplication which is in-efficient. This also makes the analyzing devices do overwork in inspecting the packets. This paper thus brings out some of the in-efficiencies in the existing network monitoring systems and justifies an alternate method for doing the same. It presents a suggestive fresh view on the factors that could prove instrumental in improving monitoring of enterprise data networks by re-using some of the forwarding capabilities in the network nodes.

In this paper, we introduce a programmable, multi-purpose network platform called C-GEP that is based on a reconfigurable architecture. The system consists of two main building blocks: a high performance FPGA-based custom hardware platform and a firmware dedicated for network monitoring. We present the architecture focusing on the system-level integration of specific packet processors. The integration of processing building blocks into one high performance system has great challenges. These are primarily related to specific, limiting factors of system resources - which we discuss also in this paper.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140417","100 Gbit/s Ethernet;Field Programmable Gate Array;network management;network monitoring;reconfigurable hardware;traffic analysis","Computer architecture;Engines;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Monitoring;Protocols;Synchronization","computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;field programmable gate arrays;firmware;packet switching;parallel architectures;protocols;reconfigurable architectures","C-GEP;FPGA-based custom hardware platform;adaptive network management;field programmable gate array;firmware;high performance networking;multipurpose network;network monitoring equipment;packet processing;programmable networks;protocol;reconfigurable architecture;reconfigurable hardware;specific packet processor;system level integration","","1","","19","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years we have experienced a wave of DDoS attacks threatening the welfare of the Internet. These are launched by malicious users whose pure incentive is to degrade the performance of other, innocent, users. The traditional systems turn out to be quite vulnerable to these attacks. The objective of this work is to take a first step to close this fundamental gap, aiming at laying a foundation that can be used in future computer/network designs taking into account the malicious users. Our approach is based on proposing a metric that evaluates the vulnerability of a system. We then evaluate the commonly used data structure in network mechanisms, the hash data structure, using our vulnerability metric. We show that a Closed Hash is much more vulnerable than an Open Hash to DDoS attacks, even though the two systems are considered to be equivalent via traditional performance evaluation. We also apply the metric to queueing mechanisms common to computer and communications systems. Lastly we apply it to the practical case of a hash table whose requests are controlled by a queue, showing that even after the attack has ended, the regular users still suffer from performance degradation or even a total denial of service.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509893","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Computer networks;Computer science;Data structures;Degradation;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Web server","Internet;data structures;queueing theory;telecommunication security","DDoS attack;Internet;distributed denial of service;hash data structure;queueing mechanism","","6","","15","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the impact of regex decompositions on the storage efficiency is well-known, little has been done to address the correctness and completeness. We show that regex decompositions can result in false positives if overlaps between subexpressions are not taken into account. We describe formal methods to recognize various types of subexpression overlaps that can arise in regex decompositions. We also describe efficient post-processing techniques to eliminate the associated false positives. To enable efficient mapping of the decomposed regexs to the postprocessors, we propose integer programming based register allocation methods. Our methods pack narrow variables to reduce the register and instruction usage, and take advantage of multi-register reset instructions to reduce the number of instructions that must be executed in parallel.

This paper proposes a new clustering algorithm, which continuously models a data stream. A set of features is used to represent the characteristics of an activity. For each feature, the clusters of feature values corresponding to activities observed so far in an audit data stream are identified by the proposed clustering algorithm for data streams. As a result, without maintaining any historical activity of a user physically, new activities of the user can be continuously reflected to the on-going result of clustering.","","0-7695-2297-1","","10.1109/SERA.2005.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563165","","Clustering algorithms;Communications technology;Computer crime;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Data analysis;Data mining;Intrusion detection;Security;Virtual manufacturing","data mining;pattern clustering;security of data","anomaly intrusion detection;audit data set;data mining techniques;data stream clustering","","1","1","17","","","11-13 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The attack launched towards the security systems are increasing in a rapid way. The sophistication of attack methods with more automated tools enables the attackers to gain control over the systems and produce threats to the information assets. The normal way of detecting the attacks is by using tools that produce alerts to the system administrators. But most of the attacks would normally escape from these tools since they are mostly rule-based. So the need for enhanced attack detection methods becomes vital for the security infrastructure. The attack detection methods are normally statistical based or probabilistic based. This paper focuses on attack detection using multiple learning based classifiers such as J48, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Random Tree, KStar, RotationForest, RandomSubspace, Ordinal Class Classifier, Data Near BalancedND and Multiclass classifier. Correlation Based Feature Selection (CFS) is also used to select the best features of the kddcup 99 dataset for the attack classes such as DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L.

Empirical studies show that as the rule set grows larger, power consumption and delay time for processing IP Packets particularly on Hardware firewalls increases extremely, and, therefore the performance of the firewall decreases proportionally. This paper present a new FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) based firewall with high performance, high processing speed, low power consumption, and low space utilization in contrast with early submitted paper in some of credible international conferences. First of all, we use Embedded Memories of FPGA instead of external memories, to increase the processing speed and to decrease the mass of signaling and noise creation in connection between FPGA and external memories. Moreover, we have applied pipeline technique to the architecture, and so we achieved high processing speed in addition to low power consumption. Based on this model, only the security rules are updated by admin during the configuration process while other hardware part would remain unchanged. The proposed architecture is written in VHDL standard language and it is simulated and synthesized with ALTERA QUARTUS II software. Finally, for validation of proposed architecture, we implemented the synthesized code on 3 of ALTERA FPGAs families (STRATIX III, CYCLONE III, CYCLONE II), and then results have been compared with earlier results.","","978-1-4244-8862-9","978-0-9564263-6-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678545","","Fires;Hardware;Pipelines;Radiation detectors;Random access memory;Registers;Synchronization","IP networks;authorisation;computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;hardware description languages;low-power electronics;system-on-chip","ALTERA QUARTUS II software;FPGA;IP packet;SOC;VHDL;configuration process;field programmable gate array;hardware firewall implementation;pipeline technique;power consumption","","0","","17","","","8-11 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Grid-specific attacks are different from traditional ones, and traditional HIDS can not recognize a grid user and always with high performance overhead. This paper proposes a grid-specific host-based intrusion detection system (GHIDS) which employs bottleneck verification approach to detect intrusions with low false alarm rate and high detection rate. Working within operating system kernel and performing bottleneck verification by integer comparison, GHIDS achieves high efficiency and accuracy. Security reports generated by GHIDS are indexed not only by local user ID, but also by grid user ID.

Symposium on","20081117","2005","","","105","113","New network applications like intrusion detection systems and packet-level accounting require multi-match packet classification, where all matching filters need to be reported. Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have been adopted to solve the multi-match classification problem due to their ability to perform fast parallel matching. However, TCAM is expensive and consumes large amounts of power. None of the previously published multi-match classification schemes is both memory and power efficient. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme that meets both requirements by using a new Set Splitting Algorithm (SSA). The main idea of SSA is that it splits filters into multiple groups and performs separate TCAM lookups into these groups. It guarantees the removal of at least half the intersections when a filter set is split into two sets, thus resulting in low TCAM memory usage. SSA also accesses filters in the TCAM only once per packet, leading to low power consumption. We compare SSA with two best known schemes: MUD [1] and Geometric Intersection- based solutions [2]. Simulation results based on the SNORT filter sets show that SSA uses approximately the same amount of TCAM memory as MUD, but yields a 75% to 95% reduction in power consumption. Compared with Geometric Intersection-based solutions, SSA uses 90% less TCAM memory and power at the cost of one additional TCAM lookup per packet.","","978-1-59593-082-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675270","TCAM;energy-efficient design;multiple-match;packet classification","Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Indexes;Matched filters;Memory management;Multiuser detection;Power demand","computer networks;content-addressable storage;packet switching;power aware computing;security of data;telecommunication network routing","geometric intersection-based solutions;intrusion detection systems;matching filters;memory efficient scheme;multimatch packet classification;network applications;packet-level accounting;parallel matching;power consumption;power efficient scheme;set splitting algorithm;ternary content addressable memories","","0","","29","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To illustrate how the functionality and control mechanism of DCs can be harnessed to solve real network traffic problems, the DCs inspired model (DCML) for intrusion detection is presented.

Detecting such attacks is especially challenging because most system owners and system administrators use networks to remotely manage the systems they are responsible for. In previous work, we introduced the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS) that has a scalable architecture to deal with such threats. This system uses low level human-specified and manually-entered rules to protect networked applications from disgruntled privileged users. However, rule-based systems are generally difficult to maintain when the number of rules is too large. This paper addresses this problem by allowing human beings to enter a smaller number of high-level rules that are automatically translated into one or more low-level rules based on an analysis of the incoming network traffic. The paper discusses how various high level rules (HLR) can detect new unwanted behaviors without any user intervention. Experiments conducted on three types of applications -- FTP, database, and Web -- show that the enhanced AVPS can detect known and unknown insider attacks through high level rules and process automation.","","978-1-4673-2067-2","","10.1109/SERE.2012.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258317","Insider threat;autonomic computing;network security;privileged user;self-protection","Automation;Databases;Humans;Monitoring;Organizations;Security;Servers","","","","0","","43","","","20-22 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results show that with Snort's patterns, the computation time of the SSF with the AC algorithm to process the Defcon9 trace is only one-third to half of that of a pure AC algorithm.

Intrusion detection systems have become the mainstream of information assurance. While firewalls and the two basic systems of cryptography (symmetric and asymmetric) do provide some protection, they do not provide complete protection and still need to be supplemented by an intrusion detection system. Most of the work done on the IDS is based on two approaches; the anomaly approach and misuse approach. Each of these approaches whether they are implemented in HIDS or NIDS have weaknesses. To respond these limitations, we propose a new way of seeing in intrusion detection systems. This vision can be described as follows: ""Instead of taking and analyzing each attack separately one from the other (have several signature for each type of attack knowing that there is various attacks and several variant of these attacks) or, instead of analyzing log files of the system, so why not see the consequences of these attacks and try to ensure that the security properties affected by these attacks will not be compromise"". To do so, we will take the language which is realized by Jonathan Rouzauld Cornabas to modelize the system's entities to protect. This paper represents only the idea on which we will base on, in order to design an effective IDS in the operating system running in user space.","","","","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237318","intrusion detection system;realtime system;security;security properties","Access control;Computational modeling;Computers;Databases;Intrusion detection;Operating systems","cryptography;firewalls;information systems;operating systems (computers)","IDS;anomaly approach;cryptography;firewalls;information assurance;information systems;intrusion detection system;misuse approach;operating system;security properties","","0","","","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"An Intrusion Surveillance System to Detect IRC-based DDoS Attacks","Yang Xiang; Wanlei Zhou","Sch. of Eng. & Inf. Technol., Deakin Univ.","Computing in the Global Information Technology, 2006. ICCGI '06. International Multi-Conference on","20070312","2006","","","65","65","Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks has been a serious threat on security of the current Internet. Recently there is a trend that many DDoS attacks utilize Internet relay chat (IRC) infrastructures as the communication channels. In this paper we propose an intrusion surveillance system (ISS) to detect IRC-based DDoS attacks. The main functions of ISS are to observe network conditions, gather intelligence from distributed sources, and determine what potential attacks will likely happen. We give the detailed design of ISS in this paper. We also implement this system by using a new approach of text-based decision making - distributed preference-based surveillance (DPBS) algorithm. By experiments we demonstrate that this distributed algorithm can effectively identify potential IRC-based DDoS attacks based on the information from different locations","","0-7695-2690-X","0-7695-2690-X","10.1109/ICCGI.2006.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4124084","","Communication channels;Communication system security;Computer crime;Decision making;Distributed algorithms;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Relays;Surveillance;Web and internet services","Internet;computer crime;distributed algorithms;electronic messaging;surveillance","IRC-based DDoS attacks;Internet relay chat infrastructures;communication channels;distributed algorithm;distributed denial of service attacks;distributed preference-based surveillance algorithm;intrusion surveillance system;text-based decision making","","0","","21","","","Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless ad hoc networks are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks (DoS) due to their open decentralized architecture, highly dynamic topology and shared wireless medium in which they exist. One of the primary concerns with respect to ad hoc networks is to provide secure communication among mobile nodes in a hostile environment. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection and response system called Routeguard. Routeguard employs a smart and smooth architecture in order to effectively discover malicious nodes and then proceeds to protect the network. The presented intrusion detection scheme produces a more natural system, which is more capable of dealing with malicious or suspected nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that this scheme improves network throughput by smartly classifying the nodes into different categories depending on their current actions and previous history.","","0-7803-9181-0","","10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512922","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computer crime;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network topology;Protection;Throughput;Wireless networks","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;telecommunication security","Routeguard;communication security;denial of service attacks;dynamic topology;intrusion detection;mobile ad hoc networks;network throughput improvement;response system","","2","","20","","","22-24 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used to detect the intrusion. Its prime function is to detect the intrusion and respond in timely manner. In other words, IDS function is limited to detection as well as response. The IDS is unable to capture the state of the system when an intrusion is detected. Hence, it fails to preserve the evidences against the attack in original form. To maintain the completeness and reliability of evidence for later examination, new security strategy is very much needed. In this research work, automated Digital Forensic Technique with Intrusion Detection System is proposed. Once an IDS detects an intrusion, it sends an alert message to administrator followed by invoke the digital forensic tool to capture the state of the system. Captured image can be used as evidence in the court of law to prove the damage.","","978-1-4673-4527-9","","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514218","Cryptography;Digital Forensic;Intrusion Detection Systems;Logs","Digital forensics;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Random access memory;Servers","digital forensics","IDS function;automated digital forensic technique;intrusion detection systems;security strategy","","0","","6","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the correct identification of threats affecting the smart grid's normal functionality must be realised, as well as what impact these threats can have so appropriate countermeasures are implemented. In this paper a list of vulnerabilities that weaken the smart grid is outlined. Also structured analysis of attacks regarding the three key security objectives across the different layers is presented along with appropriate examples applicable to the smart grid infrastructure and what impact each of them has to the smart grid on each case. Finally, a set of new attack scenarios that focus on attacks being initiated from the smart home part of the smart grid is described targeting these security objectives with the potential consequences they can cause to the smart grid.","","978-1-4799-8728-3","","10.1109/CYBER.2015.7288228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7288228","Attacks;Availability;Confidentiality;Information Security;Integrity;Smart Grid;Threats;Vulnerabilities","Density estimation robust algorithm;Floods;Least squares approximations;Protocols;Security;Smart grids;Smart meters","power system security;smart power grids","attack scenarios;correct threat identification;future threats framework;key security objectives;normal functionality;potential vulnerability identification;smart grid domain","","","","","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Framework for Zombie Detection Using Neural Networks","Salvador, P.; Nogueira, A.; Franca, U.; Valadas, R.","Inst. de Telecomun., Univ. of Aveiro, Aveiro","Internet Monitoring and Protection, 2009. ICIMP '09. Fourth International Conference on","20090619","2009","","","14","20","One of the most important threats to personal and corporate Internet security is the proliferation of zombie PCs operating as an organized network. Zombie detection is currently performed at the host level and/or network level, but these options have some important drawbacks: antivirus, anti-spyware and personal firewalls are ineffective in the detection of hosts that are compromised via new or target-specific malicious software, while network firewalls and intrusion detection systems were developed to protect the network from external attacks but they were not designed to detect and protect against vulnerabilities that are already present inside the local area network. This paper presents a new approach, based on neural networks, that is able to detect zombie PCs based on the historical traffic profiles presented by ""licit"" and ""illicit"" network applications. The evaluation of the proposed methodology relies on traffic traces obtained in a controlled environment and composed by licit traffic measured from normal activity of network applications and malicious traffic synthetically generated using the subseven backdoor. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology is able to achieve good identification results, being at the same time computationally efficient and easy to deploy in real network scenarios.","","978-1-4244-3839-6","978-0-7695-3612-5","10.1109/ICIMP.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076342","Zombie;botnet;illicit traffic;neural network","Communication system traffic control;Electronic mail;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Local area networks;Neural networks;Personal communication networks;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Unsolicited electronic mail","Internet;invasive software;local area networks;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","corporate Internet security;historical traffic profiles;illicit network application;licit network application;local area network;malicious software;neural networks;personal Internet security;subseven backdoor;zombie PC;zombie detection","","4","","21","","","24-28 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such type of request, it requires security and privacy for the underlying routing protocol. As it is a communications less and source limit network, it is very important to propose secure based energy efficient routing protocol. In order to provide a secure and energy efficient routing protocol, a Privacy Protecting Secure and Energy Efficient Routing Protocol (PPSEER) is proposed. In this protocol, first the classifications of network node take place based on their energy level. After that encryption is done based on group signature. It includes additional secure parameter such as secret key and maximum transmission power which is known only to the sender and recipient node. The advantage of the proposed routing protocol is that it increases privacy of the message as well as it maintains the energy efficiency of the node.","","978-1-4799-4191-9","","10.1109/ICCICCT.2014.6992982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6992982","AdHoc;Group Signature;Manet;PPSEER;PRISM","Ad hoc networks;Energy efficiency;Privacy;Routing;Routing protocols;Security","ad hoc networks;cryptographic protocols;energy conservation;routing protocols;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","ad hoc network;encryption;group signature;maximum transmission power;network node;privacy protecting secure;recipient node;secret key;secure parameter;security based energy efficient routing protocol;sender node;underlying routing protocol","","0","","11","","","10-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It identifies unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer systems by both system insiders and external penetrators. IDS's are based on the belief that an intruder's behavior will be noticeably different from that of a legitimate user. Many IDS has been designed and implemented using various techniques like Data Mining, Fuzzy Logic, Neural Network etc. This paper investigates the problem of existing normal Data Mining Techniques which is not efficient enough for the IDS performance.

Right setting parameters are very crucial to learning results and generalization ability of SVM. But empirical parameters are used frequently in SVM RFE, this has hampered its efficiency in practical application. Artificial immunisation algorithm (AIA) is a new intelligent algorithm which integrates global search with local search, and can effectively overcome the prematurity and slow convergence speed of traditional genetic algorithm. To improve the capability of the SVM classifier, The artificial immunisation algorithm is applied to optimize the parameter of SVM in this paper. The experimental result shows that the intrusion detection based on support vector machines improved by artificial immunisation algorithm can give higher recognition accuracy than the general SVM.","","978-1-4244-4994-1","","10.1109/ICIECS.2009.5366324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366324","","Computer science;Data security;Educational institutions;Information science;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","genetic algorithms;security of data;support vector machines","SVM;artificial immunisation algorithm;genetic algorithm;intrusion detection;support vector machines","","1","","15","","","19-20 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This moves automation networks from outdated, proprietary, closed networks to the more current arena of Information Technology (IT). However, while gaining all of the cost and performance benefits of IT, existing IT security challenges are acquired as well. The power grid automation network has inherent security risks due to the fact that the systems and applications in the network were not originally designed for the general IT environment. In this paper, we propose a conceptual layered framework for protecting power grid automation systems against cyber attacks. The following factors are taken into account: 1) integration with existing, legacy systems in a non-intrusive fashion; 2) desirable performance in terms of modularity, scalability, extendibility, and manageability; 3) alignment to the Â¿Roadmap to Secure Control Systems in the Energy SectorÂ¿ and the future intelligent power delivery systems.
