"Towards Cooperative Self-Protecting Mobile Devices using Trustful Relationships","Grob, S.","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Technische Univ.

Especially in the mobile area there are many security issues that have not yet been satisfactorily addressed, let alone been solved. Most of the security mechanisms and techniques used in wired networks tend to rely upon a fixed network topology. For example, firewalls and intrusion detection systems are placed at central points of a network and configured with a model of the network's structure to control and analyse the data flows transferred for harmful content. If at all, adopting these measures for the mobile world is not easy due to its dynamically changing environments and the mobile device's resource constraints that do not allow demanding analyse tasks. In this paper, we present our work in progress of developing a system architecture for cooperative and self-protecting mobile devices. Our approach is based on the assumption that a mobile network can be protected by securing all participating devices or at least all honest participating devices. Thus, we no longer insist on a global view of the network but on several local views. To make these views as precise as possible and to avoid serious performance bottlenecks on a single device we propose a strategy for coupling trusted mobile devices together into a cooperating group","","1-4244-0423-1","1-4244-0423-1","10.1109/SECCOMW.2006.359542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4198802","","Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Intrusion detection;Mobile computing;Network topology;Protection;Virtual private networks","mobile computing;mobile handsets;security of data;telecommunication network topology","cooperative self-protecting mobile devices;firewalls;intrusion detection systems;mobile network;network topology;security issues;trustful relationships","","0","","39","","","Aug. 28 2006-Sept. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system consists of several sets of a camera and a PC (personal computer) connected via network. Prior to the monitoring, a system manager will set up several sensitive planes in the world using a GUI (graphical user interface). To detect the intruding objects, images taken by the cameras are compared with a maintained background image using PISC (peripheral increment sign correlation) method. Then the contour of the object region on a image is traced and transformed to the coordinate of sensitive plane. If the intruding object exceeds the sensitive plane, the contours from each PC would have some common regions. This system does not reconstruct the shape of the object, but the system is able to handle 3D (three-dimensional) protection volumes because multiple sensitive planes can be set arbitrary. This system does not require us to calibrate the camera because this system is based on 2D (two-dimensional) homography.","","0-7803-7987-X","","10.1109/MFI-2003.2003.1232673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232673","","Cameras;Computerized monitoring;Face detection;Graphical user interfaces;Humans;Image reconstruction;Intrusion detection;Object detection;Robustness;Shape","computer vision;graphical user interfaces;image recognition;image sensors;monitoring;object detection;safety systems","2D homography;3D protection volume;GUI;PC network;PISC method;camera calibration;contour-based multiplanar visual hull;graphical user interface;intrusion detection;multiple sensitive plane;object shape reconstruction;peripheral increment sign correlation;two-dimensional","","0","","3","","","30 July-1 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Harnessing the Power of P2P Systems for Fast Attack Signature Validation","Antonatos, S.; Vu Quang Hieu","Inst. of Comput. Sci., Found. for Res. & Technol.

Third International Conference on","20091110","2009","","","107","114","Attack signature validation plays a key role in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar to the attack traffic (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P2P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and store recent network traffic at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of traffic that needs to be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over stored traffic data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","978-0-7695-3838-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5318955","P2P defenses;indexing;signature validation","Computer science;Computer security;Computer worms;Cryptography;Databases;Filters;Intrusion detection;Power system security;Telecommunication traffic;Testing","digital signatures;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing","P2P system;attack signature validation;intrusion detection;legitimate traffic;network traffic;security software;signature dissemination;software worm","","0","","14","","","19-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multiplexed bus is needed for HIPS (Host-based Intrusion Prevention System) in 4G mobile communications. Because an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) has been used for the multiplexed bus, there is a problem where it doesn't work at over 1 GHz. Then, the use of the FPGA leads to increase in power consumption. In this work, by using 180 nm C-MOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) technology, waved-shift registers necessary for the multiplexed bus are developed. Furthermore, the comparative evaluations of the waved-shift registers are executed by using the conventional shift register that operates at 2GHz. As a result, the waved-shift registers are revealed to have surpassed all the points of throughput, power consumption and area.","","","","10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6925898","4G mobile communications;C-MOS;multiplexed bus;network security;shift register;wave-pipeline","Application specific integrated circuits;Clocks;Field programmable gate arrays;Lead;Mobile communication;Modems;Registers","4G mobile communication;CMOS integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;multiplexing;shift registers;telecommunication security","180 nm CMOS technology;4G mobile communications;FPGA;HIPS;complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology;field-programmable gate array;frequency 1 GHz;frequency 2 GHz;host-based intrusion prevention system;multiplexed bus;waved-shift register evaluation","","1","","9","","","19-21 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection methods can be differentiated in signature-based and anomaly-based systems. While the former ones search for well-known patterns which are available in a database, the latter ones build a model of the normal behavior of a network and later on attacks can be detected by measuring significant deviation of the network status against the normal behavior described by the model. Often this requires the availability of the payload of the network packets. If encryption protocols like SSL or SSH are used, searching for attack signatures in the payload is not possible any longer and also the usage of behavior based techniques is limited: Statistical methods like flow evaluation can be used for anomaly detection, but application level attacks hidden in the encrypted traffic can be undetectable. At the moment, only a few systems are designed to cope with encrypted network traffic. Even so, none of these systems can be easily deployed in general because of the need for protocol modifications, special infrastructures or because of high false alarm rates which are not acceptable in a production environment. In this paper, we propose a new IDS for encrypted traffic which identifies command sequences in encrypted network traffic and evaluates the attack possibility of them. The encrypted traffic is clustered and possibilities for different commands are calculated. Based on that, command sequences are analysed. The system evaluates probabilities for commands and command sequences and the likeliness for an attack based on the identified sequences without a decryption of the packets. Because of only using statistical data gathered from the network traffic, the system can be deployed in general. The current prototype of the system focuses on the command evaluation.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","978-0-7695-4159-4","10.1109/NSS.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635554","Command Evaluation;Encryption;IDS;Intrusion Detection;Network Security;Remote Sessions;SSH;Statistical Analysis","Encryption;Monitoring;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","cryptographic protocols;digital signatures","anomaly-based systems;encrypted remote sessions;encrypted traffic;encryption protocols;intrusion detection systems;malicious code;signature-based system;statistical methods","","3","","23","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Optimal XOR hashing for a linearly distributed address lookup in computer networks","Martinez, C.J.; Wei-Ming Lin; Patel, P.","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Symposium on","20081117","2005","","","203","210","Hashing algorithms have been widely adopted to provide a fast address look-up process which involves a search through a large database to find a record associated with a given key. Modern examples include address-lookup in network routers for a forwarding outgoing link, rule-matching in intrusion detection systems comparing incoming packets with a large database, etc. Hashing algorithms involve transforming a key inside each target data to a hash value hoping that the hashing would render the database a uniform distribution with respect to this new hash value. When the database are already key-wise uniformly distributed, any regular hashing algorithm would easily lead to perfectly uniform distribution after the hashing. On the other hand, if records in the database are instead not uniformly distributed, then different hashing functions would lead to different performance. This paper addresses the case when such distribution follows a natural negative linear distribution, which is found to approximate distributions in many various applications. For this distribution, we derive a general formula for calculating the distribution variance produced by any given non-overlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing function. Such a distribution variance from the hashing directly translates to performance variations in searching. In this paper, the best XOR hashing function is determined for any given key size and any given hashing target size.","","978-1-59593-082-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675280","address lookup;computer networks;hashing;internet;intrusion detection;network security;packet matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed databases;IP networks;Information retrieval;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Permission;Secure storage","computer networks;file organisation;information retrieval;statistical distributions","computer network;large database search;linearly distributed address lookup;natural negative linear distribution;nonoverlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing algorithm;uniform distribution","","2","","10","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an algorithm based on Bitmap which can detect stealthy superpoints. The algorithm includes online module and offline module. The online module consists of two submodules. One uses a bloom filter to filter the duplicate packets and store the source addresses. The other uses two-dimensional bit arrays to process packets. The offline estimates the cardinality. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our algorithm can precisely detect stealthy superpoints and estimate their cardinalities.","","978-1-4799-5078-2","","10.1109/DASC.2014.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945711","Bitmap;Stealthy superpoints;host cardinality","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Estimation;Indexes;Internet","Internet;computer crime;computer network security;peer-to-peer computing","Bloom filter;Internet host;attackers identification;bitmap-based algorithm;duplicate packets;host cardinality;intrusion systems;offline module;online module;peers;process packets;source addresses;stealthy superpoint detection;two-dimensional bit arrays","","0","","14","","","24-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A static scheduler precedes the cache modules and determines what types of traffic should be forwarded to which module. We also propose several optimizations for each of the modules, such that the storage and memory overhead are minimized. We evaluate the proposed system by performing a trace driven emulation.

We demonstrate how a security layer can be added within the network communication controller in modern time-triggered systems, without introducing additional latency or processing overheads. This allows critical communications to be secured in a manner that is transparent to the processors in the electronic control units (ECUs), while also safeguarding network communication properties.","","978-1-4799-6244-0","","10.1109/FPT.2014.7082788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7082788","","Automotive engineering;Encryption;Field programmable gate arrays;Protocols;Synchronization;Vehicles","automotive electronics;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays","FPGAs;electronic control units;network communication controller;time-triggered automotive networks;zero latency encryption","","1","","22","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information Gain and Chi-square methods are used to rank the importance of 41 attributes extracted from the network traffic with our programs. Bayesian networks as well as C4.5 are then employed to detect attacks as well as to determine what size of attributes is appropriate for fast detection. Empirical results show that only using the most important 9 attributes, the detection accuracy remains the same or even has some improvements compared with that of using all the 41 attributes based on Bayesian Networks and C4.5 methods.

Our analysis show that these features have remarkably different values for benign and malicious processes; as a result, a number of classifiers operating on these features provide 93% detection accuracy with 0% false alarm rate within 100 milliseconds. Last but not the least, we justify that it is very difficult for a crafty attacker to evade these low-level system specific features.","1550-3607","978-1-61284-232-5","978-1-61284-231-8","10.1109/icc.2011.5963012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963012","","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Kernel;Linux;Malware;Time series analysis;Training","Linux;invasive software;operating system kernels;program diagnostics;task analysis;time series","Linux kernel module;Linux process;Linux task structure;benign process;executing program behavior;in-execution malware detection;low-level system specific feature;malicious process;operating system kernel;process classification;process kernel structure;processing overhead;run-time analysis;time series analysis","","2","","17","","","5-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these techniques need a large number of self elements to build the profile and lack adaptability. Aiming at the problems of traditional techniques, an immunity-based dynamic method for network anomaly detection, referred to as WAD, is proposed in this paper. WAD builds an appropriate profile using only a subset of normal elements and adapts the varieties of self and non-self space, which adjust adaptively the self radius, the detection radius, and numbers of detectors to amend the built profile. The experiment results show that WAD is an efficient solution to anomaly detection, and has the features of high detection rate, low false alarm rate, self-learning, and adaptation.","","978-1-4244-1747-6","978-1-4244-1748-3","10.1109/ICBBE.2008.157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4535037","","Biology;Computational Intelligence Society;Computer science;Computer security;Computer vision;Detectors;Immune system;Space technology;Sun;Training data","computer networks;security of data","WAD method;immunity based dynamic anomaly detection;network anomaly detection;self elements","","1","","17","","","16-18 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new IDS alert correlation method to detect attack scenarios in real-time. The proposed method is based on causal approach due to the strength of causal methods in practice. Most of causal methods can be deployed offline but not in real-time due to time and memory limitations. In the proposed method the knowledge base of attack patterns is represented in a graph model called Causal Relations Graph. In offline, we construct some trees related to alerts probable correlations. In real-time for each received alert, we can find its correlations with previously received alerts by performing a search only in the corresponding tree. Thus processing time of each alert decreases significantly. In addition, the proposed method is immune to the deliberately slowed attacks. To verify the proposed method, it was implemented in C++ and we used DARPA2000 dataset to test it. Experimental results show the correctness of the proposed alert correlation and its efficiency with respect to the run time.","","978-1-4673-2387-1","","10.1109/ISCISC.2012.6408197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6408197","Alert;Alert Correlation;Attack;Attack Scenario;Graph;Intrusion;Intrusion Detection System","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;IP networks;Knowledge based systems;Memory management;Real-time systems;Security","C++ language;computer network security;knowledge based systems;real-time systems;trees (mathematics)","C++ implementation;DARPA 2000 dataset;IDS alert correlation method;attack patterns;causal approach;causal methods;causal relations graph;graph model;intrusion detection alert correlation;intrusion detection systems;knowledge base representation;real-time attack scenario detection;trees","","1","","20","","","13-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most frequent attacks is Denial of Service (DoS), which can easily be generated but its detection is not trivial. In this paper, a framework is proposed to detect Denial of Service attacks and other forms of intrusions, then generate responses accordingly. Our proposed detection engine combines the specification- and anomaly-based intrusion detection techniques.

The first question deals with how the packet loss rate affects the sensor alert rate, and the second considers how the network traffic composition affects the results of the first question. Potential places where packet loss may occur are examined by dividing the problem into network, host, and sensor based packets loss. We posit theories about how packet loss may present itself and develop the Packet Dropper that induces packet loss into a dataset. Drop rates ranging from 0% to 100% are applied to four different data sets and the resulting abridged data sets are analyzed with Snort to collect alert loss rate. Conclusions are drawn about the importance of the distribution of packet loss and the effect of the network traffic composition.","","","","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888699","Network Intrusion Detection Packet Loss","Intrusion detection;Kernel;Packet loss;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;telecommunication traffic","Packet Dropper;Snort;alert loss rate;network intrusion detection;network traffic composition;packet loss distribution;packet loss rate;sensor alert rate","","0","","16","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides an overall view of the entire network and filter/drill-down features that allow operators to request more detailed information. Preliminary reports from several organizations using this tool report increased responsiveness to security events as well as new insights into understanding the security dynamics of their networks. In this paper we focus specifically on the design decisions made during the VisFlowConnect development process so that others may learn from our experience. The current VisFlowConnect architecture - the result of these design decisions - is extensible to processing other high-volume multi-dimensional data streams where link connectivity/activity is a focus of study.

This is one reason why over 40 proposals, addressing these problems, have been published. Regrettably, not many of these researchers have considered scalability, extensibility and other performance issues by testing their promising prevention techniques in a real network. We find that there are around eight practical frameworks and the aim of this paper is to revisit these countermeasures solutions.

In many attacks against sensor networks, the first step for an attacker is to establish itself as a legitimate node within the network.

We propose a graph similarity-based approach to event detection and identification that integrates a number of techniques to collect time-varying situation information, extract correlations between event attributes, and characterize and identify security events. Diverging from the traditional rule- or statistical-based pattern matching techniques, the proposed mechanism represents security events in a graphical form of correlation networks and identifies security events through the computation of graph similarity measurements to eliminate the need for constructing user or system profiles. These technical components take fundamentally different approaches from traditional empirical or statistical methods and are designed based on rigorous computational analysis with mathematically proven performance guarantee. The performance superiority of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by extensive simulation and experimental results.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683648","","Computer security;Computers;Correlation;Data mining;Event detection;Monitoring","graph theory;knowledge based systems;pattern matching;security of data;statistical analysis","computational analysis;correlation networks;correlation techniques;cyber situation awareness;development community;event attributes;graph similarity measurements;graph similarity-based approach;network research;performance superiority;rule-based pattern matching techniques;security event analysis;security events detection;security events identification;statistical methods;statistical-based pattern matching techniques;time-varying situation information","","0","","22","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these applications, delivering information to multiple receivers at the same time makes multicast communication is the next generation dominated data transmission mechanism in mobile ad hoc networks. In spite of efficient bandwidth utilization, multicast is most vulnerable against various types of internal and Byzantine attacks. Existing Intrusion Detection Systems and attacker prevention techniques act too smart to defend these attacking strategies. Accordingly adversaries also update their attacking strategy intelligently to intervene the successful defending schemes. In our work, we present a novel intelligent internal attack on a tree-based multicast routing protocol in MANET. Intelligent adversary launches it's attacking strategy on MAC layer against collision avoidance mechanism only when it can gain more in an attack's success rate. Our simulation study observes the robustness of MAODV against this internal attacking approach. Multicast session's performance metrics such as PDR, throughput and packets drop ratio are analyzed with the presence of adversaries in the multicast group. We also examine the impact of attacker's location in the multicast tree. We design an analytical model that shows the impact of internal attack on multicast group through empirical study. Analytical results compare with NS2 simulation results that prove the validity of analytical models. This empirical study illustrates the importance of designing smarter internal attacker detection mechanism to protect multicast routing protocols from the above-mentioned intelligent internal attacks.","","978-1-4799-8466-4","","10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229740","Byzantine attacks;IDS;MANET;MAODV;attacker prevention technique;internal attacks;multicast","Analytical models;Mobile ad hoc networks;Robustness;Routing;Routing protocols;Throughput","access protocols;bandwidth allocation;computer network security;data communication;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic;trees (mathematics)","Byzantine attack;MAC layer;MANET;MAODV;bandwidth utilization;collision avoidance mechanism;denial of service attack;information delivery;intelligent internal attack;intelligent stealthy attack;intrusion detection system;mobile ad hoc network;multicast communication;multicast routing protocol;multicast tree;next generation data transmission mechanism;smarter internal attacker detection mechanism design","","0","","17","","","17-19 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, existing technologies are insufficient as primitives for end-host security. For example, Berkeley packet filter (BPF), the most popular monitoring infrastructure for many Unix systems, is intended for packet capturing at physical interfaces, and thus, not appropriate for monitoring of applications, which is sometimes critical for system security. This paper presents a simple solution to the problem, utilizing hierarchical virtual network interface (VIF) mechanism. VIF is a new OS abstraction that can be hierarchically structured and attached to OS entities to control their network I/O. We extend VIFs to allow filtering and monitoring of their traffic, and show that it has desirable properties for end-host monitoring and control of traffic. We present our prototype implementation on FreeBSD, and evaluate it qualitatively and quantitatively. Demonstrated advantages include: i) ability to monitor terminating entities at arbitrary granularity, ii) a single consistent framework for both network security and network quality of service, iii) OS independence, iv) efficiency as a control primitive, v) compatibility with BPF interface and its applications, and vi) flexibility for future functional expansion.","0743-166X","0-7803-8968-9","","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498485","","Application software;Band pass filters;Communication system traffic control;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Inspection;Intelligent networks;Peace technology;Quality of service;Traffic control","computer networks;information filters;network interfaces;quality of service;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Berkeley packet filter;Netnice packet filter;QoS;Unix systems;end-host network control;network quality of service;system security;telecommunication traffic;virtual network interface mechanism","","0","","35","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users with power credentials can do almost anything they want with the systems they own with very little control or oversight. Most breaches occurring nowadays by power users are considered legitimate access and not necessarily intrusions. Developing a solution for such a problem is challenging because power users need flexible requirements to administer or maintain their systems. The increased usage of virtual environments, virtual systems, teleworking, and remote usage has made network access the preferred method for system administration. This paper presents (1) the Autonomic Violation Prevention System (AVPS), a framework that provides a solution to this problem and meet the above mentioned challenges, and (2) a proof-of-concept prototype that embeds self-protection capabilities into traditional Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS). AVPS focuses on self-protection against security policy violations instead of malware, vulnerability, or exploit intrusions. AVPS heavily enforces separation of duties, promotes scalability, ease of use and manageability.

NIDS detects anomalies and intrusions that violate predefined security rules using a specification-based algorithm. The performance test has been conducted for different cyber intrusion scenarios (e.g., packet modification, replay and denial-of-service attacks) using a cyber security testbed. The IEEE 39-bus system model has been used for testing of the proposed intrusion detection method for simultaneous cyber attacks. The false negative ratio (FNR) is the number of misclassified abnormal packets divided by the total number of abnormal packets.

The system consists of several sets of a camera and a PC connected via network. Prior to the monitoring, a system manager would set up several sensitive planes in the world using a GUI. To detect the intruding objects, images taken by the cameras are compared with a maintained background image using PISC method. Then the contour of the object region on an image is traced and transformed to the coordinate of sensitive plane. The contours are collected to a single PC and existence of a common region is judged. If the intruding object exceeds the sensitive plane, the contours from each PC would have some common regions. If the intruder occludes the critical point on the sensitive planes from the all cameras to avoid observation, the system also alerts to the user. This system does not reconstruct the shape of the object, but the system is able to handle 3-D protection volumes because multiple sensitive planes can be set arbitrary.

However, in the FPGA, it is not able to be executed by the restriction on the structure. This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for the FPGA developed by the register-transfer level (RTL) design. Although the RTL design of the FPGA has various advantages, it is required for a high-speed design for a routing delay which is larger than that of a conventional FPGA. The method is timing adjustment using a connection block with the RTL design. Results of analysis of the connection block show that the seven stages of the delay adjustment are possible in the block. In addition, the block can be used for rough-tuning of delay times. It is the area of less than half of the logic block.","","","","10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207067","RTL design;connection block;delay times;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA);fine-tuning;low-power design;wave-pipeline","Delays;Field programmable gate arrays;Routing;Switches;Throughput;Transistors;Tuning","field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;logic design;pipeline processing","RTL design;delay time adjustment;field programmable gate arrays;high speed FPGA;low-power FPGA;pipeline operations;register transfer level design;wave pipeline fine tuning","","0","","13","","","24-27 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, how to systematically and efficiently extract protocol feature words from network traffic remains a challenging issue. Existing n-gram approaches simply break pay-load into equal-length pieces and are ineffective in capturing the hidden statistical structure of the payload content. In this paper, we propose ProWord, an unsupervised approach that extracts protocol feature words from traffic traces. ProWord builds on two nontrivial algorithms. First, we propose an unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on the modified Voting Experts algorithm, such that we break payload into candidate words according to entropy information and provide more accurate segmentation than existing n-gram approaches. Second, we propose a ranking algorithm that incorporates different types of well-known feature word retrieval heuristics, such that we can build an ordered structure on the candidate words and select the highest ranked ones as protocol feature words. We compare ProWord and existing n-gram approaches via evaluation on real-world traffic traces. We show that ProWord captures true protocol feature words more accurately and performs significantly faster.","","","","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Entropy;Feature extraction;Partitioning algorithms;Payloads;Protocols","computer network management;computer network security;feature extraction;information retrieval;protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning;word processing","ProWord;byte subsequences;deep packet analysis;entropy information;feature word retrieval heuristics;n-gram approach;network management;nontrivial algorithm;protocol feature word extraction;ranking algorithm;security system;statistical structure;traffic payload;traffic trace;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;voting expert algorithm","","3","","27","","","April 27 2014-May 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hyper visor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.","1060-9857","978-1-4577-1349-1","","10.1109/SRDS.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076761","card data flow;compliance;payment system;private cloud;virtual machine","Credit cards;Decision support systems;Kernel;Security;Sockets;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","PCI DSS compliance;card transaction processing;credit card data flow automated discovery;credit card process;intrusive instrumentation;middleware;payment card industry;payment infrastructure;personal financial transactions;private cloud environments;security compliance;source code application;virtual machine introspection technology;virtual machines;virtualized servers","","3","","29","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we firstly define the entropy-based analysis, then analyze the amount of incoming packets to our collage. As the results, we were able to extract the following features for the entropy analysis. Firstly, fluctuations for first octet aggregation lead to similar pattern compared to that of first and second octets aggregation. Secondly, sliding time of 10 minutes of entropy window was sensitive to detect anomaly accesses.

In Part I, the emphasis is on the design of an electrical control architecture for an offshore oil drilling platform powered by wind generation. Engineering a distributed control system having safety critical features, requiring real-time performance is challenging. In this follow-up article we introduce the communication framework for the microgrid scenario under investigation. In all communication networks, scholastic delays and performance are inherent. The only feasible approach is to put bounds on the random processes, qualitatively define the worst cases, and build the distributed control system to be resilient enough to tolerate those behaviors.

Battery-based attack detections can be significantly increased by investigating variable smart battery polling rates, system management bus speeds, and attack execution times. This research explores the modification of smart battery polling rates in conjunction with the variance of malicious network activity. An optimum static polling rate for each of the selected illicit network attack densities was determined by altering these two parameters.

With recent advances in the performance and viability of using GPUs for various highly-parallelised data processing tasks, a number of security challenges are raised. Unscrupulous software running subsequently on the same GPU, either by the same user, or another user, in a multi-user system, may be able to gain access to the contents of the GPU memory. This contains data from previous program executions. In certain use-cases, where the GPU is used to offload intensive parallel processing such as pattern matching for an intrusion detection system, financial systems, or cryptographic algorithms, it may be possible for the GPU memory to contain privileged data, which would ordinarily be inaccessible to an unprivileged application running on the host computer. With GPUs potentially yielding access to confidential information, existing research in the field is built upon, to investigate the practicality of extracting data from global, shared and texture memory, and retrieving this data for further analysis. These techniques are also implemented on various GPUs using three different Nvidia CUDA versions. A novel methodology for digital forensic examination of GPU memory for remanent data is then proposed, along with some suggestions and considerations towards countermeasures and anti-forensic techniques.","","","","10.1109/INM.2015.7140493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140493","","Digital forensics;Graphics processing units;Memory management;Random access memory;Remanence","digital forensics;graphics processing units;memory architecture;parallel architectures;pattern matching","CUDA graphics processing units;GPU memory;Nvidia CUDA GPU;antiforensic techniques;confidential information access;cryptographic algorithms;data remanence;data retrieval;digital forensic;financial systems;global-shared texture memory;highly-parallelised data processing tasks;host computer;intrusion detection system;memory attacks;multiuser system;offload intensive parallel processing;pattern matching;privileged data;program executions;unprivileged application","","0","","24","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although an HTTPS compatible scheme is necessary for many online services, several previously proposed defense schemes fail to combine both HTTPS compatibility with practicality. In this paper, a novel defense architecture that blocks malicious traffic far from the protected servers is proposed. Protected servers are hidden inside a secure overlay network only accessible through a set of access-nodes (AN) with rate limiting and access control functionalities. Protected servers are required to provide at least one dummy public server as an initial connection step point. An experimental prototype is implemented and tested. Results show; system compatibility with e-commerce websites needs, also, the AN impact on the protected server performance is less than 10% reduction in file transfer throughput, in addition, the public server could survive attack rates more than 10 times higher than an ordinary server. Through discussion we demonstrate the system ability to protect the servers' resources from all attack types without sacrificing data integrity or confidentiality. To the best of our knowledge, we offer the first practical DDoS protection scheme fully compatible with HTTPS.","","978-1-4244-7526-1","978-0-7695-4107-5","10.1109/SAINT.2010.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5598153","DDoS protection;access control;e-commerce;internet security;privacy","Computer crime;Floods;IP networks;Protocols;Prototypes;Web server","access control;electronic commerce;security of data","DDoS floods;Internet security;access control;access-nodes;distributed denial of service attacks;e-commerce;;malicious traffic;online businesses;overlay network","","0","","17","","","19-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ARES 08. Third International Conference on","20080523","2008","","","1188","1195","When designers and developers create software they often overlook issues related to security. Ideally, protection of the program from illegal usage would be considered at each stage of this program's life cycle. The proposition put forward here is to augment intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and employ them as a tool to support secure software development. Many state-based intrusion detection methods share structural and behavioural similarities with the set of processes known as discrete-event systems (DESs). A common structure for modelling DESs is the deterministic finite-state automaton. There exist several compatible anomaly detection techniques which construct finite- state machine models of normal behaviour through the decomposition of associated data (e.g., system calls, HTTP requests) into sequences of events. This paper proposes the application of decentralized DES theory to formally analyze and enhance these approaches to anomaly detection with misuse prevention. Models of misuse attacks are generated in the same manner as the legal usage representation, then augmented and integrated into the program model to prevent the execution of malicious sequences. The technique described herein simultaneously uses anomaly and misuse approaches to prevent and disable attacks before their completion.","","978-0-7695-3102-1","","10.1109/ARES.2008.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529478","Software security;anomaly detection;discrete-event systems;finite-state automata","Automata;Discrete event systems;Event detection;Intrusion detection;Law;Legal factors;Programming;Security;Software maintenance;Software testing","discrete event systems;finite state machines;security of data;software engineering","discrete-event systems;intrusion detection systems;legal usage representation;secure software development;software deterministic finite-state automaton","","0","","17","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers improve existing IDS models by comparing the performance of various algorithms on these datasets. It is very important to keep in mind that an IDS often has to work in a noisy network environment. Network noise is one of the most challenging issues for efficient threat detection and classification. In this study, normal and noisy datasets for network IDS domain are used and various classification algorithms are evaluated. The results show that an evaluation of algorithms without noise is misleading for IDSs since algorithms that perform best without noise do not necessarily achieve the same in a realistic noisy environment. Moreover refined NSL KDD dataset allows a more realistic evaluation of various algorithms than the original KDD 99 dataset.","","978-1-4799-3143-9","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753939","Intrusion detection;anomaly identification;classifier;false alarm;ignored attack;prediction","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Noise;Noise measurement;Prediction algorithms;Training","data mining;pattern classification;security of data","KDD 99 dataset;NSL KDD dataset;classification technique comparison;classification technique evaluation;data mining;network IDS domain;network intrusion detection system logs;noisy network environment;threat classification;threat detection","","2","","56","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel high speed long patterns matching architecture using cascade TCAMs for large signature set based NIDS is presented in this paper. Systems to handle tens of thousands of signatures with thousands of bytes length each can be built on such architecture. A novel efficient header rules matching system is proposed in this paper.

Prevention methods as cryptographic techniques alone are not sufficient to make them secure; therefore, efficient intrusion detection must be deployed and elaborated to facilitate the identification of attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aims to detect malicious and selfish nodes in a network. The intrusion detection techniques used for wired networks may no longer be effective and sufficient when adapted directly to a wireless ad-hoc network, thus existing methods of intrusion detection have to be modified and new methods have to be defined in order to work effectively and efficiency in this new network architecture. In this paper we give a survey of different architectures and methods of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for MANETs accordingly to the recent literature.","","978-1-4799-7053-7","","10.1109/WCCCS.2014.7107930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7107930","MANETs;intrusion detection systems;mobile ad hoc networks;network security","Ad hoc networks;Intrusion detection;Lead;Logic gates;Mobile computing;Monitoring","mobile ad hoc networks;telecommunication security","IDS;MANET;cryptographic techniques;intrusion detection systems;malicious attack;mobile ad hoc networks","","0","","32","","","27-28 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These shared resources, easy accessibility and shared storage of resources are responsible for putting the confidential information under a great deal of risk. Although the cloud is becoming gigantic day by day but its efficiency is being hampered considerably due to the threats in the cloud computing environment. The threats in the cloud computing environment not only account to external attacks which are launched with the intention of hampering work flow of the cloud provider but the internal attacks also which are being launched so that the efficiency and the reliability of the cloud is at stake. The firewalls monitor traffic between networks such that all the traffic must flow through it, but they are certainly not sufficient to shield the dynamic cloud computing environment from all attacks. They may be able to subvert external attacks to a certain extent but internal attacks do not even pass through the firewalls, therefore rendering them useless. Moreover, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the virtual machines in order to set up large scale attacks like Ddos. They compromise these VM's into zombies and the detection of these VM's is very difficult because cloud users install all types of applications onto their VM's some of which may be malicious. Thus, the cloud needs stronger security for handling all the intrusions of every scale. An intrusion detection system is presented in the paper which detects the intrusions launched on the VM's which act an avenue for deploying large scale attacks, therefore, minimising the loss. The IDS presented in the paper is a network IDS and provides security from the IaaS based attacks.","","978-1-4799-6928-9","","10.1109/CICN.2014.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065580","ARP;CSP;DNS;Ddos;IDS;VM","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Servers;Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;firewalls;security of data;virtual machines","cloud computing;confidential information;data loss;firewalls;intrusion detection;virtual machines;virtual networks","","0","","22","","","14-16 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
