In a highly interconnected networked environment, components with varying levels of trustworthiness must interact with each other. Occurrence and spread of attack induced failure imply that hosts once trusted cannot remain equally trusted all the time. System components and human operators can benefit from a scheme that assesses the trustworthiness of hosts i.e., the confidence that individual hosts are not corrupt, on a continuous basis by adjusting and adapting their behavior when a host's trustworthiness diminishes.

Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903456","Access control;Aspect-Oriented Programming;Cloud computing;In-lined Reference Monitors;Information flow control;Security","Access control;Cloud computing;Java;Monitoring;Programming;Runtime","aspect-oriented programming;authorisation;cloud computing;parallel programming","AOP;Hadoop MapReduce;IRM;Java binary;Java computations;OS-hypervisor;SilverLine;VM;access control policy;aspect-oriented programming;cloud edge;cloud file system;cloud kernel software;data processing cloud;in-lined reference monitors;information flow policy;inter-process information flow security;operating systems;platform-as-a-service clouds;virtual machines","","0","","60","","","11-14 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firewalls provide a false sense of security because they have inherent flaws that are continuously exploited by hackers. Current firewalls lack in providing adequate security against insiders. Literature suggests that these limitations arise from the deficiencies in firewall design. This paper presents a model of a firewall called disarming firewall. The model is composed of different components, each serving different purpose. The firewall protects against malicious insiders by limiting the attacking capabilities of each internal host. Knowing that obtaining knowledge of end systems is a precursor of an attack, the firewall hides the identity of OS and server software placed in DMZ from internal as well as external users. Another problem solved by the firewall is the general laziness in applying patches to the software. The auditing system of firewall actively monitors all systems in the perimeter and applies patches as soon as they are released.","","978-1-4244-8001-2","","10.1109/ICIET.2010.5625739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625739","Disarmed Host;Firewall;Network Security","Authentication;Fires;Internet;Monitoring;Servers;Software","authorisation;computer crime;operating systems (computers)","auditing system;disarming firewall;hackers;network security;operating system;server software","","0","","22","","","14-16 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Efficient fingerprint extraction for high performance Intrusion Detection System","Haiyang Jiang; Gaogang Xie; Salamatian, K.","Inst. of Comput. Technol., Beijing, China","Computers and Communications (ISCC), 2013 IEEE Symposium on","20140306","2013","","","000179","000184","Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) module in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes) consists of two components: Pre-filter and Rule Verification (RV). Pre-filter adopts Multi-Pattern Matching (MPM) engine to filter out the vast majority of benign packets and then leave a few suspicious packets with false positives into RV component. These false positives are due to the scanning process in the pre-filter: it detects the traffic in a single pass against a set of fingerprints, which are extracted from the given ruleset by selecting only a small portion of the patterns in each signature. RV component precisely checks the suspicious packets and eliminates these false positives. The performance of DPI module is related to the extracted fingerprint set. An efficient fingerprint set should improve the pre-filter throughput, and at the same time decrease the count of checking activities in RV component. We show in this paper that these two requirements cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the existing fingerprint extraction strategies. Pre-filter performance greatly benefits from smaller fingerprint set because of the more compact MPM engine. But RV component suffers from the higher rate of false positives caused by the smaller fingerprint set. We optimally trade off these two requirements with a new extraction method in this work. Through analysing a small amount of training traffic in the initial phase, our strategy gives each fingerprint candidate an empirical weight for the subsequent extraction. Experimental results obtained by integrating our proposed method into the Snort IDS show that our strategy improves the IDS average throughput by at least 69% over the latest real ruleset and real traffic.","","","","10.1109/ISCC.2013.6754942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754942","Fingerprint;Intrusion Detection System;Pre-filter;Snort","Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Indium phosphide;Inspection;TV","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;security of data","MPM engine;RV component;Snort IDS;fingerprint extraction strategies;high performance intrusion detection system;prefilter component;rule verification component","","0","","19","","","7-10 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To precisely detect network anomalies (with a few false alarms), an intrusion detection system requires reliable methods. A potential solution in predicting network bandwidth usage is using a time-series model with a threshold. This paper proposes a network anomaly detection technique based on SARIMA, a time-series model, to capture seasonal behavior of bandwidth usage of most networks. Our proposed SARIMA based anomaly detection is capable of detecting network bandwidth anomalies effectively when a threshold equals to 8.5 percents of maximum bandwidth in a day. Our result yields 3.57 percents of false alarms. We concluded that SARIMA is a better instrumental tool for intrusion detection comparing to ARIMA.","","978-1-4673-1920-1","","10.1109/JCSSE.2012.6261934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261934","Forecasting;Intrusion detection;SARIMA;Security","Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Computers;Equations;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Predictive models","autoregressive moving average processes;computer network security;time series","SARIMA based network bandwidth anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average;time-series model","","1","","12","","","May 30 2012-June 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Classification of computer attacks using a self-organizing map","DeLooze, L.L.","","Information Assurance Workshop, 2004. Proceedings from the Fifth Annual IEEE SMC","20050606","2004","","","365","369","As computer technology evolves and the threat of computer crimes increases, the apprehension and preemption of such violations become more and more difficult and challenging. To date, it appears that completely preventing breaches of security is unrealistic. Therefore, we must try to detect and classify these intrusions as they occur so that immediate actions may be taken to repair the damage and prevent further harm. One attempt at classifying these intrusions is MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list that provides a common name for all publicly known security weaknesses. The CVE dictionary, however, is not taxonomy. The CVE list is organized in simple numerical order by date of acceptance. Each entry in the dictionary includes a unique CVE identification number, a text description of the vulnerability and any pertinent references. Creating a self-organizing map (SOM) using the text description allows us to order attack profiles with common features in the same general area of the output space. Attacks in the general neighborhood of one another should be able to be mitigated by similar means. Plotting attacks on a SOM also enables us to visually examine the placement of an attack relative to the four common classes of attacks (Denial of Service, Deception, Reconnaissance, and Unauthorized Access). Many attacks have features in common with more than one of these classes rather than corresponding directly to a single class. We have developed an effective technique to classify new attacks using a unique taxonomy, which breaks down threats into the four general categories, and the SOM created by the baseline CVE descriptions.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437840","","Computer crime;Computer security;Data security;Databases;Dictionaries;Organizing;Reconnaissance;Software standards;Taxonomy;Web pages","authorisation;computer crime;self-organising feature maps","Kohonen map;MITRE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure;computer attack classification;computer crime;computer security;self-organizing map;taxonomy;text description","","1","","7","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, intrusion detection in the new distributed architectures is now a major requirement. In this paper, we propose two online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms. In the first algorithm, a traditional online Adaboost process is used where decision stumps are used as weak classifiers. In the second algorithm, an improved online Adaboost process is proposed, and online Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used as weak classifiers. We further propose a distributed intrusion detection framework, in which a local parameterized detection model is constructed in each node using the online Adaboost algorithm. A global detection model is constructed in each node by combining the local parametric models using a small number of samples in the node. This combination is achieved using an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines. The global model in each node is used to detect intrusions. Experimental results show that the improved online Adaboost process with GMMs obtains a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate than the traditional online Adaboost process that uses decision stumps. Both the algorithms outperform existing intrusion detection algorithms. It is also shown that our PSO, and SVM-based algorithm effectively combines the local detection models into the global model in each node; the global model in a node can handle the intrusion types that are found in other nodes, without sharing the samples of these intrusion types.","2168-2267","","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2247592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488798","Dynamic distributed detection;network intrusions;online Adaboost learning;parameterized model","","Gaussian processes;computer architecture;computer network security;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;support vector machines","GMM;PSO;SVM-based algorithm;distributed architectures;dynamic distributed network intrusion detection;local parameterized detection model;network attack detection;network information security;online Adaboost process;online Adaboost-based intrusion detection algorithms;online Adaboost-based parameterized methods;online Gaussian mixture models;particle swarm optimization;support vector machines;weak classifiers","","2","","60","","2013-03-27","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Novelty detection, the ability to identify new or previously unknown situations, is a useful ability for learning systems, especially when dealing with data streams, where concepts may appear, disappear, or evolve overtime. There are several studies currently investigating the application of novelty detection techniques in data streams. However, there is no consensus regarding how to evaluate the performance of these techniques. In this study, we propose a new evaluation methodology for multiclass novelty detection in data streams able to deal with: i) unsupervised learning, which generates novelty patterns without an association with the true classes, where one class may be composed of a novelty set, ii) confusion matrix that increases overtime, iii) confusion matrix with a column representing unknown examples, i.e., those not explained by the model, and iv) representation of the evaluation measures overtime. We propose a new methodology to associate the novelty patterns detected by the algorithm, in an unsupervised fashion, with the true classes. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology through the use of known novelty detection algorithms with artificial and real data sets.","1041-4347","","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2441713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118190","Evaluation methodologies;data streams;evaluation methodology;novelty detection","Context;Data mining;Decision support systems;Electronic mail;Mathematical model;Measurement uncertainty;Time measurement","data mining;matrix algebra;unsupervised learning","artificial data sets;confusion matrix;data stream mining;evaluation measures;evaluation methodology;knowledge extraction;learning systems;multiclass novelty detection algorithms;nonstationary distribution;novelty patterns;real data sets;true classes;unsupervised learning","","0","","47","","2015-06-04","Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among the various network security measures, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role to integrity, confidentiality and availability of resources. It seems that the presence of uncertainty and the imprecise nature of the intrusions make fuzzy systems suitable for such systems. Fuzzy systems are not normally adaptive and have not the ability to construct models solely based on the target system's sample data. One of the successful approaches which are incorporated fuzzy systems with adaptation and learning capabilities is the neural fuzzy method. The main objective of this work is to utilize ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) as a classifier to detect intrusions in computer networks. This paper evaluates performance of ANFIS in the forms of binary and multi-classifier to categorize activities of a system into normal and suspicious or intrusive activities. Experiments for evaluation of the classifiers were performed with the KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset. The Overall Results show that ANFIS can be effective in detecting various intrusions.","","978-1-4244-0219-9","978-1-4244-0220-5","10.1109/ICOCI.2006.5276608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5276608","ANFIS;Computer network Security;Intrusion Detection;KDD dataset;Neuro-Fuzzy classifier","Availability;Communication system security;Computer networks;Computer security;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Learning;Protocols","fuzzy set theory;security of data","KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer networks;network intrusion detection;neurofuzzy classification","","1","","17","","","6-8 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the session hijacking is not in the forefront of everyone mind, it still remains a commonly used attack in MANET. Session hijack attacks are defined as taking over an active TCP/IP communication session without their permission or knowledge. When implemented successfully, attackers assume the identity of the compromised user, enjoying the same access to resources as the compromised user. Network protocols like FTP, Telnet, and rlogin are especially attractive to the attacker, because of the session oriented nature of their connections, and lack of implementation of any security during login, authentication, or data transmission. We introduce a novel method for defending session hijacking attack in MANET: Pseudo Random Alteration of Sequence Numbers (PRAS). Based on the comprehensive evaluation based on simulations, it is shown that PRAS can successfully defend session hijacking under diverse mobile multi-hop network environment with low communication, computation, and memory overhead.","","","","10.1109/ICCT.2013.6820344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820344","Mobile Ad hoc Networks;Sequence number;Session hijacking;TCP attacks","Ad hoc networks;Computer crime;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Receivers;Servers","cryptographic protocols;mobile ad hoc networks;random sequences;telecommunication security;transport protocols","FTP;MANET;PRAS;TCP-IP communication session;Telnet;authentication;data transmission;diverse mobile multihop network environment;mobile ad hoc network;network protocol;pseudorandom alteration of sequence number;rlogin;security;session hijacking attack","","1","","14","","","17-19 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The IDS utilizes (1) both anomaly and misuse detection schemes to identify attacks in MANETs and (2) mobile agents (MAs) to augment each node's intrusion-detection capability.

Due to dynamic and unpredictable changing behavior of nodes, the reliable data delivery is a challenging task. For WSNs, the traditional cryptographic and authentication-based solutions cannot be adopted due to their associated cost and incapability to counter nodes misbehavior attacks. Recently, trust-based solutions have proved to be more effective to address nodes' misbehavior attacks. However, the existing solutions give rise to high energy consumption and control overheads in pursuit of trust estimation and network-wide dissemination, which not only adds to network congestion but also undermines network lifetime. In this paper, we present a trust and energy aware routing protocol (TERP) that makes use of a distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving and faulty nodes. Moreover, TERP incorporates a composite routing function that encompasses trust, residual-energy, and hopcounts of neighbor nodes in making routing decisions. This multi-facet routing strategy helps to balance out energy consumption among trusted nodes, while routing data using shorter paths. The simulation results demonstrate reduced energy consumption, improved throughout and network lifetime of TERP when compared with the existing work.","1530-437X","","","10.1109/JSEN.2015.2468576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194748","Node misbehavior;energy efficiency;node misbehavior;trust;wireless sensor networks","Ad hoc networks;Energy consumption;Estimation;Routing;Routing protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","cryptographic protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","TERP;address node misbehaviour attack;composite routing function;control overhead;counter node misbehavior attack;distributed trust model;energy consumption;faulty node detection;faulty node isolation;misbehaving node detection;multifacet routing strategy;neighbour node hopcount;network congestion;network lifetime;network wide dissemination;residual energy;throughput improvement;trust and energy aware routing protocol;trust estimation;wireless sensor network","","0","","23","","2015-08-13","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches meet all of these requirements. Our store-through does this by forwarding each out-of-order or IP-fragmented packet immediately after copying it even if it has not been checked yet. Although the forwarded packet might turn out to be a part of an attack, the store-through can successfully defend against the attack by blocking one of the subsequent packets.

An information-theoretic framework is presented, to quantitatively measure trust and build a novel trust model (FAPtrust) with multiple trust decision factors. These decision factors are incorporated to reflect trust relationship's complexity and uncertainty in various angles. The weight of these factors is set up using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory based on entropy weight method, which makes the model has a better rationality. Moreover, the fuzzy logic rules prediction mechanism is adopted to update a node's trust for future decision-making. As an application of this model, a novel reactive trust-based multicast routing protocol is proposed. This new trusted protocol provides a flexible and feasible approach in routing decision-making, taking into account both the trust constraint and the malicious node detection in multi-agent systems. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the efficiency of trust model and multicast trust enhancement in the improvement of network interaction quality, trust dynamic adaptability, malicious node identification, attack resistance and enhancements of system's security.","1751-8709","","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748543","","","analytic hierarchy process;decision making;fuzzy set theory;mobile ad hoc networks;multi-agent systems;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication security","FAPtrust;decision-making;entropy weight method;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process theory;fuzzy logic;fuzzy theory;information-theoretic framework;malicious node detection;mobile ad hoc network security;multi-agent system;multiple trust decision factor;network interaction quality;network trust dynamic adaptability;trust model;trust-based multicast routing protocol","","0","","","","","March 2014","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The objective of this paper is to incorporate several enhancements starting with feature selection and then applying Fuzzy Logic to enhance Genetic Algorithm (GA). Selection network features has a great importance to increase detection rate, which is itself a problem in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Since elimination of the insignificant and/or useless features leads to a simplified problem and enhance detection rate. By combining different selected features that will be evaluated, where this will lead us to determine suitable combination features to attain best results. In ESSGBML, Zeroth Level Classifier System (ZCS) plays the role of detector by matching incoming environment message with classifiers to determine whether it is normal or intrusion. For GA, the probability of crossover will be enhanced by applying fuzzy logic.

In order to solve such security issues, we purpose a NIDS architecture which addresses the same constraints as a cluster: efficiency, scalability and reliability. It is based on the cluster paradigm.

We begin by describing a methodology for benign traffic generation that combines payload pools (possibly culled from traces of live traffic) with application-specific automata to generate streams with representative characteristics. Next, we describe a methodology for malicious traffic generation, and techniques for integration with benign traffic to produce a range of realistic workload compositions. We realize our traffic generation framework in a tool we call Trident, and demonstrate its utility through a series of laboratory-based experiments using traces collected from our departmental border router, the DARPA intrusion detection evaluation data sets provided by Lincoln Lab, and a suite of malicious traffic modules that reproduce a broad range of attacks commonly seen in today's networks.

However, less success has been encountered in mapping data intensive irregular applications such as graph analytics, relational databases, and machine learning. Recently introduced nested device-side kernel launching functionality in the GPU is a step in the right direction, but still falls short of being able to effectively harness the GPUs performance potential. We propose a new mechanism called Dynamic Thread Block Launch (DTBL) to extend the current bulk synchronous parallel model underlying the current GPU execution model by supporting dynamic spawning of lightweight thread blocks. This mechanism supports the nested launching of thread blocks rather than kernels to execute dynamically occurring parallel work elements. This paper describes the execution model of DTBL, device-runtime support, and microarchitecture extensions to track and execute dynamically spawned thread blocks. Experiments with a set of irregular data intensive CUDA applications executing on a cycle-level simulator show that DTBL achieves average 1.21x speedup over the original flat implementation and average 1.40x over the implementation with device-side kernel launches using CUDA Dynamic Parallelism.","","","","10.1145/2749469.2750393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284092","","Cognition;Context;Graphics processing units;Instruction sets;Kernel;Organizations;Registers","graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel programming","1D-3D grid;BSP programming languages;CUDA dynamic parallelism;DTBL;GPU execution model;bulk synchronous parallel programming languages;cycle-level simulator;data intensive irregular applications;dynamic thread block launch;irregular data intensive CUDA applications;lightweight execution mechanism;lightweight thread block dynamic spawning;nested device-side kernel launching functionality","","","","","","","13-17 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, offloaded IDSes cannot continue to monitor their target VM when the VM is migrated to another host. In this paper, we propose VMCoupler for enabling co-migration of offloaded IDSes and their target VM. Our approach is running offloaded IDSes in a special VM called a guard VM, which can monitor the internals of the target VM using VM introspection. VMCoupler can migrate a guard VM together with its target VM and restore the state of VM introspection at the destination. The migration processes of these two VMs are synchronized so that the target VM does not run without being monitored. We have confirmed that the overheads of kernel monitoring and co-migration were small.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2013.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753786","IaaS clouds;intrusion detection systems;migration;virtual machines","Bridges;Linux;Monitoring;Network interfaces;Ports (Computers);Switches;Synchronization","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","IDS offloading;IDSes;IaaS clouds;VM introspection;VMCoupler;guard VM;infrastructure-as-a-service;intrusion detection system;kernel monitoring;synchronized comigration;virtual machine","","2","","19","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ANCS 2006. ACM/IEEE Symposium on","20080725","2006","","","81","92","Modern deep packet inspection systems use regular expressions to define various patterns of interest in network data streams. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) are commonly used to parse regular expressions. DFAs are fast, but can require prohibitively large amounts of memory for patterns arising in network applications. Traditional DFA table compression only slightly reduces the memory required and requires an additional memory access per input character. Alternative representations of regular expressions, such as NFAs and delayed input DFAs (D<sup>2</sup>FA) require less memory but sacrifice throughput. In this paper we introduce the content addressed delayed input DFA (CD<sup>2</sup>FA), which provides a compact representation of regular expressions that match the throughput of traditional uncompressed DFAs. A CD<sup>2</sup>FA addresses successive states of a D2FA using their content, rather than a ""content-less"" identifier. This makes selected information available earlier in the state traversal process, which makes it possible to avoid unnecessary memory accesses. We demonstrate that such content-addressing can be effectively used to obtain automata that are very compact and can achieve high throughput. Specifically, we show that for an application using thousands of patterns defined by regular expressions, CD<sup>2</sup>FAs use as little as 10% of the space required by a conventional compressed DFA, and match the throughput of an uncompressed DFA.","","978-1-59593-580-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579526","DFA;deep packet inspection;regular expressions","Added delay;Automata;Computer security;Doped fiber amplifiers;Information security;Inspection;Operating systems;Pattern matching;Permission;Throughput","computer networks;data compression;deterministic automata;finite automata;grammars;storage management","content addressed delayed input;content addressing;deep packet inspection;deterministic finite automata;expression representation;memory access;network applications;network data streams;regular expression parsing;state traversal process;table compression","","15","2","34","","","3-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to cryptography based protective techniques such as authentication and authorization, several defense measures, like Intrusion Detection and Tolerance, and tools are employed to protect networks thereby, making security a critical issue. Therefore, the need for defining, structuring, and quantifying security arises as a necessary first step towards measuring the effectiveness of security related deployments. This work proposes a structured approach to define and analyze security related metrics for intrusion tolerant systems for each individual host in the network and compose them in a meaningful way to provide an overall security quantification for a network. The dynamics of each machine against a particular vulnerability is modeled as a (hidden) Markov process to capture uncertainties in attacker's action and system response. Based on these stochastic analysis, security metrics of each machine are calculated which are subsequently used in the final computation of the security metrics of the network.","","978-1-4244-5487-7","","10.1109/COMSNETS.2010.5431978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431978","Markov process;Network security;hidded Markov model;intrusion detection system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probabilities;vulnerabilities","Application software;Authentication;Authorization;Computer networks;Cryptography;Hidden Markov models;Intrusion detection;Markov processes;Protection;Uncertainty","authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;hidden Markov models;message authentication;probability;stochastic processes","computer network;cryptography based protective technique;hidden Markov process;intrusion detection;intrusion tolerant system;security metrics;security quantification;steady-state probability;stochastic analysis","","1","","15","","","5-9 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the most important components of a network management system to prevent attacks from paralysing the entire network.

This study presents an incremental network traffic classification algorithm called incremental particle swarm optimisation to enhance the performance of IDS. Based on semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation, the proposed algorithm is composed of two major phases: (i) the classification phase is employed to create the classifier for differentiating the type of network flows from the training dataset and (ii) the clustering phase is then used to classify the newly incoming patterns, which may contain known and unknown network flow types.","2047-4954","","","10.1049/iet-net.2012.0209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584858","","","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","IDS;classification phase;clustering phase;efficient network management method;high-quality network services;incremental network traffic classification algorithm;incremental particle swarm optimisation;intrusion detection system;network management system;semi-supervised particle swarm optimisation","","0","","","","","Sept. 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.","","","","10.1109/SRDS.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6983400","Byzantine fault tolerance;attacks;distributed systems;failure detector;intrusion detection;state machine replication","Computer crashes;Detectors;Fault tolerance;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols","cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;protocols;security of data;system recovery","ByzID;Byzantine fault masking;Byzantine fault tolerance;Paxos;cloud computing infrastructures;crash-resilient protocols;distributed systems;failure types;intrusion detection;replicated state machines;robust network services","","0","","40","","","6-9 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is an unsatisfactory level of protection against abuse of cloud offerings at the moment. In this paper, we analyse the current state of abuse detection and prevention in IaaS cloud computing. To establish what constitutes abuse in an IaaS environment, a survey of acceptable use policies of cloud service providers was conducted. We have found that existing intrusion detection and prevention techniques are only of limited use in this environment due to the high level of control that users can exercise over their resources. However, cloud computing opens up different opportunities for intrusion detection.

This knowledge is provided by network mapping tools. These tools rely on models to represent the entities of interest, and they leverage off network discovery techniques to populate the model structure with the data that is pertinent to a specific target network. Unfortunately, existing tools rely on incomplete data models. Networks are complex systems and most approaches oversimplify their target models in an effort to limit the problem space. In addition, the techniques used to populate the models are limited in scope and are difficult to extend. This paper presents NetMap, a security tool for network modeling, discovery, and analysis. NetMap relies on a comprehensive network model that is not limited to a specific network level; it integrates network information throughout the layers. The model contains information about topology, infrastructure, and deployed services. In addition, the relationships among different entities in different layers of the model are made explicit. The modeled information is managed by using a suite of composable network tools that can determine various aspects of network configurations through scanning techniques and heuristics.

In this paper we propose a lightweight protocol called DICAS that mitigates these attacks by detecting, diagnosing, and isolating the malicious nodes. DICAS uses as a fundamental building block the ability of a node to oversee its neighboring nodes communication. On top of DICAS, we build a secure routing protocol, LSR, which in addition supports multiple node-disjoint paths. We analyze the security guarantees of DICAS and use ns-2 simulations to show its effectiveness against three representative attacks.

In this paper we propose solutions using an unobtrusive monitoring technique using the ""detection manager"" to locate malicious or faulty nodes that misroute, corrupt or drop packets. The unobtrusive monitoring technique is similar to an intrusion detection system that monitors system activity logs to determine if the system is under attack. This technique uses information from different network layers to detect malicious nodes. The detection manager we are developing for mobile ad-hoc networks stores several rules for responding to different situations. Any single node in the network can use unobtrusive monitoring without relying on the cooperation of other nodes, which makes unobtrusive monitoring easy to implement and deploy. Simulations of mobile ad-hoc networks that contain malicious nodes indicate that unobtrusive monitoring has a high detection effectiveness with low false positive rate.","","0-7803-8104-1","","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292276","","Ad hoc networks;Computer security;Fault detection;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Monitoring;Protection;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","detection manager;malicious nodes;mobile ad-hoc networks;security attacks;unobtrusive monitoring technique","","3","1","18","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After investigation on most of the existing alert fusion systems, we found the current body of work alternatively weighed down in the mire of insecure design or rarely deployed because of their complexity. As confirmed by our experimental analysis, unsuitable mechanisms could easily be submerged by an abundance of useless alerts. Even with the use of methods that achieve a high fusion rate and low false positives, attack is also possible. To find the solution, we carried out analysis on a series of alerts generated by well-known datasets as well as realistic alerts from the Australian Honey-Pot. One important finding is that one alert has more than an 85% chance of being fused in the following 5 alerts. Of particular importance is our design of a novel lightweight Cache-based Alert Fusion Scheme, called CAFS. CAFS has the capacity to not only reduce the quantity of useless alerts generated by IDS (Intrusion Detection System), but also enhance the accuracy of alerts, therefore greatly reducing the cost of fusion processing. We also present reasonable and practical specifications for the target-oriented fusion policy that provides a quality guarantee on alert fusion, and as a result seamlessly satisfies the process of successive correlation. Our experimental results showed that the CAFS easily attained the desired level of survivable, inescapable alert fusion design. Furthermore, as a lightweight scheme, CAFS can easily be deployed and excel in a large amount of alert fusions, which go towards improving the usability of system resources. To the best of our knowledge, our work is a novel exploration in addressing these problems from a survivable, inescapable and deployable point of view.","","978-1-4244-8335-8","978-0-7695-4214-0","10.1109/HPCC.2010.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587281","Alert fusion;Cache-based mechanism;Target oriented policy","","security of data;sensor fusion","Australian Honey-Pot;CAFS scheme;alert fusion mechanism;cache-based alert fusion scheme;intrusion alert fusion system;intrusion detection system","","4","","28","","","1-3 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hardware solutions are available and result in much higher efficiency but present problems such as flexibility and cost. Our proposed system uses a modified version of Snort, a robust widely deployed open-sourced NIDS. It has been found that Snort spends at least 30%-60% of its processing time doing pattern matching. Our proposed system runs Snort in software until it gets to the pattern matching function and then offloads that processing to the field programmable gate array (FPGA). The software can then go on to other processing while it waits for the results from the FPGA. The hardware is able to process data at upto 1.7 GB/s on one Xilinx XC2VP100 FPGA.

It is a hard issue since the streaming data have some tough characteristics, such as unknown or unbound size, possibly a variable arrival rate, lack of ability to backtrack over previously arrived transactions, and a lack of system control over the order in which the data arrive. This paper will find a network model which is more suitable for high speed processing of massive data streams in real-time from various data sources by considering the frequency property of events. An Intrusion prevention system have been built with online mining of frequent item sets over a stream with Time-sensitive sliding window, which is one of the most important technique in stream data mining with broad applications. This approach will be used to set the rules for Backtracking to determine the intrusion characteristics then to implement the “ Deny All except allowed” policy rules for prevention. Combination of stream processing and backtracking is used to achieve this so-called Intrusion Prevention, so that in addition to detecting the existence of intrusion we do deny of intrusion as prevention.","","978-1-4577-1545-7","","10.1109/ICDCSyst.2012.6188773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6188773","Data Stream;Frequent pattern mining;Intrusion Prevention","Analytical models;Maintenance engineering;Real time systems","computer network security;data mining","anomaly intrusion prevention system;backtracking rule;contemporary intrusion detection system;data source;high speed processing;intrusion characteristics;massive stream data processing;network model;online frequent item sets mining;prevention policy rule;stream data mining;time-sensitive sliding window;variable arrival rate","","0","","16","","","15-16 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of popularity and ease of use it gained the interest of attackers. Web applications attackers mostly use browsers as an attacking tool. Web applications are prone to all major vulnerabilities as normal software vulnerabilities. Among all, SQL Injections and XSS are most popular and frequently occurred attacks. Existing research works majorly concentrated on code verification with syntax analyzers and are deployed at the server. These techniques overheads the web applications performance because of online verification of SQL statements that are dynamically prepared by the applications and are combined deployed along with the web application at the server. Unfortunately, these techniques are bound to a programming language. Combined approaches such as IPAAS use syntax analyzers as well as HTTP Parameter type verification. Even though the technique overcomes the problem of code modification at client/server, it is also bound to a programming language. We propose a novel technique of HTTP Stateless and automated parameter pollution verification at network level, it is an independent of web application programming language, and can be directly applied on any web application. It doesn't depend on syntax analyzers and is anomaly intrusion detection system, capable of detecting published (known) and un-published (unknown) vulnerabilities. It reduces the sanity checks at web application. The system evaluated on seven SQL/XSS allowed real time web applications with 2783 attack patterns of exploit-db and on all possible parameters.

In this paper we propose two schemes for key management in clustered sensor networks with changing cluster head. In Simple Secure Logical Ring (SSLR) scheme communication and computation cost incurred for key establishment is constant. Whereas in Burmester Desmedt Logical Ring (BDLR) scheme key establishment is achieved by performing (n + 1) multiplications and (n+ 5) communications, where n is the number of nodes in the cluster.

However these techniques are not adequate to counter a large scale distributed denial of service attacks. In this paper, we propose a countermeasure which uses dynamic agents to mitigate denial of service attacks. These dynamics agents are called Gnipper vaccine. Gnipper vaccine provides an effective technique capable of providing an enterprise-wide response.

This paper presents a new approach to detect anomaly behaviors in encrypted accesses with SSH2 protocol to network public servers such as http servers, ftp servers and database servers. In this approach, first the system extracts information from each SSH client, which is consist of transferred data size and time interval between messages. Second, the various actions are identified based on similarity of information. Finally, attacks are detected according to intrusion signatures, generated from the frequency of accesses and specifications of TCP traffic. This system dose not decipher private information, because it detect intrusion only by use of transferred data size and time interval between messages and does not require too many calculations, which are needed in common encrypted traffic analysis methods, before start operation. We show that this system is able to detect various attacks with a high accuracy, by implementing our proposed system on the Snort intrusion detection software and with making use of DARPA evaluation dataset.","","978-1-4244-1691-2","978-1-4244-1692-9","10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4580619","","Access protocols;Computer hacking;Computer networks;Cryptography;Data security;Databases;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Web server","cryptography;feature extraction;network servers;security of data;transport protocols","DARPA evaluation dataset;SSH protocol;Snort intrusion detection software;TCP traffic;database servers;decipher private information;encrypted accesses;encrypted traffic analysis;encryption protocols;http servers, ftp servers;intrusion signatures;network public servers","","3","","18","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this result, we take a novel approach to address the anomalybased intrusion detection. This approach converts all the profiles composing the training database into 2-dimensional geometric points such that these points lie on the the same line y = n-x. A simple comparison operation is sufficient to decide whether an object is normal or anomalous.

To make the hardware filter simple, we use a finite-input memory machine (FIMM). To reduce the memory size of the FIMM, we introduce the parallel sieve method. The proposed method is memorybased, so it is quickly reconfigurable and dissipates lower power than a TCAM-based method. The system is implemented on the Stratix III FPGA with three off-chip SRAMs and an SDRAM, where all ClamAV 514,287 virus patterns are stored.

This paper studies this property by testing 356 severe attacks on the SNIDS Snort, configured with an old official rule set. Of these attacks, 183 attacks are zero-days' to the rule set and 173 attacks are theoretically known to it. The results from the study show that Snort clearly is able to detect zero-days' (a mean of 17% detection). The detection rate is however on overall greater for theoretically known attacks (a mean of 54% detection). The paper then investigates how the zero-days' are detected, how prone the corresponding signatures are to false alarms, and how easily they can be evaded. Analyses of these aspects suggest that a conservative estimate on zero-day detection by Snort is 8.2%.","","","","10.1109/HICSS.2014.600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6759203","Computer security;NIDS;code injection;exploits","Computer architecture;Payloads;Ports (Computers);Reliability;Servers;Software;Testing","computer network security;digital signatures","SNIDS;false alarm;signature based network intrusion detection;zero day attacks;zero day detection","","0","","21","","","6-9 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on","20090605","2009","","","633","638","Deployment of open source software for embedded system is increasing while ubiquitous devices have become widely used. System designer need to cope with malicious input which is made from exposed vulnerability. Lightweight verification and sandbox approach is effective for embedded system,because embedded system is specified, has less generic purpose than PC and servers. In this paper we apply TDE (Trusted Domain Enforcement) for embedded Linux 2.6 series in order to achieve dynamic sandboxing. TDE is a concept showed in TCSEC (Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria) for input validation and sandbox for protecting system. TDE is a kind of extension of TE (Type Enforcement) for dynamic sandboxing although its implementation could be reasonably simple. Our system is based on LIDS (Linux Intrusion System) for Linux 2.4 series. We implement our system as small kernel patch. We also discuss the application of our method for embedded web server. We have coped with thttpd in implementing our TDE system.","","978-1-4244-3569-2","978-0-7695-3575-3","10.1109/CISIS.2009.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066853","Linux 2.6;kernel patch;sandbox;secure embedded system;trusted domain enforcement","Access control;Embedded system;Information security;Java;Kernel;Linux;Open source software;Protection;Tellurium;Web server","Internet;embedded systems;formal verification;public domain software;security of data;ubiquitous computing","dynamic sandboxing;embedded Linux 2.6 series;embedded system;lightweight implementation;lightweight verification;linux intrusion system;open source software;sandbox approach;secure embedded Web server;trusted computer system evaluation criteria;trusted domain enforcement;type enforcement;ubiquitous devices","","0","","23","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Symposium on","20070402","2006","","","1050","1055","The ever-growing complexity of information system demands that the system or its components to be built are self-managing. Self-management connotes that a computing system or its components are able to self-govern with no or very little interventions from the user. In effect, self-management means that it is capable of self-configuration, self-optimization, self-protection, and self-healing. The system being considered in this paper is one which detects the user's context (and if applicable, the user disability as well) and decides the media and modalities that are appropriate for such a context. The paradigm of the system is presented through architectural views. Several tactics to achieve self-management are adapted","","0-7803-9741-X","0-7803-9741-X","10.1109/ISCIT.2006.339938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141377","","Databases;Distributed computing;Employment;Information technology;Laboratories;Machine learning;Mobile computing;Multimedia computing;Noise level;Pervasive computing","multimedia systems;ubiquitous computing","information system;pervasive multimodal multimedia computing system;self-management","","0","","11","","","Oct. 18 2006-Sept. 20 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Lately one of the most hot research topics in network security is intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which try to keep security at the highest level. This paper addresses a IDS using a 2-layered feed-forward neural network. In training phase, “early stopping” strategy is used to overcome the “over-fitting” problem in neural networks. The proposed system is evaluated by DARPA dataset. The connections selected from DARPA is preprocessed and feature range is converted into [-1, 1]. These modifications affect final detection results notably. Experimental results show that the system, with simplicity in comparison with similar cases, has suitable performance with high precision.","","978-0-7695-4042-9","978-1-4244-6962-8","10.1109/ICCNT.2010.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474495","Artificial Neural network;Back propagation;DARPA;Feed-forward;Internet;Intrusion","Artificial neural networks;Computer networks;Data security;Databases;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;IP networks;Information security;Intrusion detection;Neural networks","Internet;computer network security;feedforward neural nets","DARPA dataset;IDS;Internet growth;attack classification;early stopping strategy;feedforward Neural Network;intrusion detection system;network security;overfitting problem","","1","","15","","","23-25 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An entirely new class of emerging network attacks aims at the data plane of the network. Data plane forwarding in network routers has traditionally been implemented with custom-logic hardware, but recent router designs increasingly use software-programmable network processors for packet forwarding. These general-purpose processing devices exhibit software vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. We demonstrate-to our knowledge the first-practical attack that exploits a vulnerability in packet processing software to launch a devastating denial-of-service attack from within the network infrastructure. This attack uses only a single attack packet to consume the full link bandwidth of the router's outgoing link. We also present a hardware-based defense mechanism that can detect situations where malicious packets try to change the operation of the network processor. Using a hardware monitor, our NetFPGA-based prototype system checks every instruction executed by the network processor and can detect deviations from correct processing within four clock cycles. A recovery system can restore the network processor to a safe state within six cycles. This high-speed detection and recovery system can ensure that network processors can be protected effectively and efficiently from this new class of attacks.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2012.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231636","Network security;embedded system security;network attack;network processor;processing monitor;programmable router","Computer crime;Embedded systems;Internet;Network security;Program processors;Routing protocols","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;logic devices","NetFPGA;computer networks;control plane;custom-logic hardware;data plane;denial-of-service attack;hardware-based defense mechanism;network routers;packet forwarding;packet processing software;security issues;software vulnerabilities;software-programmable network processors","","4","","40","","2012-07-03","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In defining and managing trust in a military MANET, we must consider the interactions between the composite cognitive, social, information and communication networks, and take into account the severe resource constraints (e.g., computing power, energy, bandwidth, time), and dynamics (e.g., topology changes, node mobility, node failure, propagation channel conditions). We seek to combine the notions of ""social trust"" derived from social networks with ""quality-of-service (QoS) trust"" derived from information and communication networks to obtain a composite trust metric. We discuss the concepts and properties of trust and derive some unique characteristics of trust in MANETs, drawing upon social notions of trust. We provide a survey of trust management schemes developed for MANETs and discuss generally accepted classifications, potential attacks, performance metrics, and trust metrics in MANETs. Finally, we discuss future research areas on trust management in MANETs based on the concept of social and cognitive networks.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/SURV.2011.092110.00088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5604602","Trust management;cognitive networks;mobile ad hoc networks;social networks;trust;trust metrics","Mobile ad hoc networks;Network security;Reliability;Social network services;Trust management","military communication;mobile ad hoc networks;quality of service;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security","communication network;composite cognitive;composite trust metric;distributed mobile ad hoc network;information network;military MANET;quality-of-service trust;social network;social trust;trust management","","76","1","125","","2010-10-14","Fourth Quarter 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
