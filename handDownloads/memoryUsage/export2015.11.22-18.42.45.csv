Neural networks and Support Vector Machines have been also extensively applied to this task. However, their complexity to learn new attacks has become very expensive, making them inviable for a real time retraining. In this research, we introduce a new pattern classifier named Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) to this task, which has demonstrated to be similar to the state-of-the-art pattern recognition techniques, but extremely more efficient for training patterns. Experiments on public datasets showed that OPF classifier may be a suitable tool to detect intrusions on computer networks, as well as allow the algorithm to learn new attacks faster than the other techniques.","0742-1303","978-1-61284-926-3","","10.1109/LCN.2011.6115182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6115182","","Accuracy;Computer networks;Intrusion detection;Pattern recognition;Prototypes;Training;Vegetation","artificial intelligence;computer network security;neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines","OPF classifier;artificial intelligence;computer networks;intrusion detection system;neural networks;optimum-path forest;pattern classifier;pattern recognition;public datasets;real time retraining;support vector machines;training patterns","","1","","22","","","4-7 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we design an incentive model based on trust management by using game theory for peers to collaborate truthfully without free-riding in an IDN environment. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium under which peers can communicate in an incentive compatible manner. Using duality of the problem, we develop an iterative algorithm that converges geometrically to the equilibrium.

Among many network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), open source systems have gained substantial preference due to their flexibility, support and cost effectiveness. Snort, an open source system is considered as the de-facto standard for NIDS. In this paper, effort has been made to gauge Snort in terms of performance (packet handling) and detection accuracy against TCP Flooding Distributed Denial of Service attack. The evaluation has been done using a sophisticated test-bench under different hardware configurations. This paper has analyzed the major factors affecting the performance and detection capability of Snort and has recommended techniques to make Snort a better intrusion detection system (IDS). Experimental results have shown significant improvement in Snort packet handling capability by using better hardware. However; Snort detection capability is not improved by improving hardware and is dependent upon its internal architecture (signature database and rate filtration). Furthermore, the findings can be applied to other signature based intrusion detection systems for refining their performance and detection capability.","","978-1-4799-1287-2","","10.1109/NCIA.2013.6725321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725321","Distributes Denial of Service;Network Intrusion Detection System;Network Security;Penetration Testing;Snort;Vulnerability Assessment and Defense","Availability;Computer crime;Floods;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Servers","computer network security;public domain software;transport protocols","DDoS attacks;NIDS;Snort detection capability;Snort packet handling capability;TCP flooding distributed denial of service attack;detection accuracy;hardware configurations;internal architecture;network intrusion detection systems;network security;open source systems;rate filtration;signature database","","1","","26","","","11-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cyber-physical contingency ranking technique employed by SOCCA assesses the potential impacts of events. Contingencies are ranked according to their impact as well as attack complexity.

We can immediately protect the system from many variants of previously unknown attacks without debilitating waits for anti-virus updates or software patches. Unique to our approach is the use of diverse process pairs not only for isolation benefits but also for detection. The architecture uses the comparison of outputs from diverse applications to provide a significant and novel intrusion detection capability. With this technique, we gain the benefits of n-version programming without its controversial disadvantages. The isolation of intrusions is mainly achieved with an out-of-band control system that separates the primary and backup system.

In this paper, we present efficient algorithms based on fast Fourier transforms. Let P = {p<sub>1</sub>, . . . , p<sub>k</sub>} be a set of patterns with wildcards where the total length of patterns is |P|, and a text t of length n over alphabet a1 , . . . ,a<sub>σ</sub>. We present two algorithms for this problem where patterns are matched simultaneously. The first algorithm finds the matches of a small set of patterns in the text in O(n log |P| + nk) time. The words used in the algorithm are of size k[2 lg σ] + X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> ⌈Ig |p<sub>i</sub>|⌉ bits. The second one finds the matchings of patterns in the text in time O(n log |P| log σ + nk) by computing the Hamming distance between the patterns and the text. The algorithm uses the words with X<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> ⌈lg |p<sub>i</sub>| bits.

To the best of our knowledge, HiFIND is the first online DoS resilient flow-level intrusion detection system for high-speed networks (approximately 10s of Gigabit/second), even for the worst case trafic of 40-byte-packet streams with each packet forming a flow.","1063-6927","0-7695-2540-7","","10.1109/ICDCS.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1648826","","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Frequency;Hardware;High-speed networks;Intrusion detection;Routing;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical)","","","","9","","17","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research work focuses on two techniques for detecting a DoS attack at a medium access control (MAC) layer. Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.","","978-1-4673-2164-8","","10.1109/HPCC.2012.186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332322","Denial of Service;Neural Network;Security;Support Vector Machine;Wireless Sensor Networks","Artificial neural networks;Computer crime;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;probability;real-time systems;support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DoS attack probability detection;MAC;SVM;WSN;denial of service;machine learning;medium access control;neural network;real-time system monitoring;security enhancement;security flaw;support vector machine;wireless sensor network","","1","","14","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security remains a major challenge for these networks due their features of open medium, dynamically changing topologies, reliance on co-operative algorithms, absence of centralized monitoring points, and lack of clear lines of defense. In this paper, we present a cooperative, distributed intrusion detection architecture based on clustering of the nodes that addresses the security vulnerabilities of the network and facilitates accurate detection of attacks. The architecture is organized as a dynamic hierarchy in which the intrusion data is acquired by the nodes and is incrementally aggregated, reduced in volume and analyzed as it flows upwards to the cluster-head. The cluster-heads of adjacent clusters communicate with each other in case of cooperative intrusion detection. For intrusion related message communication, mobile agents are used for their efficiency in lightweight computation and suitability in cooperative intrusion detection.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calculation of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer according to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents compromised guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM. The evaluation shows our approach effectively protects a smart phone against excessive I/O attacks and guarantees availability.","0738-100X","978-1-4244-6677-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5522352","I/O access control;Virtual machine;smart phone security;virtual machine monitor","Access control;Batteries;Degradation;Equations;Kernel;Linux;Prototypes;Secure storage;Security;Smart phones","","","","0","","23","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, during an offline phase, a state-based model of the network is generated, and security-level of each state is measured using a generic and easy-to-compute metric. EliMet then passively observes system operators' online reactive behavior against security incidents, and accordingly refines the calculated security measure values. Finally, to make the values comply with the expert knowledge, EliMet actively queries operators regarding those states for which sufficient information was not gained during the passive observation. Our experimental results show that EliMet can optimally make use of prior knowledge as well as automated inference techniques to minimize human involvement and efficiently deduce the expert knowledge regarding individual states of that particular system.","1530-0889","978-1-4673-1624-8","978-1-4673-1623-1","10.1109/DSN.2012.6263941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263941","Power grid critical infrastructure;intrusion detection and response;security metric;situational awareness","Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring;Particle measurements;Security","control engineering computing;inference mechanisms;power engineering computing;power grids;power system control;power system protection;power system security","EliMet;automated inference techniques;bulk electricity delivery system;complex power-grid control network protection;power grid critical infrastructures;security assessment techniques;security incidents;security measures;security metric elicitation","","4","","42","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, existing honeypots concentrate on malware that spreads over networks, thus missing any malware that does not use a network for propagation. A popular network-independent technique for malware to spread is copying itself to USB flash drives. In this article we present Ghost, a new kind of honeypot for such USB malware. It detects malware by simulating a removable device in software, thereby tricking malware into copying itself to the virtual device.

Intrusive model is used in signature-based NIDS by defining attack patterns and applying signature-matching on incoming traffic packets. Thousands of signatures and rules are created to specify different attacks and variations of a single attack. As a result, enormous data with less efficiency is produced that overwhelms the network administrator. Most of the generated alerts are false-positives; this is due to the redundancy caused by the detection techniques, and due to low-level processing capacity. Moreover, detection of novel and multi-stage attacks are not efficiently achieved by the current systems. Hence, high-level view of the attacker's behaviour has become a stressing demand. Alerts correlation techniques have been widely used to provide intelligent and stateful detection methodologies. This is to understand attack steps and predict the expected sequence of events. However, most of the proposed systems are based on rules libraries specified by security experts, which is a cumbersome and error prone task. Other methods are based on statistical models; these are unable to identify causal relationships between the events. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the current techniques and propose a framework for alert correlation that overcomes these shortcomings. An improved “cause and effect” model will be presented cooperating with statistical model to achieve higher detection rate with minimum false positives. Knowledge-based model with vulnerability and extensional consequences parameters has been developed to provide manageable and meaningful graph. The proposed system is evaluated using DARPA 2000 and collected real life data sets. The results have shown an improvement in respect to detection rate and reduction of false positives.","1550-445X","978-1-4244-6695-5","","10.1109/AINA.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474796","Alerts correlation;Network intrusion detection systems;multi-stage attack","Data mining;Data security;Informatics;Intrusion detection;Knowledge management;Libraries;Mars;Redundancy;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","security of data","DARPA 2000;alerts correlation techniques;attack patterns;detection techniques;extensional consequences parameters;knowledge-based model;low-level processing capacity;multistage attack recognition system;network intrusion detection systems;signature-based NIDS;signature-matching","","3","","22","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets.

It applies some special routing protocols, e.g. Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol, having the ability to forward the packets in dynamic network topology. The existing routing protocols can be divided into unsecure and secure protocols. They could not address all possible attacks aiming the disruption of the protocol itself. This paper addresses the flooding attack by applying multiple nodes in a simulated environment. We propose a Real-time Host Intrusion Detection for Ad hoc Networks (REHIDAN) algorithm to identify the flooding attacker nodes. It also takes the appropriate countermeasures to minimize the effectiveness of the attack and maintain the network performance within the accepted limits. The ad hoc network is simulated using the Optimized Network Engineering Tools (OPNET). Its performance under the flooding attack and after applying the proposed REHIDAN algorithm is tested. The results show that the proposed REHIDAN algorithm reduces the effect of the attack by reducing the end-to-end delay and the routing overhead ratio.","","978-1-4244-4704-6","978-1-4244-3474-9","10.1109/WOCN.2009.5010583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5010583","","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Delay effects;Floods;Intrusion detection;Maintenance engineering;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols;Testing","mobile radio;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security","dynamic network topology;flooding attack;on-demand distance vector routing protocol;real-time host intrusion detection;wireless ad-hoc networks","","2","","15","","","28-30 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on previous execution statistics, we adjust the transaction execution strategy by decreasing the level of optimism as the deadlines near through two modes of conservative execution, without overly limiting the progress of concurrent transactions. Our implementation comprises a STM extension for gathering statistics and implementing the execution mode strategies. We have also extended the Linux scheduler to disable preemption or migration of threads that are executing transactions with deadlines.

Security of the data is the major concern in cloud from outsiders as well as insiders. Insider attack is the most devastating threat due to the familiarity of the underlying system to the insiders.

Our approach first extracts behavioral features to train classifiers using data mining techniques that can distinguish malicious and benign executables, and then host level agents are introduced to block the execution of malware instances with their content-based fingerprints. To increase accuracy, an algorithm is proposed that applies a classifier to raw audit data as well as observes the executions of malware in virtualized environments.

Security services are usually provided by implementing new security mechanisms that are explicitly tailored to mobile components. Unfortunately, developing sound, reliable security mechanisms is a non-trivial task, and a history of vulnerable and/or incomplete implementations of these mechanisms led to the idea that mobile code systems are inherently insecure, too complex, and very difficult to deploy. To overcome these problems, we developed a mobile code system that relies as much as possible on the security mechanisms already provided by the underlying operating system. By doing this, it is possible to develop, with reduced effort, security services that rely on well-known, well-understood, and well-tested security mechanisms. Also, by describing the security of the mobile code system in terms of the OS security mechanisms, system administrators can better evaluate the security implications of deploying the system.

While the corresponding deterministic finite state automata (DFA) for any one RE is typically small, the DFA that corresponds to the entire set of REs is usually too large to be constructed or deployed. To address this issue, a variety of alternative automata implementations that compress the size of the final automaton have been proposed such as extended finite automata (XFA) and delayed input DFA (D <sup>2</sup>FA). The resulting final automata are typically much smaller than the corresponding DFA. However, the previously proposed automata construction algorithms do suffer from some drawbacks. First, most employ a “Union then Minimize” framework where the automata for each RE are first joined before minimization occurs. This leads to an expensive nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) to DFA subset construction on a relatively large NFA. Second, most construct the corresponding large DFA as an intermediate step. In some cases, this DFA is so large that the final automaton cannot be constructed even though the final automaton is small enough to be deployed. In this paper, we propose a “Minimize then Union” framework for constructing compact alternative automata focusing on the D <sup>2</sup>FA. We show that we can construct an almost optimal final D <sup>2</sup>FA with small intermediate parsers.

In a datacenter network, packet classification plays an important role in supporting various network services. Previous algorithms store classification rules with the same length combinations in a hash table to simplify the search procedure. The search performance of hash-based algorithms is tied to the number of hash tables. To achieve fast and scalable packet classification, we propose an algorithm, encoded rule expansion, to transform rules into an equivalent set of rules with fewer distinct length combinations, without affecting the classification results. The new algorithm can minimize the storage penalty of transformation and achieve a short search time. In addition, the scheme supports fast incremental updates. Our simulation results show that more than 90% hash tables can be eliminated. The reduction of length combinations leads to an improvement on speed performance of packet classification by an order of magnitude. The results also show that the software implementation of our scheme without using any hardware parallelism can support up to one thousand customer VLANs and one million rules, where each rule consumes less than 60 bytes and each packet classification can be accomplished under 50 memory accesses.","0733-8716","","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.140112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689489","Packet classification;VLANs;datacenter network;firewalls;packet forwarding;router architectures;scalability","Data structures;Decision trees;Encoding;Hardware;IP networks;Indexes;Software","computer centres;firewalls;local area networks;telecommunication network routing;virtual machines","VLAN;classification rules;datacenter networks;encoded rule expansion;hardware parallelism;hash table;length combinations;packet classification;packet forwarding;storage penalty","","1","","48","","","January 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This IDS can correlate the information received from the local systems, as well as monitoring data from the Grid System, using statistical methods, to identify attacks that cannot be detected at a local level.

Some researchers suggested to have a central controller which has a global view about the environment to allocate tasks. Although centralized control brings convenience during task allocation processes, it also has some obvious weaknesses. Firstly, a central controller plays an important role in a multi-agent system, but task allocation procedures will break down if the central controller of a system cannot work properly. Secondly, centralized multi-agent architecture is not suitable for distributed working environments. In order to overcome some limitations caused by centralized control, some researchers proposed distributed task allocation protocols. They supposed that each agent has a limited local view about its direct linked neighbors, and can allocate tasks to its neighbors. However, only involving direct linked neighbors could limit resource origins, so that the task allocation efficiency will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an efficient task allocation protocol for P2P multi-agent systems. This protocol allows not only neighboring agents but also indirect linked agents in the system to help with a task if needed. Through this way, agents can achieve more efficient and robust task allocations in loosely coupled distributed environments (e.g. P2P multi-agent systems). A set of experiments are presented in this paper to evaluate the efficiency and adaptability of the protocol. The experiment result shows that the protocol can work efficiently in different situations.","","978-0-7695-3747-4","","10.1109/ISPA.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207966","","Application software;Centralized control;Communication system control;Control systems;Distributed processing;Information systems;Multiagent systems;Protocols;Resource management;Robustness","multi-agent systems;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","P2P multiagent systems;centralized control;centralized multiagent architecture;direct linked neighbors;distributed task allocation protocol;distributed working environment;loosely coupled distributed environment","","2","","16","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which recognizes a set of regular expressions, is the basic data structure to scan input traffic byte by byte. Though DFA meets the requirement of real-time processing of network traffic, constructing a combined DFA for a set of regular expression signatures is very time-consuming, especially when the signature set is large. To attack this problem, we propose new strategies to accelerate DFA construction. The basic idea of our method is to construct the combined DFA by hierarchical merging of the DFAs of each single regular expression. Our method runs in O(|Q||Σ| In n) time, which is substantially superior to the time complexity O(|Q||Σ|(Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>|Qi|)<sup>2</sup>) of classical subset construction algorithm.

It is verified that denial-of-service and probing attacks leave traces on simple network activity models, with rates of false alarm which are comparable to the false alarm rates obtained by the participants of the 1998 DARPA evaluation, in which much more complex detection schemes were utilized.

However, the execution of both techniques at each node generates high overhead and energy consumption, even if we consider a cluster-based WSN. To economize nodes' energy, the cryptography operation is launched during a certain period determined mathematically and only within the cluster where a malicious node is detected.

Artificial immune systems, which is a sub field of artificial intelligence, comprises systems modeled by simplifying models from the biological immune system. If agent-based modeling and simulation is used as a laboratory for understanding the biological immune system then, it can also be used for transferring the observed principles into artificial immune system models or for evaluating models that have been already adapted for solving technical problems. This paper presents first, a methodology for transferring principles of the biological immune system into the field of artificial immune systems. Then, it presents a brief explanation of the behavior of the cells of the biological immune system, which are treated as internal agents inside a biological organism. Afterwards, the modeling of some selected type of cells and the simulation of the whole simplified system are presented. In the end, the principles of that simplified system are transferred into the design of an alarm management system for the smart grid.","","978-1-4673-0900-4","","10.1109/ISORCW.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6196124","agent-based modeling;agent-based modeling and simulation;agent-based simulation;artificial immune systems;emergence;intelligent agents;security;smart grid","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Immune system;Object oriented modeling;Pathogens","artificial immune systems;cellular biophysics;multi-agent systems","agent-based modeling;agent-based simulation;alarm management system design;artificial immune systems;artificial intelligence;autonomous agents;biological immune system models;biological organism;cell behavior simulation;population-based systems;smart grid","","3","","9","","","11-11 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Models of normal behavior can represent either the set of allowed patterns (positive detection) or the set of anomalous patterns (negative detection). A formal framework is given for analyzing the tradeoffs between positive and negative detection schemes in terms of the number of detectors needed to maximize coverage. For realistically sized problems, the universe of possible patterns is too large to represent exactly (in either the positive or negative scheme). Partial matching rules generalize the set of allowable (or unallowable) patterns, and the choice of matching rule affects the tradeoff between positive and negative detection. A new match rule is introduced, called r-chunks, and the generalizations induced by different partial matching rules are characterized in terms of the crossover closure. Permutations of the representation can be used to achieve more precise discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns.

With the rapid popularization of multi-core system, it is a good choice to apply NIDS in CMP architecture to achieve higher performance. Some companies have taken the first step. Their scheduling algorithm operates at a custom NIC based on FPGA technology. LLF algorithm can't be used in such environment because it needs much more memory than NIC owns. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme that re-maps the new arrival flows when the system is unbalanced.

In a smart home scenario, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) can potentially provide information about device activities and their status. This information can be useful for variety of purposes like monitoring home security, examining status of nodes, and replacing nodes that are malfunctioning or dead. The sensor network needs to be protected from intrusions and anomalies. Over the years, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are proposed for preventing WSNs from intrusions. Although some mobile agent based IDS are proposed, anomaly detection for wireless smart home sensor network (WSHSN) is not fully exploited. In this article, we have proposed a mobile agent based anomaly detection mechanism for WSHSNs. The proposed scheme takes advantage from heterogeneous nature of devices in smart home for effectively detecting anomalies. The anomaly detection infrastructure is installed at resource rich nodes such as Cluster Heads (CHs).The mobile agent takes only few bytes of data to further assess the anomalous behavior of suspicious node. The analysis and comparative study show several advantages of the proposed scheme, such as efficient utilization of memory, reducing network load, and reduction in overall computational cost of the network. The nature of our proposed solution is generic, so that as it is, or with slight modifications, it can be implemented on other heterogeneous wireless sensor networks.","","978-1-4673-3084-8","","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2012.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6332015","anomaly detection;intrusion detection system;mobile Agent;pervasive computing;wireless smart home sensor network","","home computing;mobile agents;security of data;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","CH;IDS;WSHSN;WSN;cluster heads;device activities;home security;intrusion detection systems;memory utilization;mobile agent based anomaly detection;network load reduction;node replacement;node status examination;overall computational cost reduction;pervasive computing applications;suspicious node anomalous behavior;wireless smart home sensor networks","","3","","23","","","4-7 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Android devices have gained huge market share due to the open architecture of Android and the popularity of its application programming interface (APIs) in the developer community. Increased popularity of the Android devices and associated monetary benefits attracted the malware developers, resulting in big rise of the Android malware apps between 2010 and 2014. Academic researchers and commercial antimalware companies have realized that the conventional signature-based and static analysis methods are vulnerable. In particular, the prevalent stealth techniques, such as encryption, code transformation, and environment-aware approaches, are capable of generating variants of known malware. This has led to the use of behavior-, anomaly-, and dynamic-analysis-based methods. Since a single approach may be ineffective against the advanced techniques, multiple complementary approaches can be used in tandem for effective malware detection. The existing reviews extensively cover the smartphone OS security. However, we believe that the security of Android, with particular focus on malware growth, study of antianalysis techniques, and existing detection methodologies, needs an extensive coverage. In this survey, we discuss the Android security enforcement mechanisms, threats to the existing security enforcements and related issues, malware growth timeline between 2010 and 2014, and stealth techniques employed by the malware authors, in addition to the existing detection methods. This review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known research methodologies and provides a platform, to the researchers and practitioners, toward proposing the next-generation Android security, analysis, and malware detection techniques.","1553-877X","","","10.1109/COMST.2014.2386139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999911","Android Malware;Android malware;Behavioral Analysis;Dynamic Analysis;Obfuscation;Static Analysis;Stealth Malwar;behavioral analysis;dynamic analysis;obfuscation;static analysis;stealth malware","Androids;Google;Humanoid robots;Malware;Smart phones;Tutorials","Android (operating system);application program interfaces;invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;smart phones","API;Android device;Android malware application;Internet;SMS;application programming interface;dynamic-analysis-based method;location-based service;malware detection techniques;malware penetration;multimedia services;next-generation Android security enforcement mechanism;office application;prevalent stealth techniques;signature-based analysis method;smartphone OS security;static analysis method;static analysis methods;vehicle guidance;voice call","","0","","143","","2014-12-30","Secondquarter 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Instead, we address another issue: the scalability of DFAs to parallel systems and their buffer requirements. To our knowledge, a single attempt to parallelize DFA walk on regular multicore systems (which ex- ploits speculation with limited efficiency) has been proposed in literature. We propose a solution in which a number of processing units are committed to walk in parallel a DFA for the same packet; at this aim, sampling techniques on both text and regular expressions are adopted. This scheme is the first in literature that proposes effective parallelization of DFA walk, hence allowing for packet processing time reduction and less memory for reordering buffers.

With fast-growing rule sets, implementing AC automaton with a small memory without sacrificing its performance has remained challenging in NIDS design. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm named P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing, which allows transitions of an AC automaton to be placed in a compact hash table without any collision. P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing is based on the observation that a hash key of each transition consists of two dimensions, namely a source state ID and an input character. When placing a transition in a hash table and causing a collision, we can change the value of a dimension of the hash key to rehash the transition to a new location of the hash table. For a given AC automaton, P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing first divides all the transitions into many small sets based on the two-dimensional values of the hash keys, and then places the sets of transitions progressively into the hash table until all are placed. Hash collisions that occurred during the insertion of a transition will only affect the transitions in the same set. The proposed P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing has many unique properties, including fast hash index generation and zero memory overhead, which are very suitable for the AC automaton operation. The feasibility and performance of P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing are investigated through simulations on the full Snort (6.4k rules) and Clam AV (54k rules) rule sets, each of which is first converted to a single AC automaton. Simulation results show that P<sup>2</sup>-Hashing can successfully construct the perfect hash table even when the load factor of the hash table is as high as 0.91.","","978-1-4577-1454-2","978-0-7695-4521-9","10.1109/ANCS.2011.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062729","Aho-Corasick Automaton;Hash Collision;Multi-string Matching;Perfect Hash Table","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Bipartite graph;Indexes;Memory management;Security;Throughput","automata theory;computer network security;file organisation;set theory;string matching","Aho-Corasick automaton;NIDS design;P<sup>2</sup>-hashing algorithm;fast hash index generation;hash table;high-speed string matching;multidimensional progressive perfect hashing algorithm;network intrusion detection system;rule sets;source state ID;zero memory overhead","","1","","27","","","3-4 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces a dynamically updating key distribution strategy to enhance mesh network security against cyber attack. The scheme has been applied to two security protocols known as simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) and efficient mesh security association (EMSA). Since both protocols utilize 4-way handshaking, we propose a Merkle-tree based handshaking scheme, which is capable of improving the resiliency of the network in a situation where an intruder carries a denial of service attack. Finally, by developing a denial of service attack model, we can then evaluate the security of the proposed schemes against cyber attack, as well as network performance in terms of delay and overhead.","1949-3053","","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2277963","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599007","EMSA;IEEE 802.11s;SAE;security attacks;security protocols;smart grid;wireless mesh networks","Authentication;Computer crime;Logic gates;Mesh networks;Protocols;Smart grids","computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;home networks;smart power grids;substations;trees (mathematics);wireless LAN;wireless mesh networks;wireless sensor networks","EMSA;HAN;IEEE 802.11s;Merkle tree 4-way handshaking scheme;NAN;SAE;WLAN;cost-ef- fective communications;cyber attack;denial-of-service attack model;distributed mesh sensor networks;dynamic key distribution strategy updating;efficient mesh security association;home area networks;neighborhood area networks;network performance;network resiliency improvement;plant-generation local area networks;security protocols;simultaneous authentication-of-equals;smart grid mesh network security enhancement;substation local area networks;wireless local area networks","","1","","26","","2013-09-13","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A common countermeasure is to apply misuse detection and prevention systems that compare the contents of HTTP traffic against signatures of known attacks, as it is for example done by web application firewalls. A serious drawback of these systems is the fact that the used signatures often are not tailored for the individual web applications to be protected. Furthermore, signatures can often be circumvented by rewriting attacks into different forms, resulting in successful exploitation and circumvention of a misuse detection or prevention system. This paper presents the design and implementation of an anomaly detection framework for HTTP traffic that operates without signatures of known attacks. It rather learns normal usage patterns of web-based applications by inspecting full HTTP request and response contents. The results are then used for anomaly detection. The framework automatically adjusts to the applications to be monitored, derives normal usage patterns and compares subsequent HTTP traffic to the built knowledge base.","","978-1-4244-6938-3","978-1-4244-6939-0","10.1109/IWSCN.2010.5497997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497997","","Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Information systems;Information technology;Java;Pattern analysis;Protection;Protocols;Testing;Web server","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data","HTTP traffic;Web application firewalls;Web applications;Web-based services;anomaly detection;instance-based learning;k-nearest neighbor classification;misuse detection system;misuse prevention system","","1","","13","","","26-28 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The simplest way to implement such system is using the memory-based deterministic finite automata, but their storage requirement is growing exponentially with the number of patterns. Another issue is the computation time in order to detect the attack in real time. This work has the goal to propose an efficient deep packet inspection (DPI) algorithm and to analyze its efficiently implementation using a specialized hardware circuit and the GPU CUDA (Computer Unified Device Architecture) enabled boards existing in the personal computers. The following tasks have been analyzed: the parallelization of the pattern matching algorithm and the optimization of C code written for Nvidia compiler to obtain the best performance.

For the sake of realizing load balancing among the data analyzing nodes, an integrated scheduling algorithm of the task assignment based on the resource usable degree and credibility degree is used. In order to reduce alarm quantity, an alarm synthetic algorithm based on rules of similar degree and relevance degree is adopted.

If such an attack can be found, it implies that the target detector is vulnerable against mimicry attacks. In this work, we emphasize that there are two components of a buffer overflow attack: the preamble and the exploit. Although the attacker can modify the exploit component easily, the attacker may not be able to prevent preamble from generating anomalous behavior since during preamble stage, the attacker does not have full control. Previous work on mimicry attacks considered an attack to completely evade detection, if the exploit raises no alarms. On the other hand, in this work, we investigate the source of anomalies in both the preamble and the exploit components against two anomaly detectors that monitor four vulnerable UNIX applications. Our experiment results show that preamble can be a source of anomalies, particularly if it is lengthy and anomalous.","","978-0-7695-3390-2","","10.1109/PST.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641288","Information hiding;anomaly detection;mimicry attacks;vulnerability testing","Assembly;Buffer overflow;Computer science;Databases;Detectors;Gain control;Information analysis;Monitoring;Privacy;System testing","object detection;security of data","UNIX applications;anomalous behavior;buffer overflow attack;mimicry attacks;target detector","","2","","18","","","1-3 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Eagle Eyes: Protocol Independent Packet Marking Scheme to Filter Attack Packets and Reduce Collateral Damage During Flooding Based DoS and DDoS Attacks","Saurabh, S.; Sairam, A.S.","Dept. of Comput.

Such rate limiting schemes drop all excess-traffic when the request arrival rate goes above a certain empirically calculated threshold. Flooding based DoS/DDoS attacks like TCP SYN Attack does not exhibit any special signature except that their arrival-rate is high enough to overwhelm the victim. Hence it is very difficult to differentiate between legitimate and attack traffic as they share the same signature. As a result, rate limiting schemes cause heavy collateral damage by dropping out legitimate traffic [15]. In this paper we propose a novel packet marking mechanism which not only mitigates DoS/DDoS attacks by filtering but also reduces collateral damage significantly by selectively dropping attack packets based on its packet mark while allowing the legitimate traffic to be processed smoothly. Our packet mark contains fingerprint of the path in each single packet which allows us in identifying attack packets coming from various sources even in case of IP spoofing. Our scheme does not require any protocol specific knowledge and can generically filter out attack packets for all kinds of flooding attacks. We have extensively evaluated our packet marking scheme. Results show effectiveness of our scheme in filtering attack traffic. Our scheme inflicts extremely low collateral damage to legitimate traffic while quickly detecting and selectively filtering attack traffic.","","978-1-4673-3149-4","","10.1109/ICCCT.2012.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394683","Anomaly Detection;DDoS;TCP SYN Attack;collateral damage;packet marking;selective filtering","Computer crime;IP networks;Internet;Limiting;Routing;Servers;Topology","IP networks;computer network security;protocols;telecommunication traffic","Eagle Eyes;IP spoofing;TCP SYN attack;attack packet filtering;attack traffic filtering;collateral damage reduction;distributed denial of service attacks;dropping attack packets;excess traffic dropping;flooding based DDoS Attacks;protocol independent packet marking scheme;rate limiting schemes","","0","","18","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
