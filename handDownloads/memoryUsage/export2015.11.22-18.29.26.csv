Accordingly, this work presents a new more active and scalable fire walling architecture based on dynamic and adaptive policy management facilities, thus enabling the automatic generation of new rules and policies, to ensure a timely response in detecting unusual traffic activity and identify unknown potential attacks (0day).

This is measured by quantifying areas of analogous information or entropy between incoming network streams and reference malicious samples. Machine learning methods are used to quickly cluster similar groups of streams from the datasets.

Basically, Internet was built with the focus on its functionality and not with the focus on the security tasks. This has led to discovering embedded weaknesses in Internet architecture, which can be misused by attackers with malicious purposes. This paper focuses on application layer Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks detection, because these attacks present a continuous critical threat to the Internet services. DDoS attacks are typically carried out at the network layer. However, there is evidence to suggest that application layer DDoS attacks can be more effective than the traditional ones. Over some period of time, researchers proposed many solutions to prevent the DoS/DDoS attacks from different OSI layers, but there has been done only a very small research on application layer. In this paper, we consider sophisticated attacks that utilize legitimate application layer requests from legitimately connected network machines to overwhelm Web server. Since the attack signature of each application layer DDoS is represented in abnormal user behavior, we propose several mechanisms, which can be used for application DoS/DDoS attack detection.","","978-1-4673-1180-9","","10.1109/ELEKTRO.2012.6225571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225571","Denial of Service;Distributed Denial of Service;application layer","Bandwidth;Computer crime;Computers;IP networks;Monitoring;Web servers","Internet;computer network security","Internet;OSI layer;application service;denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;embedded weaknesses;legitimate application layer","","5","","28","","","21-22 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach scales up the balance detection rates for different types of network intrusions, and keeps the false positives at acceptable level in network intrusion detection. The algorithm first clusters the network logs into several groups based on similarity of network logs, and then calculates the prior and class conditional probabilities for each cluster. In classifying a new network log, the algorithm calculates the similarity of attribute values of network data with each cluster and initialize a weight value for each cluster. Then each cluster classifies the network data with its priori and conditional probabilities that multiply with respective cluster's weight value. Finally, voting techniques applied for classifying the new network data based on each cluster's classification result. The performance of the proposed algorithm tested by employing KDD99 benchmark network intrusion detection dataset, and the experimental results proved that it improves the detection rates as well as reduces the false positives for different types of network intrusions.","","","","10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.6997324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997324","boosting;intrusion detection;naÃ¯ve Bayesian classifier","Bayes methods;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computers;Intrusion detection;Niobium","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","KDD99 dataset;adaptive network intrusion detection;conditional probability;false positive reduction;intrusion detection learning algorithm;naive Bayesian classifier;network logs similarity;network mining;pattern clustering;supervised learning process;unsupervised learning process","","0","","35","","","8-10 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One important specification of such systems is high availability. Recent attacks to ICS illustrate that almost any cyber attack can be orchestrated on these systems. Current security techniques, tools, and methods cannot prevent these cyber attacks. Attacks may finally lead to malfunctioning or even disabling the ICS for a long time. The consequences are financial loss and in some cases, catastrophic events affecting our lives. Two solutions can improve the availability: increasing the Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) or decreasing the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR). Current approaches which try to improve the security of ICS use the first solution. Nevertheless, decreasing the MTTR is more effective thus a recovery scheme for ICS is proposed here. Using the proposed scheme, the ICS is recovered from a compromised state and is put into a stable state. Preliminary experiments show that this scheme can significantly decrease the MTTR and improve the ICS availability.","","978-1-4673-6489-8","","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620079","Industrial Control System;Recovery;Security;System availability","Availability;Control systems;Educational institutions;Industrial control;Security;Servers;Workstations","industrial control;reliability;system recovery","ICS availability;MTTF;MTTR;cyber attack;industrial control systems;mean time to failure;mean time to recovery;recovery scheme","","0","","17","","","28-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key pre-distribution scheme is proposed such that nodes in the route share keys while those that are not in the route do not share keys with nodes that are in the route. Simulations have been done for both small and large areas, low and high density, on-route and non-route connectivity scenarios.

In recent years Machine learning classification techniques have been used to precisely identify network intrusion. However, the multi class distribution in network intrusion detection system has found to be highly skewed, leading to classification accuracy problem due to class imbalance data set. The work presented in this paper not only explores the role of the attribute selection in improving classification accuracy but also investigates the problem of class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) and under sampling of major classes. The classification performance is then evaluated over several types of classifiers. The outcome of this work is that for the class imbalance data set the under-sampling technique is more effective than SMOTE in detecting minor classes. It has also found during this research work that the decision tree algorithms (JRIP) and NaiÌˆve Bayes are more accurate classifiers as compared to the Radial basis neural network and support vector machine. However no single algorithm can be used for the classification of multiclass and it is proposed in this research work that combination of classifier consisting of NaiÌˆve Bayes and JRIP could be used for the classification of minor classes in an imbalance class data set of intrusion detection system.","","978-1-4673-1366-7","","10.1109/UKSim.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205441","Class imbalance;Feature Selection;Network intrusion;Support Vector Machines","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;computer network security;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","JRIP;NID systems;Naive Bayes method;SMOTE;attribute selection;class imbalance classification;classification accuracy problem;decision tree algorithms;feature selection;machine learning classification techniques;multiclass classification;multiclass distribution;network intrusion detection systems;network intrusions identification;radial basis neural network;support vector machine;synthetic minority over-sampling;under-sampling technique","","0","","22","","","28-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Management of these processors and other system resources to achieve high forwarding rates is a key challenge. In particular, the allocation of processing workloads and the placement of data structures in memory have an enormous impact on system performance. Our work proposes a runtime system that manages these system resources. Much related work has proposed the use of cache memory hierarchies in packet processors.

The performance of an intrusion detection system is dependent on two metrics: throughput and the total number of patterns that can fit on a device. In this paper, we consider the FPGA implementation details of the bit-split string-matching architecture. The bit-split algorithm allows large hardware state machines to be converted into a form with much higher memory efficiency. We extend the architecture to satisfy the requirements of the IDS state-of-the-art. We show that the architecture can be effectively optimized for FPGA implementation. We have optimized the pattern memory system parameters and developed new interface hardware for communicating with an external controller. The overall performance (bandwidth * number of patterns) is competitive with other memory-based string matching architectures implemented in FPGA.","","1-4244-0054-6","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639434","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Control systems;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Memory architecture;Pattern matching;Software performance;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;reconfigurable architectures;security of data;string matching;telecommunication security","bit-split string-matching architecture;field-programmable gate array;hardware state machine;interface hardware;intrusion detection system;network security;pattern memory system parameter;reconfigurable hardware","","11","1","20","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Bayesian method has been used in the past on weather forecasting and has been expanded so that it can be used to provide enhanced network security by trying to predict user actions. For this a system can determine if a user is acting unpredictably or has changed their normal working pattern.

Consequently, this calls for NIDS to have wire-speed packet processing and real-time detection of malicious traffic. Snort is the most popular NIDS. Snort is an open source software-based NIDS and runs as a single threaded application. Snort processing and detection capabilities can be limited in networks with 1 and 10 Gbps network links. To overcome such a limitation, we present a design and implementation of two layer NIDS for accelerating Snort detection. The design combines hardware and software components whereby Snort operates as the second line of defense after hardware-assisted inspection of packet headers. In our design, Snort's frequently used rules are offloaded from Snort to a NetFPGA-based hardware layer. The NetFPGA implementation is based on Bloom filter to analyze and filter incoming packets with header fields matching those of frequently used rules. The second line of defense will dynamically offload the most frequently triggered rules to the NetFPGA and will only be executed if deep packet analysis is required for the incoming packet. The experimental results show a significant improvement in the CPU usage and an enormous reduction in packet loss when using Snort with NetFPGA filtering.","","978-1-4799-7324-8","","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906470","Bloom filter;Intrusion detection system;NetFPGA;Network Security;Snort","Acceleration;Hardware;Matched filters;Pattern matching;Ports (Computers);Software","computer network security;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;hardware-software codesign;microprocessor chips","CPU usage;NetFPGA filtering;NetFPGA-based Bloom filter;NetFPGA-based hardware layer;bit rate 1 Gbit/s;bit rate 10 Gbit/s;hardware-assisted inspection;network intrusion detection systems;network links;open source software-based NIDS;packet analysis;packet headers;packet loss;snort NIDS;snort detection capabilities;snort processing capabilities;wire-speed packet processing","","0","","33","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose new NFA-Split architecture, which reduces the amount of consumed FPGA resources in order to match larger set of regular expressions at multi-gigabit speed. The proposed reduction uses model of nondeterministic and deterministic automaton for effective mapping of regular expressions to FPGA. A new algorithm is designed to split the nondeterministic automaton transition table in order to map a part of the table into memory. The algorithm can place more than 49% of transition table to memory, which reduces the amount of look-up tables by more than 43% and flip-flops by more than 38% for all selected sets of regular expressions. Moreover, a sparse transition table is mapped to memory with overlapped rows, which enables to store the table in a highly compact form.","","978-1-4244-6612-2","","10.1109/DDECS.2010.5491816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491816","","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Field programmable gate arrays;Flip-flops;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Logic;Pattern matching;Viruses (medical)","computer network security;deterministic automata;field programmable gate arrays;pattern matching","FPGA;NFA-Split architecture;deterministic automaton;fast regular expression matching;flip flops;intrusion detection systems;look-up tables;malicious attacks;network attacks;nondeterministic automaton transition table;pattern matching;sparse transition table;viruses","","2","","21","","","14-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By analysing network traffic, S-IDS' detect network intrusions. An organisation may deploy one or multiple S-IDS', each working independently with the assumption that it can monitor all packets of a given flow to detect intrusion signatures. However, emerging technologies (e.g., Multi-Path TCP) violate this assumption, as traffic can be concurrently sent across different paths (e.g., WiFi, Cellular) to boost network performance. Attackers may exploit this capability and split malicious payloads across multiple paths to evade traditional signature-based network intrusion detection systems. Although multiple monitors may be deployed, none of them has the full coverage of the network traffic to detect the intrusion signature. In this paper, we formalise this distributed signature-based intrusion detection problem as an asynchronous online exact string matching problem, and propose an algorithm for it. To demonstrate its effectiveness we conducted comprehensive experiments.

An intrusion detection method based on Markov chain was presented. For every network packet, three major groups of features were extracted, and feature sequence was matched into the state of Markov process. Then anomaly activity of network could be detected by constructing Markov chain. Moreover, using a dynamic load-balancing algorithm, it could avoid packet loss in high-performance network and process heavy traffic loads in real-time.

It borrows from several computing techniques - grid computing, cluster computing, software-as-a-service, utility computing, autonomic computing and many more. It provides a whole new deployment model for enterprise web-applications. The cloud proposes significant cost cuts when compared to using an internal IT infrastructure. The ""pay for what you use"" model of cloud computing is significantly cheaper for a company than the ""pay for everything up front"" model of internal IT. Hardware Virtualization is the enabling technology behind many of the cloud infrastructure vendor offerings. Through virtualization, a physical server can be partitioned into any number of virtual servers running their own operating systems, in their allocated memory, CPU and disk footprints. From the perspective of the user or application on the virtual server, no indication exists to suggest that the server is not a real, physical server. In this paper, we make an attempt to enhance dynamic cloud based services using efficient load balancing techniques. We describe various steps involved in developing and utilizing cloud based infrastructure in such a way that cloud based services can be offered to users in an efficient manner. In the design of load balancing algorithms for an application offering cloud based services, the various details described in this paper offer useful insight, while the actual implementation may be based on the exact requirements at hand.","","978-1-4244-9717-1","","10.1109/ICCSE.2011.6028819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6028819","Cloud Based Services;Cloud Computing;Load Balancing;Virtualization","Complexity theory;Hardware;Load management;Memory management;Servers;Time factors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;file servers;grid computing;operating systems (computers);resource allocation;software fault tolerance;storage allocation;virtualisation","CPU;IT infrastructure;autonomic computing;cloud based services;cloud computing;cloud infrastructure vendor offering;cluster computing;enterprise Web-application;grid computing;hardware virtualization;load balancing technique;memory allocation;operating system;physical server;software as a service;utility computing;virtual server","","0","","11","","","3-5 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the consumption of memory space and processing time, our proposed model uses one node per connection instead of using two nodes as appeared in Net filter model. This can reduce memory space and processing time. In addition, we introduce an extended hash table with more hashing bits in our firewall model in order to accommodate more concurrent connections. Moreover, our model also applies sophisticated techniques (such as using static information nodes, and avoiding timer objects and memory management tasks) to improve its processing speed. Finally, we implement this model on Linux Cent OS 6.3 and evaluate its speed.

For balancing detection load, score subtraction approach (SSA) and score addition approach (SAA) are deployed. Furthermore, to effectively detect intrusions, a two-phase packet detection process is proposed. The first phase detects logical and momentary attacks.

The approach is intended for hardware implementation and could be included in the network interface, switch or firewall. Efficient implementation in software on a network host is also possible. Network traffic is characterized using a novel technique that maps packet-level payloads onto a set of counters using bit-pattern hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components and has the potential to provide accurate detection performance due to the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. Results of a preliminary study are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.","","0-7803-8572-1","","10.1109/IAW.2004.1437798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437798","","Computer networks;Counting circuits;Filters;Hardware;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Monitoring;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Switches;Telecommunication traffic","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);real-time systems;security of data;telecommunication security","anomaly detection system;anomaly packet identification;bit-pattern hash function;firewall;high-bandwidth network;machine learning;network interface;network intrusion detection;network traffic","","4","","26","","","10-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In light of these limitations, we have developed LEAPS, an attack detection system based on supervised statistical learning to classify benign and malicious system events. Furthermore, we leverage control flow graphs inferred from the system event logs to enable automatic pruning of the training data, which leads to a more accurate classification model when applied to the testing data.

However, searching for patterns at multiple offsets in entire content of network packet requires more processing power than most general purpose processor can provide. Thus, researchers have developed high performance parallel deep packet filters for reconfigurable devices. Although some reconfigurable systems can be generated automatically from pattern database, obtaining high performance result from each subsequent reconfiguration can be a time consuming process. We present a novel architecture for programmable parallel pattern matching coprocessor. By combining a scalable coprocessor with the compact reconfigurable filter, we produce a hybrid system that is able to update the rules immediate during the time the new filter is being compiled.

Open Flow, a SDN standard, is currently the only standard that explicitly focuses on multi-vendor openness. Unfortunately, it only provides for traffic engineering on an integrated basis for L2-L4. The obvious approaches to expand Open Flow's reach to L7, would be to enhance the data path flow table, or to utilize the controller for deep packet inspection, both introduces significant scalability barriers. We propose and prototype an enhancement to Open Flow based on the idea of an External Processing Box (EPB) optionally attached to forwarding engines, however, we use existing protocol extension constructs to control the EPB as an integrated part of the Open Flow data path. This provides network operators with the ability to use L7-based policies to control service insertion and traffic steering, without breaking the open paradigm. This novel yet eminently practical augmentation of Open Flow provides added value critical for realistic networking practice. Retention of multi-vendor openness for such an approach has not been previously reported in literature to the best of our knowledge.

A number of intrusion detection systems have been proposed for ad-hoc networks. Such intrusion detection systems cannot perform well for wireless mesh networks due to its multihop decentralized architecture. The selection of optimal and secure routing path and detection of multilayer security attacks cannot be achieved using traditional single layer IDS. Most of the MAC layer attacks occur due to non compliance of protocols by the nodes. Such a malicious behavior cannot be detected using conventional IDS. In this paper, a Cross Layer based Intrusion detection system has been proposed which takes advantage of the information available across different layers of protocol by activating multiple layer monitoring and detection. The proposed Cross layer based IDS is novel in its architecture and is able to detect multi layer attacks of compound nature.

The correlation process consists of multiple components, each responsible for a different aspect of the overall correlation goal. The sequential order of the correlation components affects the correlation process performance. Furthermore, the total time needed for the whole process depends on the number of processed alerts in each component. This paper presents an innovative alert correlation framework that minimizes the number of processed alerts on each component and thus reducing the correlation processing time. By reordering the components, the introduced correlation model reduces the number of processed alerts as early as possible by discarding the irrelevant, unreal and false alerts in the early phases of the correlation process. A new component, shushing the alerts, is added to deal with the unrelated and false positive alerts. A modified algorithm for fusing the alerts is outlined. The intruders' intention is grouped into attack scenarios and thus used to detect future attacks. DARPA 2000 intrusion detection scenario specific datasets and a testbed network were used to evaluate the innovative alert correlation model. Comparisons with a previous correlation system were performed. The results of processing these datasets and recognizing the attack patterns demonstrated the potential of the improved correlation model and gave favorable results.","","978-0-9893-1933-1","","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918249","Alert Correlation;Alert Reduction;False Alarm Rate;Intrusion Detection Systems","Collaboration;Correlation;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Pattern recognition","security of data","CIDS;attack patterns;collaborative intrusion alert correlation;collaborative intrusion detection systems;correlation components;correlation process performance;correlation processing time;innovative alert correlation model;innovative framework;intruders intention;modified algorithm;security related activity","","0","","34","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To detect intrusion, in general, Intrusion Detection System(IDS) has a copy step where P packet is captured at kernel level and it is used for detection in user level. While doing this job, the next packet cannot be captured because this procedure isn??t finished yet. This paper proposes the Kernel-level Intrusion Detection System(KIDS) which can detect various network attacks with minimum packet loss. This system is executed in kernel as a kernel program, and can detect intrusion at kernel level without copy step. Dynamic rule change is done quickly through appending and setting a delete mark operation. After this work, it is not needed to reboot a kernel and new type of network attack can be detected easily. With the help of this dynamic rule change, waiting time of detection process is minimized and its job can be continued as quickly as possible. Due to these features, the packet loss is greatly reduced.","","89-5519-119-7","","10.1109/ICACT.2004.1292859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292859","Intrusion Detection System;kernel-level intrusion detection;signature-based detection","Availability;Computer networks;Computer worms;Data security;Delta modulation;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Kernel;Protection;Web and internet services","","","","1","","12","","","9-11 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, local monitoring-based security algorithms are becoming the most popular tool for providing security in WSNs. However, local monitoring as it is currently practiced is costly in terms of energy consumption, a major drawback for energy-constrained systems such as WSNs. In WSN environments, the scarce power resources are typically addressed through sleep-wake scheduling of the nodes. However, sleep-wake scheduling techniques in WSNs are vulnerable even to simple attacks. In this paper, a new technique is proposed that promises to allow operation of WSNs in a manner that is both energy-efficient and secure. The proposed technique combines local monitoring with a novel, more secure form of sleep-wake scheduling. The latter is a new methodology dubbed Elmo (Energy Aware Local MOnitoring in Sensor Networks), which enables sleep-wake management in a secure manner even in the face of adversarial nodes that choose not to awaken nodes responsible for monitoring their traffic. An analytical proof is given showing that security coverage is not weakened under Elmo. Moreover, ns-2 simulation results show that the performance of local monitoring is practically unchanged, while energy savings of 20 to 100 times are achieved, depending on the scenario.","1545-5971","","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654513","Sensor networks;local monitoring;malicious nodes.;sleep/wake techniques;wake-up antenna","Antennas;Monitoring;Protocols;Security;Sleep;Synchronization;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","ELMO;WSN;energy aware local monitoring;energy constrained system;energy consumption;local monitoring based security algorithm;sleep wake management;wireless sensor network","","3","","40","","2010-12-03","July-Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As the usage increased, it has also exposed its users to various security threats. Network forensic techniques can be used to traceback the source and the path of an attack that can be used as a legal evidence in a court of law. Packet attribution techniques like Source Path Isolation (SPIE), Block Bloom Filter (BBF), Hierarchical Bloom Filter (HBF) are proposed to store the packet data into the bloom filters at each router present in the network. All the routers in the Autonomous System (AS) are queried for presence of excerpt in their bloom filters to traceback source and path of attack. Upon receiving the excerpt query, each router search their bloom filters for presence of excerpt and send the result to NMS. NMS receives the response from routers and determines the traceback path from victim to source of attack. In this process, all the routers are engaged in searching the bloom filters, causing possible delay in performing actual routing tasks. This degrades network performance and may adversely affect QoS of network. To address potential performance issues, in this paper, we propose query optimization techniques, reducing the number of routers to be searched to a great extent, without adversely affecting storage and processing requirements as compared to existing attribution methods.","","978-1-4799-8098-7","","10.1109/ISIAS.2014.7064618","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064618","Excerpt Query;Hash-based traceback;Packet Attribution System;Payload Attribution System","Hafnium;IP networks","Internet;computer network security;data structures;digital forensics;optimisation;quality of service;query processing;telecommunication network routing","AS;Internet security;NMS;QoS;autonomous system;bloom filters;excerpt query process optimization;network forensic technique;packet attribution system;packet data store;routing task;source traceback","","0","","18","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to prevent such leakage, we propose the Data Leakage Prevention System (DLPS) which is applied at the entrance of the enterprise network to filter out the outgoing sensitive information. The DLPS is based on a content scanning engine which defines a new type of matching problem, called longest overlap matching which also exits in many other applications as a basic problem where contents are delivered by small blocks. We study the problem by comparing it with the traditional pattern matching problem in Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) whose solutions are based on finite automata. We develop a new finite automata representation called Skip-Finite Automata (Skip-FA) which detects the packets carrying sensitive information by using default transitions to implicitly track the overlapping parts between packets' payloads and sensitive files. The simulation results shows that our system achieves a matching speed of about 10B+ per memory access for small file set (>;20KB) and 100B+ per memory access for large file set (>;2500KB). We also find that the memory consumption of Skip-FA is almost the same to that of the original files.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-5636-9","978-1-4244-5637-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5683165","","Automata;Delay;Engines;IEEE Communications Society;Logic gates;Payloads;Radiation detectors","finite automata;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;telecommunication security","content scanning engine;data leakage prevention system;deep packet inspection;file sharing network;finite automata representation;network intrusion detection system;pattern matching problem;secure enterprise network;skip finite automata;skip finite automaton","","1","","18","","","6-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, insufficiency of memory and battery power of sensors makes sensor networks vulnerable to be attacked. As a second line of defense, intrusion detection system (IDS) is one useful method defending against attacks. In present literatures, most of IDS models in WSN are static IDS (SIDS), which have inherent disadvantages and are not feasible for WSN. This paper proposes a dynamic model of IDS (DIDS) for WSN, which has a remarkable improvement in the security, stability and robustness issues as compared to SIDS. Simulation results show that DIDSpsilas detection rate is 10% higher than SIDS with a range of 15 m and much higher with smaller ranges, and DIDS can prolong the lifetime of networks by 8% on average.","","978-1-4244-2183-1","978-1-4244-2184-8","10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4608028","","Analytical models;Energy efficiency;Event detection;Game theory;Intrusion detection;Military computing;Monitoring;Protection;Robust stability;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","dynamic model;intrusion detection system;wireless sensor network security","","6","","15","","","20-23 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially the development of the third point perhaps improves the passive detection to the active protection. Through the study on patterns of the multi-step attack, a model of alert correlation which is based on self-regulate is designed.

In order to protect information security, significant research and standardizations efforts have been made in recent years. However, most of these activities focus on specific issues, which cannot mitigate negative effects as a whole. In this paper, we first introduce a common architecture of smartphones including main smartphone assets. Then we identify smartphone threats which are clustered into vulnerabilities and attacks. Based on the layered structure of smartphones, we propose a hierarchical security framework for smartphones including hardware security, operating system security, application security, user data security and communication security.

In this scheme every router needs to sign the routing data twice with two different keys using a group keying scheme, which is based on one-way hash function.

Hardware based solutions appear necessary to face the performance requirements emerging when the goal is to deploy such systems in high speed network scenarios. However, the appropriate choice of the hardware platform is believed to be subject to at least two requirements, usually considered independent each other: i) it needs to be reprogrammable, in order to update the intrusion detection rules each time a new threat arises, and ii) it must be capable of containing the typically very large set of rules of existing NIDSs. The goal of this paper is to show that reprogrammability can be further exploited to reduce the resource requirements for the chosen platform. Specifically, we propose an FPGA-based solution that classifies and dispatches traffic to elastic buffers, connecting one buffer at a time to a dynamically reconfigurable rule matching core. This core supports only the appropriate subset of detection rules. A worst-case analysis shows that the saving in hardware resources is achieved with a relatively small buffer space, currently available in cheap, low end, FPGA boards, with no impairment on the resulting throughput.","1946-1488","978-1-4244-7842-2","","10.1109/FPL.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694212","","","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays","FPGA-based solution;NIDS;elastic buffers;network intrusion detection system;network traffic;reconfigurable rule matching core;reprogrammability;worst-case analysis","","5","","13","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has a great potential to be deployed in wide range of applications like consumer, industrial and defense sectors. WSN s are susceptible to various attacks, in which Blackhole a kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is very difficult to detect and defend. In blackhole attack, an adversary captures and re-programs a set of nodes in the network to block the packets they receive instead of forwarding them towards the base station. As a result any information that enters the blackhole region is captured and doesn't reach the destination. Due to this attack, high end-to-end delay is introduced in the network and performance of the network (i.e. throughput) is degraded. In this paper a comparative performance analysis of two WSN's topologies i.e. Tree and Mesh under blackhole attack is done. If there is a WSN prone to blackhole attack and requires time efficient network service for information exchange then Tree topology is to be chosen. If it requires throughput efficient and consistent service in the network then Mesh topology is recommended. An algorithm named as Topology Based Efficient Service Prediction (TBESP) algorithm has been proposed depending upon the analysis done which will help in choosing the best suited topology as per the network service requirement under blackhole attack.","","978-1-4673-4865-2","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577224","Blackhole Attack;End-to-end Delay;Throughput;Topology Based Efficient Service Predication (TBESP) Algorithm;Wireless Sensor Network","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DoS attack;TBESP algorithm;WSN topology;blackhole attack;denial of service attack;mesh topology;network service requirement;topology based efficient service prediction algorithm;tree topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our work, we compare our result with the common method of feature selection is which the Chi-Square (Chi<sup>2</sup>) feature selection. There are 4 main steps in our experiment: Firstly, we start with data pre-processing to discard unnecessary attributes. Secondly, MHGIS feature selection and Chi<sup>2</sup> feature selection have been employed on the pre-processed data, to reduce the number of attributes. Thirdly, we measure the recognition performance by using supervised learning algorithms which are C4.5, BPNN, RBF and SVM. Lastly, we evaluate the results received from MHGIS and Chi<sup>2</sup>. From the KDDCup99 dataset, we got 13,499 randomly sampling patterns with 34 data dimensions. With the use of MHGIS and Chi<sup>2</sup> algorithms, we obtain 14 and 26 features respectively.

Indeed, researchers have identified a number of security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the IEC61850 standard such as the lack of encryption used in the GOOSE messages, lack of intrusion detection system implementation in IEC61850 network, and no firewall implementation inside IEC61850 substation network. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, researchers have also discovered a number of security attacks that can be launched on IEC61850 substation network. These attacks can be categorized into two, which are common network security attacks on IEC61850 network and security attacks that exploit the IEC61850 multicast messages. This paper provides a review of these security attacks in terms of how the attacks are conducted and the subsequent damages that they may cause.","","","","10.1109/ICIMU.2014.7066594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066594","GOOSE;IEC61850;Information Security;LAN;SMV;Simulated Security Attacks;WAN","Computer crime;Local area networks;Protocols;Standards;Substations;Switches","IEC standards;power engineering computing;security of data;substation automation","IEC61850 substation automation system network;network security attacks","","0","","17","","","18-20 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE 802.11 is the defacto wireless standard. It was designed to provide security however it failed to do so. As a result amendments/enhancements were made to overcome the flaws by first introducing Wi-Fi protected access (WPA) and then IEEE 802.11i. But both these enhancements failed to achieve the desired objectives especially availability. Unauthenticated management and control frames provide no protection against identity theft and are main cause of denial of service (DoS) attacks. Spoofed disassociation messages can successfully be used to launch DoS attacks. In this paper we have explained the DoS attack and carried out a survey / analysis of various solutions for this attack.","","978-9957-486-00-6","","10.1109/MCWC.2006.4375225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375225","802.11;Denial of service DoS;Disassociation;Wireless security","Access control;Access protocols;Authentication;Communication system security;Computer crime;Cryptography;Data security;Microwave integrated circuits;Phase shift keying;Protection","IEEE standards;telecommunication standards;wireless LAN","DoS attack;IEEE 802.11;Wi Fi protected access;denial of service attacks;local area networks;wireless standard","","4","","51","","","17-20 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most of closed-network SCADA systems have been considered as very secure against cyber-attacks. Because they use their own operating systems and communication/ network protocols, and their private networks are physically isolated from the public networks and the Internet. However, in case the closed SCADA system has m-connected status due to its maintenance, updates, and patches, it is no longer perfectly secure against cyber-attacks. This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of m-connected SCADA networks and proposes a novel security model for detecting network anomalies. The proposed model is based on an intrusion detection system using the network-based pattern reference method, which has two kinds of rule sets - one is the base rule set, and the other is dynamically produced rule set. The basic rule set can be set with pre-known intrusion patterns, and a dynamically produced new rule set can be set by detecting network anomalies under specific threshold values. Such new rule set would be adapted to the pattern reference model in its next execution time. Therefore, the proposed security model can identify abnormal command execution more effectively and efficiently.","","","","10.1109/BWCCA.2013.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690909","Anomaly Detection;IDS;SCADA;Secure Service","Internet;Intrusion detection;Monitoring;Protocols;SCADA systems;Servers","Internet;SCADA systems;computer network security;critical infrastructures;cryptographic protocols;operating systems (computers)","Internet;abnormal command execution identification;base rule set;communication protocol;dynamically produced rule set;intrusion detection system;m-connected SCADA network vulnerability;m-connected status;national critical infrastructure;network anomaly detection;network protocol;network-based pattern reference method;operating systems;pattern reference model;pre-known intrusion pattern;private network;public network;security model;specific threshold value;supervisory control and data acquisition","","0","","12","","","28-30 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such applications typically comprise a complex pipeline of processing components that capture, transform and analyze the incoming data stream. In addition, applications must provide high throughput, be scalable and easily modifiable so that new analytical components can be added with minimum effort. In this paper we describe the MeDICi integration framework (MIF), which is a middleware platform we have created to address these challenges. The MIF extends an open source messaging platform with a component-based API for integrating components into analytical pipelines. We describe the features and capabilities of the MIF, and show how it has been used to build a production analytical application for detecting cyber security attacks. The application was composed from multiple independently developed components using several different programming languages. The resulting application was able to process network sensor traffic in real time and provide insightful feedback to network analysts as soon as potential attacks were recognized.","","978-0-7695-3092-5","","10.1109/WICSA.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459148","component model;integration;pipelines","Application software;Computer security;Data analysis;Independent component analysis;Middleware;Performance analysis;Pipelines;Production;Software engineering;Throughput","data analysis;middleware;object-oriented programming;pipeline processing;security of data","API;MeDICi integration framework;cyber security attack detection;high performance data streaming application;middleware;network sensor traffic;open source messaging platform;pipeline processing component;production analytical application;programming language;software engineering problem","","5","","22","","","18-21 Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IDS can use signatures or abnormal behaviors to detect attacks. When IDS uses signatures, in order to detect more attacks, we have to implement more attack signatures on IDS. However, in resource-constrained wireless sensor networks, it is not efficient to implement all of attack signatures. And it is hard to maintain attack signature database because it should be updated frequently when new kind of attacks appear. In this paper, we propose a distributed IDS mechanism which reduces the usage of memory and overhead.

The scheme precludes the security problems by utilizing the useful metaphors of biological immunity and the prominent characteristics of mobile agent, and is characterized by parallel operating, stability, adaptability and robustness.

In this paper, we propose a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) with semantics-aware capability. Our NIDS segregates suspicious traffic from the regular traffic flow, extracts binary code from the suspicious traffic, and performs semantic analysis on it to identify potential threats. Our contributions in this work are threefold: (a) we believe our prototype is the first NIDS that provides semantics-aware capability, (b) our implementation is more efficient than what is reported in (M. Christodorescu et al., 2005) (c) our designed templates can capture polymorphic shellcodes with added sequences of stack and mathematic operations.","","1-4244-0054-6","","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639678","","Binary codes;Computer science;Computer worms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Prototypes;Telecommunication traffic;Viruses (medical)","Internet;binary codes;security of data;telecommunication traffic","Internet;binary code;malicious network traffic;network intrusion detection;semantics-aware capability","","0","1","19","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Log acquisition is the process to collect log from available sources such as operating system logs, virtual machine logs, and service provider logs. Each log file contains many pieces of information that can be invaluable if you know how to read them, and how to analyze data from a perimeter defense view point to identify scans, intrusion attempts, misconfigured equipment, and other noteworthy items. In this paper, we have implemented a dashboard to observe log files which can be used as monitoring, compliance and audit, and an improvement in defense mechanism for a private cloud environment using Eucalyptus. These log files are collected and stored in database, and monitored as well.
